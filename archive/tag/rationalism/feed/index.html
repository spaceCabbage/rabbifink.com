				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The term Rationalist Judaism has been clanking around the Internet and Orthodox Jewish conversation for a while now. It’s not quite a movement, but there are some very strong contemporary voices behind Rationalist Judaism. Many people think the term is an oxymoron. Others think it is intellectually dishonest. Yet others think it is heresy. But without a working definition or at least a framework to understand what we are talking about, any conversation about Rationalist Judaism will result in people talking past one another and miscommunication.<span id="more-7938"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7939" alt="Thinking-Man-Rodin" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin-600x381.jpg" /></a>First, to address the complaint that calling one brand of Judaism “Rationalist” is insulting or offensive to everyone else. It sure seems like the term is implying that everyone else is irrational. This is not the correct implication. Rationalist Judaism is not to the exclusion of irrationality. Instead it is to exclusion of supernaturalism. That’s not to say that mysticism is inherently irrational either. Maybe it is for some. These are just the words that are used to describe two different approaches to God and Judaism. Words are often cumbersome and imprecise. That is the case here. We don’t mean to say Rationalist Judaism is rational and everyone else is irrational.</p>
<p>In general, rationalism literally means to use reason above all else. In this view, truth can be deduced and is not subject to fallacies like appeals to authority or <em>argumentum ad populum</em>. Obviously, a religious person maintains some belief in authority and relies on some subjective baseline truths that cannot be logically argued. But we are not talking about pure rationalism. We are talking about Rationalist Judaism.</p>
<p>I believe that term Rationalist Judaism was adapted from the term Theistic Rationalism. Both groups share some common principles. The basic idea of both groups is to release theology from supernaturalism and focus on morality. To the extent that supernaturalism can be justifiably removed from religion, Rationalist Judaism holds it should be removed. That is all Rationalist Judaism really means.</p>
<p>There are several heroes and champions of this concept, none greater than Rambam. In his halachic and philosophical works, Rambam sought to eliminate superstition, mysticism, and supernaturalism from Judaism to the greatest extent possible. One overriding theme of his works is that there is nothing supernatural other than God. Giving power to charms, incantations, or even angels is akin to idol worship. He held that belief in God was logical. He held that prophecy was a natural result of perfection. He held that God rarely intervenes with nature. He held that <em>Mitzvos</em> have material benefits for the person who performs the Mitzvah. He held that astrology was bunk. He held that God conformed the Torah to the needs of mankind. He held that <em>Maaseh Breishis</em> was science. He held that <em>Maaseh </em><em>Merkava</em>h was metaphysics. There is not a single mystical idea mentioned in any of his books. It’s as if there is no such thing as mysticism in Rambam’s universe.</p>
<p>Some have tried to argue that Rambam was a mystic and obscured his true views. This has been thoroughly debunked by many great scholars and if you are of this mind, I direct you to this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158" target="_blank">Maimonides’ Confrontation with Mysticism</a></p>
<p>There are many other examples of great Torah authorities who used similar principles in their halachic, or philosophical, or exegetical works. R’ Samson Raphael Hirsch wrote Horeb, a book of the philosophy of <em>mitzvos</em> without a single kabbalistic reference. The entire book makes sense of Torah Judaism and it all works even if one rejects mysticism.</p>
<p>Ralbag is another. His commentary on Chumash literally reinterprets examples of supernatural events into metaphors or visions instead of real life occurrences. His worldview fit this same broad category. To the extent that supernaturalism could be excised from Torah and Judaism, he saw to it that they were.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Rationalist Judaism. It’s a tradition that has a long and powerful chain of great Torah luminaries who lived by this philosophy.</p>
<p>Another important element of Rationalist Judaism is that because God’s intervention and communication with man is so limited, the Mesorah and Holy texts of Judaism are more subject to error than one who believes that God ensures the truth of everything. In the opposing view, God’s essence permeates the writings of men like the great Talmudic scholars known as Chazal. Thus, their writings are presumed to be free of mistakes or misjudgments. Rationalist Judaism holds that the best efforts of man can still result in error. This is especially true in matters that are not Torah specific. We refer here to math, science, history, medicine, and other disciplines not directly related to Torah. However, even if Chazal were to err in issues of halacha or Torah specific interpretation, it would not matter as they have the authority to establish the laws for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>It’s true that this sort of thinking led many people to conclusions that we would reject today. Rambam himself was of the belief that God’s existence is provable. Rambam also thought Aristotelian philosophy and science were as true as God’s word in the Torah. We know that both of these are actually untrue. Does this mean that Rationalist Judaism is wrong? Of course not.</p>
<p>In fact, only someone whose paradigm is that Torah authorities are infallible would argue that by disproving Aristotle the entire worldview of Rambam is incorrect. But the paradigm of Rationalist Judaism does not allow for this sort of thinking. People do err, only God is infallible. So Rambam dealt with truth in the same way Chazal dealt with truth. That is, they were subject to the thinking and common beliefs of their time. We are also subject to the thinking and common beliefs of our time. Therefore, we are also supposed to look at Torah through the prism of modern thinking. No one actually pretends that Rambam was a Modern Orthodox Jew of 2013 America. But his worldview is one that allows, or even requires, using contemporary thinking to build one’s Jewish life. That’s what Chazal did and that is what Rambam did and that is what we are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Rambam is not making the claim that Chazal and the prophets before them lived and believed the same way he believed. Rather he is making the argument that with the same information available to Rambam they would have drawn the same conclusions as Rambam. Further, he demonstrates that so much of what they did say is compatible with his Aristotelian, Islamic influenced philosophy. However, even if they would have not reached the same conclusions, they would have used all the available information and evidence to formulate their views. That is what Rationalist Judaism attempts to do as it has always attempted to do.</p>
<p>But what’s the point of all this? Isn’t it obvious that there are supernatural forces and that Judaism believes in mysticism?</p>
<p>The answer to this very serious question is that Rambam held that these were all corruptions. In his view, true Judaism does not have any of the trappings of a supernaturalist cult. God is supernatural, a few miracles that were necessary for the birth of our nation occurred in Biblical times, but other than that, Judaism is a religion that is supposed to be hyper-focused on the practical matters of personal growth and emulating God in our lives.</p>
<p>Sure, many great people introduced mystical or supernatural elements into Judaism. Most people believe in them too. But in Rambam’s view, these are human additions and emendations. They are not integral to serving God, and may in fact harm our service of God.</p>
<p>For someone who believes in the supernatural and mystical this all sounds crazy. That’s fine. However, not everyone is predisposed to believing in things that they can’t see or prove. Those people may still be willing to suspend their disbelief or skepticism and believe in God or even in Divine Revelation. However, if they are not required to believe in mysticism and its trappings of Zoharic and Lurianic kabbalism, the ties to astrology, the use of charms and <em>segulos</em>, the existence of demons, the belief that human beings can be infallible, the idea that Chazal had access to modern science (but didn’t tell everyone about penicillin), that God still communicates with humans (but only to Orthodox Jews), and many other beliefs that require active supernaturalism and a healthy dose of non-skepticism, then why should they believe in those things? Further, if they were required to believe in these things, would it surprise us if they rejected the entire package? No, it would not. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/16/judaism-of-the-future-my-response-to-klal-perspectives-spring-2012/" target="_blank">Judaism of the Future: My Response to Klal Perspectives Spring 2012</a>)</p>
<p>Rationalist Judaism is a real thing. It’s not a fantasy. It’s not a boogeyman that seeks to demonize those who believe in supernatural Judaism. It’s an alternative for people who are more skeptical. It’s a way of serving God without being forced to believe in an entire universe that stretches beyond what is acceptable in their view. There are other side benefits to this perspective. Some of them have already been discussed on this and other blogs. One of those benefits will be the subject of a future post.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that one can practice Orthodox Judaism and love God and make a Kiddush Hashem without mysticism. It still works. Perhaps it even works better. But no matter how one practices their Judaism, it is wise to establish both views as viable options. In this way, we can ensure that the personality types that are drawn to mysticism and skepticism have a place in Orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7292" alt="MATZOH-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>The NY Times must be learning Daf Yomi. Just when we all started learning about the laws of chametz and matzah, the Times runs a front page above the fold story on Satmar A (as opposed to Satmar Z) protocols for matzah baking. It seems that Satmar A, and maybe others I really don&#8217;t know, are not satisfied with the &#8220;<em>shmura m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; and add an extra layer of stringency. They are careful to use wheat that did not even become wet while it was growing. They grow wheat on a far flung farm in Arizona where there is no rain for months while the wheat grows.</p>
<p>Why do they do this?</p>
<p>Halacha requires that we use &#8220;Shmurah Matzah&#8221; at the Seder (and some authorities say all Pesach). Shmura Matzah is not synonymous with round, dark matzah. Matzah can be Shmurah and any shape. Shmurah means that the ingredients for the Matzah were watched to ensure that the grains did not become leaven by coming in contact with water and not being baked within 18 minutes. There are three opinions in halacha as to when the ingredients for matzah must be &#8220;watched&#8221; in order to qualify for &#8220;Shmurah Matzah.&#8221; The most &#8220;watched&#8221; that halacha requires in that the wheat be watched from the time of harvesting. That is why most Matzah says &#8220;<em>Shmurah m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; &#8211; watched from the time of reaping.</p>
<p>There are no opinions in halacha that require that the grains not come in contact with water before they are reaped. None that I could find at least.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on here?<span id="more-7290"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times tells us exactly what is going on here. Here is what Professor Samuel Heilman has to say:</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;the competition between the two Satmar groups — each led by one of two brothers — was about one-upmanship.</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“One is always looking to be more authoritative than the other,” Professor Heilman said, “and one of the ways they’re making this happen is over matzo — our matzo is more kosher than yours, we’re more scrupulous and careful over matzo baking than you are.”</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">One-upmanship in halacha. Nailed it. When so many of us are mitzvah observant we need to do things to signal to others that we are different. We are better. That signal is the extra level of stringency that is completely unnecessary. For more on this social phenomenon check this out: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/19/suggestion-read-judaism-as-a-first-language-right-now/">Judaism as a First Language</a></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">But I think there is something more happening here. While it is true that there may be nothing wrong with being extra stringent, this kind of stringency borders on silliness. The concern that created the requirement to use Shmurah Matzah is that the wheat will actually become chametz. If water comes in contact with flour while it is in storage the wheat can become chametz. That&#8217;s science. But it is literally impossible for grains that are still growing to become Chametz. Impossible. In much the same way that it is impossible for cooked matzah to become chametz if it comes in contact with liquid. Yet, there are thousands of Jews who don&#8217;t eat <em>gebrukst </em>because of that very concern.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Adding stringencies like <em>gebrukst</em> and growing wheat where there is no rain only makes sense in one context. If Judaism is a magical, mystical, mystery and our rational minds are useless to understand the laws of Judaism then it does not matter that there is no possibility of becoming chametz. All that matters is that water and wheat do not come in contact ever. Even if the prohibition is against chametz and not all wheat and water become chametz it does not matter. But if Judaism is a religion with Divine instructions that are supposed to be understood as rationally as possible and the rules tell us what our concerns are supposed to be, there is not place for non-sensical stringencies.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">When it comes to chametz, we are given specific instructions as to what the prohibition entails. The law requires us to be careful not to let the wheat and water ferment and begin to rise. It&#8217;s based on science. Anything that could help prevent that from happening is a reasonable stringency. But once we get into the kind of stringencies that will not prevent a violation of a prohibition, it is hard to see their value unless we say something magical is happening and that wheat and water may never touch. The thing is, that&#8217;s not what the Torah, Talmud, Shulchan Aruch, and responsa tell us. To them, it has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do mysticism.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Now I think I can understand why the NY Times found this so interesting. Growing wheat in Arizona so it doesn&#8217;t rain on the wheat? It&#8217;s irrational. It is religion without reason. It&#8217;s exotic, archaic, and mystical. It&#8217;s not the Judaism that so many of us practice. It&#8217;s a Judaism that almost purposely does not make rational sense and is purely mystical. That&#8217;s front page news.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6919" alt="A-7-toward-A-8" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-7-toward-A-8-300x203.jpg" width="300" height="203" />It&#8217;s amazing how often I can be talking with someone about Rambam and they are surprised when I tell them that it seems to me that Maimonides rejected mysticism. I am almost certain of it and I can show how it is a very nearly impossible presumption to disprove. But greater minds than mine have either doubted or rejected this claim so I try to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>There are four typical responses when people first hear that Rambam rejected mysticism:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s not true. They&#8217;ll quote the Brisker Rav who supposedly said that every line in the Moreh Nevuchim is based on 100 lines in the Zohar. Or the the Lubavitch view that Rambam was such a deep writer that it only appears to be &#8220;nigleh&#8221; but really it&#8217;s all nistar.</p>
<p>2) Nebach, Rambam never had a chance to learn real kabbalah because he was isolated. But if he did, he would have been a mystic for sure.</p>
<p>3) Of course Rambam held of mysticism, he just did not anything mystical in his books for some reason. [Insert reason]
<p>4) That&#8217;s cool. Tell me more.</p>
<p>I teach a Rambam class on Sunday mornings.<span id="more-6904"></span> We just learn Mishneh Torah and I provide insights based on the commentaries and my own personal experiences. From time to time, we learn a law in the text that reaffirms the rationalistic tendencies of Rambam. Here is an example.</p>
<p>מי שנידוהו בחלום אפילו ידע מי נידהו צריך עשרה בני אדם ששונין הלכות להתירו מנידויו ואם לא מצא טורח אחריהם עד פרסא לא מצא מתירים לו אפילו עשרה ששונים משנה לא מצא מתירין לו עשרה שיודעים לקרות בתורה לא מצא מתירין לו אפילו עשרה שאינן יודעין לקרות לא מצא במקומו עשרה מתירין לו אפילו שלשה.</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means if someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication. If he can&#8217;t find 10 people he should walk up to a <em>parsa</em> to find the requisite number of people.</p>
<p>From where does Rambam get this law? From the Talmud.</p>
<p>(אמר רב יוסף: נידוהו בחלום, צריך עשרה בני אדם להתיר לו.והוא דתנו הלכתא; אבל מתנו ולא תנו, לא. ואי ליכא דתנו הלכתא, אפילו מתנו ולא תנו.ואי ליכא, ליזיל וליתב אפרשת דרכים, ויהיב שלמא לבי עשרה, עד דמקלעי ליה עשרה דגמרי הלכתא. (נדרים ח א</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means that someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication, if he can&#8217;t find 1o people he should wait at the פרשת דרכים &#8211; junction &#8211; until he finds enough people.</p>
<p>The medieval commentators explain why he should go to the junction. Some say that he should greet everyone who he sees with a Shalom Aleichem and they will reply Aleichem Shalom. This will protect him from the apparent decree that has been decided against him as shown by the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>This interpretation assumes that the blessing of Aleichem Shalom actually protects someone. This is a mystical idea.</p>
<p>Rambam is uncomfortable with this idea. So either he uses a variant text (I have not seen any manuscripts with this text) or he changes the words פרשת דרכים to the word פרסא. They sound similar, but they have completely different meanings in this context. If you go with the concept found in the Talmud you are relying on mysticism to &#8220;keep you safe&#8221; until you can properly nullify the dreamy excommunication. If you go with Rambam&#8217;s version, it&#8217;s just a limitation on how far one must go to find people to nullify the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the explanation for this law in the Mishneh Torah has nothing to do with mysticism and rationalism? Sure. But the most elegant explanation is that Rambam made a conscious choice to excise this mystical idea from his book of law. Especially when you consider this example among the mountains of other similar instances.</p>
<p>All this means is that Rambam seems to have made an effort to be as rationalist as possible in the Mishneh Torah. Further conclusions are conjecture. Personally, when I see 100 signs telling me to go one direction, I figure that I should go in that direction. To me it seems that Rambam theologically rejected mysticism in every instance possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/antisemitism.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6503" title="antisemitism" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/antisemitism-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="300" /></a>At times like these, when Israel engages in a military operation and the world watches, two things are guaranteed: There will be biased or unfair reporting against Israel and there will be claims of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism is an interesting thing. There certainly is precedent for Jew Hating and Jew Killing. Historically, this was an ideological position that was espoused by dominant religion against Jews. Whether it was Christians or Muslims, Jew hating was part of their religious beliefs. As the Western World became less fervently religious anti-Semitism spilled over into the secular world as well.</p>
<p>Along with anti-Semitism, dominant groups have long hated the &#8220;other&#8221;. Sometimes dominant groups hated each other. There are minorities in the United States of America, Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, that suffer discrimination on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t argue whether there is something &#8220;different&#8221; about anti-Semitism or not in this post. I am not convinced that hating Jews is catergorically different than hating any other &#8220;different group&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rabbi Slifkin, who I love and with whom I have the pleasure of a personal friendship, argues in his recent post that anti-Semitism can be used as a source of inspiration to believe in God.<span id="more-6502"></span></p>
<p>Here is the punchline:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many readers are struggling with the fundamentals of faith. Is it rational to believe that there is something special about the Jews? That we are the chosen people? Aren&#8217;t we just yet another nation with delusions of grandeur?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think that one can also draw faith, albeit in an odd way, from the blood libel, especially in its contemporary incarnation. In the entire global history of armed conflict, no nation has done remotely as much as Israel to minimize civilian (and even military) casualties amongst its enemies. Yet simultaneously, no nation receives remotely as much condemnation for killing civilians!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Is this normal?! Does this reflect a world in which there is nothing other than the order of nature?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Like I said, it&#8217;s somewhat odd to draw faith from something negative. But I find it to be an enormously powerful example of how there is something unique about the Jewish People. Overwhelming, bizarrely irrational global hatred; and yet we have survived, and returned to our homeland. Am Yisrael Chai!</em></p>
<p>I agree with Rabbi Slifkin that we should definitely try to draw faith from wherever we can draw it. I&#8217;ve written the same thing in a different context.</p>
<p>However, I was curious if Rabbi Slifkin actually meant that anti-Semitism is due to some supernatural cause or if it was simply irrational for people to hate Jews. His answer? The former. In other words, according to Rabbi Slifkin, the world&#8217;s irrational hatred for us is Divinely ordained. (I think that is what he was saying. I am not trying to put words in his mouth.)</p>
<p>While I said above that I won&#8217;t argue whether the phenomena of anti-Semitism is unique, I also will not argue that it is not irrational. But I will argue that just because it might be unique and irrational it does not imply that God is causing anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>The view of Maimonides (and some would argue Nachmanides) regarding God&#8217;s interaction with the world is that it is limited. It mostly manifests itself through Nature, as created by God. Miracles occur from time to time and bend or break the rules of nature. Not everyone agrees with this view of God&#8217;s interaction with the world. Certainly there are much more expansive views and in fact those views have taken hold in orthodox Judaism as mainstream opinions.</p>
<p>Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s website is called Rationalist Judaism. While there is no such thing as pure Rationalism when it comes to Judaism, there are some basic principles to Rationalist Judaism. One of those principles, I believe, is &#8220;minimalism&#8221;. That is, when there is no need to rely on a supernatural phenomena or a fantastical interpretation, Rationalist Judaism does not do so. If we say that anti-Semitism is supernatural, I think we are saying that God interferes with nature and puts the anti-Semitism into the world. I think that is what it means when we say that anti-Semitism is Divine.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument let us presume that anti-Semitism is unique and irrational. I don&#8217;t believe that it implies Divinity. Hatred of other groups is also unique (maybe) and definitely irrational. Would we make the same claim and say that those minorities are persecuted by some Divine measure? I don&#8217;t think Rationalist Judaism would. Which leaves me to wonder, why would we do so when it comes to hatred or dehumanization of us Jews?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we are forced to say that anti-Semitism implies a supernatural cause. Unless one already believes <em>everything</em> is caused supernaturally (a fine, traditional position) I don&#8217;t see why anti-Semitism should be different.</p>
<p><em>Lest you invoke &#8220;Halacha Yadua Eisav Soneh l&#8217;Yaakov&#8221; see this excellent article by Rabbi Adlerstein: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2006/09/05/is-antisemitism-universal/" target="_blank">Is Anti-Semitism Universal?</a></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/193920.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5728" title="193920" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/193920-233x300.png" alt="" width="233" height="300" /></a>The NFL has decided to give the fans the Holy Grail of NFL Football, the All-22 video.</p>
<p>What is this Holy Grail? It is the film that NFL coaches receive. It is different than broadcast footage because the broadcast only shows a small part of the game. The quarterback is the main focus of the broadcast and the viewer at home does not see what the wide receivers are doing nor do the viewers get a full grasp of how the defense covers the receivers or disguises blitzes. In short, the broadcast footage is very limited in what it allows the viewers at home to see.</p>
<p>ESPN got a very small percentage of All-22 for the NFL Matchup show. But in general, we the public, have never seen enough All-22 to understand the very complex game of the NFL completely.</p>
<p>The All-22 footage gives the viewer a full view of all 22 players on every play. It shows how the schemes look before the play and how the players move through the play. It is the definitive source of all NFL information. It shows everything.</p>
<p><span id="more-5726"></span></p>
<p>For years, the NFL has resisted giving away the All-22 film to the public. Their reasoning was that the public cannot handle the information. They are not initiated in the ways of NFL football like the coaches are and they will misinterpret the information. This will open the players and coaches to unwarranted criticism. Further, the broadcasters do have the All-22 during the game. That&#8217;s how they sound so smart. If people see what the broadcasters see, they will see behind the curtain and realize they are not that smart after all, they just have access to more information.</p>
<p>Now that will all change. We will all be able to see the All-22 footage. The NFL no longer holds the keys to the Ferarri. We all do now.</p>
<p>To me, is representative of a fundamental change in the way we approach information in 2012. Knowledge, wisdom, and information are expected to be accessible to all. They are expected to be available to anyone who wants it. This is the generation of Wikipedia. This is the generation of Google. This is the generation of free information.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica was a giant leap in making information accessible to many people. But they still needed to shell out a ton of cash to buy a full set or they could mosey on to the library and read it there. But it was not easy accessible to anyone and everyone. That&#8217;s the old model. Wikipedia is the new model. Free information.</p>
<p>The NFL has caught wind of this. They want to please their young fan base. Eventually they caved to pressure and now the most valuable NFL data is available to the public.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s this got to do with Judaism? Mysticism? Rationalism?</p>
<p>One of my favorite Torah scholars is Chacham Jose Faur. One of his favorite theories about the relationship between Maimonidean rationalism and mysticism / kabbalah is very relevant to this decision by the NFL.</p>
<p>Chacham Faur believes that the core of the battle between rationalism and mysticism is the accessibility of knowledge. In the mystical view, kabbalah is received wisdom that comes from great scholars and is imparted to great scholars only. It is not accessible to the masses as it is deemed too dangerous or too esoteric for the common people to grasp. Laws  can be changed based upon this extremely private knowledge base and it can even usurp revealed Torah found in the Talmud. It is so powerful, yet so few can gain entry into the kabbalah club. It takes years of Torah study and personal growth to be worthy of hearing this mystical knowledge.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, we find the teachings of Maimonides. It was his desire to turn this model on its head. Knowledge was to be accessible to all. The Mishneh Torah was written so that everyone who could read was able to access the core text of Judaism. It no longer required a process by which one had to prove himself to be worthy of knowing the law. It was available to everyone. Free information.</p>
<p>This was one of the primary arguments against the Mishneh Torah. It made things too easy.</p>
<p>But to a rationalist, it is impossible to justify keeping wisdom locked away from the public. So Maimonides followed in the footsteps of R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi and made Torah accessible to all.</p>
<p>This tension exists today as well. On one hand we have groups that try to make kaballah more accessible to the masses. But most orthodox Jews find this unacceptable. On the other hand, we have Daas Torah die-hards who are buying into the same structure as the mystics of the medieval era did with regard to policy setting and halachic decisions. The Daas Torah skeptics are more universalist with their approach to Torah and thus believe that everyone has access to all of Torah, not just a select group of Torah giants.</p>
<p>It is harder than ever to maintain the model of the mystics. The NFL finally gave in to the side rationalism and granted the public access to their information. In the orthodox Jewish world a similar struggle is starting and is likely to continue for the next few years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/800px-Human_evolution.svg_.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5696" title="800px-Human_evolution.svg" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/800px-Human_evolution.svg_-300x187.png" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>Some interesting numbers were released by Gallup. They polled Americans on core issues of belief and science and were met with some surprising results.</p>
<p>The numbers are mostly steady over the last 30 years, which also has some significance in my opinion.</p>
<p>Of particular note, are the evolution numbers. 46% of Americans believe that God created the world within the last 10,000 years. 15% believe that humans evolved and God played no role in the process. 32% believe that Humans evolved and God guided the process.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. Science has basically accepted that evolution exists. The 46% that basically deny evolution completely are doing so in direct opposition to logical, rational, evidence-based, thinking.</p>
<p>I am NOT referring to the group that believes that evolution is a mechanism used by God. Those people are reconciling their beliefs with science. Whether it &#8220;works&#8221; or not is a separate discussion. I am only referring to the 46% who flat out disagree with science on the question of evolution.</p>
<p>How does this happen?<span id="more-5695"></span></p>
<p>An article in the New Yorker explains some of the science behind the rejection of science. Turns out that we are deeply embedded beliefs based on what we might call common sense. When science contradicts common sense, even when we <em>know</em> that the science is correct, our brains try to push us in the direction of common sense. It takes <em>effort</em> for our brains to choose what we know to be true when it contradicts our perception of what &#8220;makes sense&#8221;.</p>
<p>Evolution is not something that our brains are comfortable with. It is a difficult thing for us to accept. Common sense does not favor evolution. It is only though research and advanced scientific tools that evolution becomes the reasonable choice.</p>
<p>Even ideas that have 99% acceptance rates work this way. For example, almost everyone agrees that the earth goes around the sun. But common sense says that the sun goes around the earth. The ancients believed that the sun went around the earth and only recently has science proved this to be false. Now we all <em>know </em>that the earth goes around the sun. Yet, when measuring specific brain activity levels, it can be demonstrated that we have a hard time convincing our brains that this is the truth.</p>
<p>This explains the discomfort we feel due to cognitive dissonance. Your brain literally wants to use common sense and it takes effort to follow logic and reason.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? It means that we are preprogrammed to favor common sense. It takes work to override that default position. Sometimes common sense is right but other times it is not right. The greatest tool we have in overriding our default settings is education. The more we know and the more we process new information, the more our brains accept changes to their programming.</p>
<p>When it comes to religious beliefs, even within those who believe in God and are religious there are some more common sense or folksy beliefs that come natural to people. Many of these beliefs are not essential and may even be wrong. But people cling to their folk beliefs despite evidence to the contrary &#8211; <em>even within their own religious texts and writings.</em></p>
<p>This is why Maimonidean Rationalism failed. It takes too much work to deprogram the common sense beliefs in mysticism for it to work for the masses. It&#8217;s been 900 years already and it still isn&#8217;t catching on. Perhaps with new evidence and more information, it will catch on. I sure hope it does.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tours_maimonides_tomb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5515" title="tours_maimonides_tomb" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tours_maimonides_tomb-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>An article in Haaretz caught my eye.</p>
<p>Maimonides was a hyper-rationalist. He did not believe in mysticism and fought vehemently against it. One aspect of mysticism is praying at tombs of holy people. Yet, for hundreds of years people have made pilgrimage to Tiberias in the north of Israel to pay respect a the grave of Maimonides and pray at his tomb.</p>
<p>Compared with other holy sites, the tomb of Maimonides is in need of renovations and a facelift. A $10 million project will spruce up the tomb and make it more inviting for visitors.</p>
<p>The problem is that Maimonides himself felt strongly that one should not make a grave into a holy site.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Donniel Hartmann paraphrased the words of Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah:  &#8221;For holy men, no headstones should be built on their graves because their words are their memory&#8230; and people should not visit graves.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty clear that Maimonides would not be in favor of this renovation or visitors to his tomb.<span id="more-5512"></span></p>
<p>So is it ironic? Or a chutzpah?</p>
<p>It feels similar to Mormons baptizing Jews. It&#8217;s one religious group using their beliefs in an ironic way. Jews don&#8217;t believe in Jesus so we don&#8217;t really care for the Baptism. But Mormons feel like they are doing us a favor. Similarly, Maimonides didn&#8217;t believe in praying at grave sites, but mystics probably feel like they are doing him a favor by praying at his site even though they must think that he was wrong about the whole not praying at grave sites thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find it amusing.</p>
<p>I saved this post for International Jewish Mysticism Day (otherwise known as Lag B&#8217;Omer) to lodge a tiny rationalist counterbalance against the overwhelming mysticism of the day. That is my way of being ironic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/House-Divided.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5363" title="House Divided" alt="" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/House-Divided-295x300.jpg" width="207" height="210" /></a>For the zillionth time since the start of the 19th century, there is a Metzitza b&#8217;Peh controversy. I have nothing particularly new to add to the foray but I do have an insight about the way the lines are drawn in this conflict that may help others understand exactly what is really going on. Every source in this post is found in previous writings. This post is a very broad summary with an important implication.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. The Mishna in Mesechta Shabbos says that we perform a circumcision on Shabbos and also metzitza (suction on the wound to draw out the blood) is performed. Apparently the metzitza was done by placing the mouth on the wound and sucking  The Gemara and the Rambam explain that metzitza is done to promote healing and prevent unnecessary harm from befalling the infant. This is clearly a medical concern. As Dr. Shlomo Sprecher shows in his masterful article on the subject, this was the common view of medicine at the time of the Talmud and through the era of Maimonides. Similar medical views are found in the premier medical treatise of the era, Galen&#8217;s Corpus.<span id="more-5347"></span></p>
<p>In the 19th century, the Jewish community became aware that the medical benefits of metzitza were likely outweighed by the potential harms of metzitza b&#8221;peh. Some rabbis recommended discontinuing the practice. Notably, the Chasam Sofer and R&#8217; Hirsch tried to urge their communities to use a glass tube to create the suction instead of direct contact with the mouth.</p>
<p>Others pushed back. For example, the Maharam Schick elevated metzitzah b&#8217;peh to halacha l&#8217;Moshe m&#8217;Sinai status. This was to make it unimpeachable. It was also the first mention of this halacha l&#8217;Moshe m&#8217;Sinai in recorded history (I believe). The issue was far from settled, even in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The controversy arose again when several babies were diagnosed with a virus and it was presumed that the virus was contracted during metzitza b&#8217;peh. Since that time, many articles have battled over whether the babies were really infected because of metzitza b&#8217;peh or not. Other articles analyze whether or not the baby is actually placed into danger via metzitza b&#8217;peh or not. I am not qualified to have an opinion on this matter. To me, it is irrelevant. Everything we know about sickness and germs tells us that this is a bad idea from a medical standpoint. No one living in the West in 2012 could say with a straight face that placing one&#8217;s mouth over a fresh wound is a great idea. We will ignore this point of contention. It is not relevant for the purposes of this post.</p>
<p>Most recently, Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky was quoted in the The Jewish Week regarding this issue. According to them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In a phone conversation with The Jewish Week, Rabbi Kamenetsky noted that in his community “as far as I know, they do metzitzah with a tube [a sterile pipette that prevents the mouth from directly touching the wound].”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When asked about rabbis who believe that using a tube is not valid under Jewish law, Rabbi Kamenetsky replied, “Nobody holds like that.” Told of those who make this claim, the apparently incredulous rabbi said only, “I don’t think there’s a response to them.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The rabbi also expressed disbelief about those who would insist on the practice despite its links to the transmission of disease to infants.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Chas v’shalom [God forbid], if [children are] getting sick [from oral suction], [you] wouldn’t do it,” under Jewish law, he said.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Rabbi Kamenetsky also stated that because it is permissible to do the suctioning with a tube, which poses “no risk at all” to the infant, this should be the practice.</em></p>
<p>The reaction to this statement among the orthodox community was mostly positive. A survey of comments from the various Jewnews sites seems to indicate a respectful approach to this characterization of R&#8217; Shmuel&#8217;s opinion.</p>
<p>But then R&#8217; Shmuel &#8220;clarified&#8221; his remarks. And by clarified, we mean that he softened his stance significantly. The Jewsnews<strong>™</strong> sites reported that R&#8217; Shmuel certainly does not advocate banning metzitza b&#8217;peh. Rather, if a danger is established, a tube should be used. Further, no one holds that a tube is not &#8220;good enough&#8221; for metzitza b&#8217;peh.</p>
<p>Anger is being directed at the Jewish Week for misconstruing R&#8217; Shmuel&#8217;s statement. This is really silly because the two statements are entirely reconcilable. There is no reason to bash the Jewish Week for its take on R&#8217; Shmuel&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>But what is really going on here? Why do some people insist that metzitza b&#8217;peh is such an integral part of circumcision? Especially when it is clear that great rabbis have permitted the use of tube and in light of the fact that the entire point of metzitza is to promote healing as per ancient medicine? Why is this considered such a holy practice?</p>
<p>There are two answers (I think). One is reactionary, the other is ideological.</p>
<p>The reactionary approach views circumcision as a holy rite that has been mocked and banned more than several times throughout our history. The feeling is that even one step backward (really forward) from this ancient tradition places the entire thing in jeopardy. If circumcision is being attacked in any way, shape, or form, we must attack back. We fight for circumcision. Even when there is no real reason to fight.</p>
<p>I think this is a popular approach. Clearly it is based on a huge fallacy. But it is nonetheless understandable. Yet I think the real reason is the second reason.</p>
<p>The ideological approach is based on a mystical source. A 17th century kabbalist wrote that there is a kabbalistic reason for metzitza b&#8217;peh. The Talmud, which speaks of medical reasons, is trumped by the mystical source which speaks of kabbalistic reasons. The idea is that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;man possesses a foreskin because of Adam’s sin in the Garden of Eden.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The same parts of the body which caused this distortion must restore the body to its natural perfection. Adam’s hands took the forbidden fruit and his mouth ate it, so the hands of the mohel remove the foreskin and the blood is removed with the mouth. (Source: Rabbi Korobkin&#8217;s excellent article.)</em></p>
<p>I think this source is the real reason behind the entire kerkuffle. Like few other areas of Jewish law and practice, metzitza b&#8217;peh places the mystical and rationalist points of view at loggerheads.</p>
<p>According to the rationalist, the reason for metzitza b&#8217;peh is medical. There was no emphasis on using the mouth and our great rabbis are not to be blamed for their faulty science. There is no sacred meaning behind metzitza b&#8217;peh and therefore it can be pushed aside for a more modern solution that is equally acceptable in halacha. According to the mystic, the reason for metzitza b&#8217;peh is kabbalistic. Some <em>tikkun</em> is taking place when the mohel places his mouth on the circumcision wound and therefore it must be upheld at (almost) all costs. Perhaps our great rabbis of the Talmud were not speaking of some physical medicine when they said that metzitza b&#8217;peh was necessary for medical reasons, rather it is a spiritual cure for an esoteric flaw in humanity.</p>
<p>This is where we stand today. Mystics and Rationalists living under one roof. A house divided. Who will prevail? Is strength in numbers? Or is strength in reason? We will likely find out the answer to that question soon enough. In the meantime, I think it is prudent to see the sides of this battle for what they are, mysticism vs. rationalism. Again. I think.</p>

<p>I have read all these books. I wholeheartedly recommend them. I have not done full reviews of most of these books on the blog but I have included a brief description and the rationalist significance of each of these books. I hope that if you have other books to recommend you will leave your suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>The list:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4888"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583303693/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1583303693">Masterplan: Judaism&#8211;Its Program, Meaning &amp; Goals</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Carmell, this book is based on R&#8217; Hirsch&#8217;s Horeb. It gives a framework for understanding the structure of Judaism and its commandments. It does so without using a single passage from the mystical sources. It is excellent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/190411329X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=190411329X">Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation with Mysticism</a> &#8211; Written by Menachem Kellner, this book (without saying so) debunks a common claim made by contemporary orthodox Jews. The claim is that the Rambam would have been a mysticist if only he had received the Kabbalistic Tradition. This book shows that the Rambam specifically set out to forge a rationalist path of Judaism.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00876HOFI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00876HOFI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Hashgachah Pratis: An Exploration of Divine Providence</a> - Written by Rabbi Aryeh Leibowitz, this book studies the various approaches to Hashgacha Pratis. There is a maximalist view that is prevalent in orthodox Judaism today. The rationalist is more likely to find meaning in the more minimalist views of the rishonim as they are documented in this book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764239/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1906764239">The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides&#8217; Thirteen Principles Reappraised</a> &#8211; Written by Marc Shapiro, this book, in convincing fashion, describes the myriad of opinions on matters of faith. Most people assume the Rambam&#8217;s 13 Principles have universal acceptance among Jewish thinkers throughout the millennium. Shapiro demonstrates that things are not so simple. Every meaningful point in this book is made with a traditional, accepted orthodox Jewish source.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143150/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1933143150">The Challenge of Creation: Judaism&#8217;s Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book is a rationalist explanation of Cosmology. This is a particularly difficult area of Torah to navigate without mysticism. Rabbi Slifkin does an excellent job in this book. All of Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s books are excellent. This is the most crucial book for rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143185/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1933143185">Sacred Monsters: Mysterious and Mythical Creatures of Scripture, Talmud and Midrash</a> &#8211; Also written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book explains the various creatures that seem too fantastical to be real. Either they were real and magical creatures exist or they were not real and magical creatures do not exist. This book takes the latter position and explains many of these passages that have troubled rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dovbear-on-the-parsha-dov-bear/1113656036?ean=9781257153367">DovBear on the Parsha</a> &#8211; Written by DovBear, I did a review of this book here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/">Book Review | DovBear on the Parsha</a>. This is a great book that opens the reader up to a world of pshat and medrash within our mesorah that does not embrace mystical interpretations. It also shows that with a little thinking and hard work, we can all contribute to Torah.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0791408027/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0791408027">In the Shadow of History</a> &#8211; Written by Chacham Jose Faur, this is book that opens one up to a Chacham Faur&#8217;s writings. I could have chosen many of his articles and books. But I believe that this is the most thought provoking of his books and articles that I have read. It is not quite an indispensable rationalist text but Chacham Faur is indispensable so I have suggested at least one of his books in this list.</p>
<p><strong>Double Bonus</strong>: Subscribe to <a title="Visarga" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visarga">Ḥ</a><a href="http://www.hakirah.org/" target="_blank">akirah</a> and read Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s blog: <a href="%20http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/">Rationalist Judaism</a></p>
