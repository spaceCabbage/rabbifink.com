				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7250" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /></a>The war over MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is rising to a crescendo. The mouthpiece of the Ultra-Orthodox American establishment is the Yated Ne&#8217;eman. The Yated and its Matzav.com website are <a href="http://www.yated.com/dov-lipman--bad-choice-to-keynote-rca-convention.7-977-7-.html" target="_blank">leading the charge to discredit and demonize Lipman</a> in every way possible. Meanwhile, the Centrist Orthodox Americans are watching from the sidelines as they watch a potential hero go to zero. The Modern Orthodox Jewish community is becoming enraged as they see their values trudged upon by their charedi brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess.</p>
<p>Two important voices from the moderate camp have invited Lipman to speak. The RCA Convention will be headlined by Lipman and the BAYT Shul in Toronto is featuring Lipman as a Scholar in Residence the last week in June.</p>
<p>For these grievous sins, Lipman, the RCA, and BAYT have come under a severe assault of attacks from the Yated and Matzav. Articles calling for boycotts of these fine institutions, articles condemning the the decision makers and rabbinic leadership of both institutions, and of course articles enumerating the horrible sins of Lipman as ammunition for their war appear regularly in their pages.<span id="more-7249"></span></p>
<p>The thrust of their arguments against Lipman focus on isolated incidents, out of context quotes, but most of all guilt by association.</p>
<p>I think this is a very important point. There are pundits who &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; to spin conspiracy tales on a daily basis. People believe it. Others just disqualify the opinions or ideas of others because they have a second cousin who gave money to someone else who has a nephew in Al Qaeda. People seem to be okay with this too. For some, guilt by association is actual guilt. For these people, who you know and with whom you associate determine your credibility.</p>
<p>Obviously, this parlor game is ridiculous. If you search long enough you can connect any two people in the world. Guilt by association is terrible way to make a point. Assuming that the two people are associated, there is no evidence that they agree on anything. They could hate each other. Or they could agree on one thing and completely disagree on another. It&#8217;s pure scare tactics and dishonesty to impugn people because of loose ties or even strong ties that they may have with others who might be different or even dangerous.</p>
<p>The same exact thing is happening now in the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish media.</p>
<p>Lipman is in the same party as Yair Lapid? And Lapid&#8217;s father, Tommy, was virulently anti-orthodox? Lipman must also be anti-orthodox! The RCA asked Lipman to speak? The RCA must agree with everything Yair Lapid says too! BAYT invited Lipman for Shabbos? BAYT is clearly anti-Torah.</p>
<p>These are the arguments being made.</p>
<p>The non-Ultra-Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t play this game. They would prefer to hear challenging ideas and thought provoking conversation than disqualify any dissenters by way of guilt by association. Does the RCA agree with every single thing Lipman says? Probably not. No two people agree on everything! Does BAYT co-sign every single thing Lipman has ever done? Of course not. But both institutions pride themselves on appealing to a broad spectrum of orthodox Jews and care passionately about matters of great communal importance. Thus, Lipman is a great candidate for a talk in both places.</p>
<p>But the uber-charedi world it doesn&#8217;t work like that. Unless someone is 100% kosher, they can&#8217;t get to the table. No matter how salient their points may be, they don&#8217;t have the opportunity to be heard. Worse, when two people are associated, and person A says or does something controversial, everyone runs to person B and asks if person B &#8220;holds of&#8221; what person A did. It&#8217;s ridiculous! People can disagree. People can have different opinions. Why is it even expected that if person B associates with person A they would agree with everything person A does? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>This is the best way to seek and destroy any dissent or debate. There is no room for dissent or debate when as soon as someone dissents or debates all that person&#8217;s associates are impugned and they are forced to distance themselves from the dissenter or debater. Nothing could be more chilling.</p>
<p>The other way is to analyze ideas, not people. Rambam writes &#8220;Hear truth from whoever says it.&#8221; These are wise words. The source of an idea is only secondary to the content of the idea. Great people can say stupid things and stupid people can say great things. It&#8217;s terribly insecure and unwise to automatically eliminate so many voices simply because they are guilty by association.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the primary issue that is at play here. Since Lipman is straddling two worlds, he is by definition persona non grata in the Ultra-Orthodox world. One can&#8217;t be for Torah and also cavort with people who are not for Torah. Therefore he is automatically wrong and all the rules of fair play and honesty are no longer relevant. He is a threat who must be stopped. He is not a voice that must be answered. This is the only explanation for the completely disingenuous and false attacks against Lipman.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old argument within orthodox Judaism. For some time now there has been resistance against fostering debate and conversation amongst people with differing views and perspectives. Worse, it has long been established that orthodox Rabbis may not sit on organizations with non-orthodox Jews lest it be perceived as endorsement of non-orthodox values. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a great tactic, nor do I think it&#8217;s wise in the long run. Writing for Tradition Magazine, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/23256285" target="_blank">Rabbi Shubert Spero addressed this issue in 1966</a> and we can see how things have changed since then. Rabbi Spero was writing about engaging non-orthodox Jews. Engaging orthodox Jews wasn&#8217;t an issue in 1966.</p>
<p>Look where we are today. We still don&#8217;t participate with non-orthodox Jews. In fact the <a href="http://matzav.com/the-rca-and-the-women-of-the-wall" target="_blank">Yated recently addressed this very issue</a>,Â going so far as to compare Reform Jews in the mid-20th century with the Women of the Wall and MK Lipman. The Yated takes for granted that it would be prohibited to work together with Reform Jews, the additional point was that this rule would also apply to WoW and Lipman. In 1966 Rabbi Spero was hopeful that orthodox Jews could participate with non-orthodox Jews. Here we stand in 2013 and orthodox Jews cannot participate with orthodox Jews who associate with non-orthodox Jews! It seems to me we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>What will it take to change the tenor of discourse in the orthodox Jewish community? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe an Asifa. An <em>achdus</em> Asifa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7073" alt="Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237-200x300.jpeg" width="200" height="300" /></a>The Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Israel, Rabbi Aharon Feldman has apologized to MK Rabbi Dov Lipman for calling him a <em>rasha.</em> In his apology, R&#8217; Feldman says that he believes the MK Lipman is <em>&#8220;l&#8217;shem shamayim&#8221;</em> and wants what is best for the Jewish people including the charedim in Israel. Because of these revelations, R&#8217; Feldman says that MK Lipman is misguided but not a <em>rasha.</em></p>
<p>R&#8217; Feldman makes the case that MK Lipman is wrong or misguided using traditional Torah sources and accepted wisdom in the yeshiva world. He very emphatically disagrees with MK Lipman but the discourse is civil.</p>
<p>Initially, I was hurt and saddened when I read R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s original remarks. While I can&#8217;t say I am thrilled with his position on this issue, there is something positive that I can say. R&#8217; Aharon Feldman showed the charedi world what it means to be an honestÂ <em>eved Hashem.</em> It takes guts to apologize. It always takes guts. But it takes ten times more guts when you are the Rosh Yeshiva of a prominent Torah institution and the subject of your apology isÂ <em>persona non grataÂ </em>in the charedi world. It could not have been easy to apologize but it was the right thing to do and for that I admire R&#8217; Feldman.</p>
<p>Further, R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s apology and argument is so different than the other recent charedi responses and rhetoric towards MK Lipman. It was respectful and somewhat positive. Again, I don&#8217;t love R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s position on this issue. But I do appreciate how stark the difference is between the way he is handling this and the way some other charedim are handling it.<span id="more-7072"></span></p>
<p>Look, it is easy to be cynical and say that R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s speech was more of the same. But I see it differently. There was some dignity in this dispute and it was not laced with disgust and revulsion. It&#8217;s sad to say it, but that is a huge improvement and I hope that those who jumped on R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s bandwagon when he called MK Lipman a <em>rasha</em> are just as quickly jumping on his bandwagon of toning down the rhetoric.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t intend to come off as one with a bias of low expectations. Not at all. I am simply comparing what R&#8217; Feldman said and did in his apology with what I have been hearing from pseudonymous writers on frum sites and their commenters. It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air and I applaud R&#8217; Feldman for doing what was right.</p>
<p>One level deeper, it gives me hope that others can see that R&#8217; Feldman is simply trying to do what is <em>emes.</em> He is not attempting character assassination for the sake of a cause. He thinks MK Lipman is wrong and told him so. But he sounds reasonable. I think the difference stems from something he alluded to in his apology. R&#8217; Feldman said that MK Lipman is a <em>shogeig</em> and a <em>shogeig</em> isn&#8217;t a <em>rasha.</em> What he means is that he is looking at his through a lens of halacha. He is not looking at it through a lens of pure politics.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are counter arguments to R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s opinion. My point here is not to say that R&#8217; Feldman made his arguments so convincingly that the discussion is closed. Rather, the way R&#8217; Feldman spoke to MK Lipman means that there is hope the discussion is still open.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7062" alt="174928094" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a>MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is ruffling the feathers of many charedi Gedolim in Israel and America. It seems there are two levels to the rhetoric against MK Lipman.</p>
<p>Primarily, I think many have a problem with him by dint of his association with MK Yair Lapid. It is an article of faith that Lapid is anti-charedi and since MK Lipman is a member of MK Lapid&#8217;s party he is guilty by association. I don&#8217;t think it would be possible to support Yesh Atid and have charedi approval.</p>
<p>Secondarily, many have a problem with MK Lipman&#8217;s positions. I think that his positions are perceived as anti-charedi and therefore anti-Torah. In particular, supporting a requirement that save for specific instances, all charedim participate in the army or national service and join the workforce instead of a blanket exemption for all charedim from service. MK Lipman also supports requiring a basic secular education for all Israelis, no exceptions. By the way, he also supports a better Jewish education for all Israelis, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care to discuss whether charedim are truly the most authentic orthodox Jews or whether they are corrupting Judaism. That&#8217;s a discussion for another time. I want to discuss the reaction of American charedim to MK Lipman&#8217;s proposals.<span id="more-7060"></span></p>
<p>In Israel, a charedi is identified by several social and religious markers. I list them here in no particular order, nor is this list exhaustive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Manner of dress. Charedim wear black and white, sport felt or fur hats, and shun modern style of dress like jeans or T-shirts.</li>
<li>Fear of God. Charedim place God and religion above all else. The word of God is supreme.</li>
<li>Daas Torah. Charedim extend their fealty to the word of God beyond the words of the Written Torah, and even beyond the Oral Law, to include the words of the great rabbis and treat their words like the word of God.</li>
<li>Torah learning is the ultimate service of God. Working for a living is not ideal at best and is actively avoided at worst.</li>
<li>No secular education. Charedim send their children to private schools which do not teach anything that is not found in the Torah.</li>
<li>Rejection of Zionism. The State of Israel is not recognized as a positive development for the Jewish people. It is more likely described as a problem than a solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is your Israeli Charedi checklist.</p>
<p>However in America, people who consider themselves charedi use a different set of parameters.</p>
<p>I think that American charedim subscribe to 1-3, but not necessarily 4-6. The only people in America who truly hold of 4-6 would be chasidim and not all chasidim would agree with 4-6 either. Certainly, many chasidim do not agree with #4 and in America even the chasidic communities are required to give a basic (not sufficient) secular education.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter?</p>
<p>It seems to me, that American charedim are more similar to MK Lipman than they are to Israeli charedim. It is conceivable that MK Lipman could word his platform a little bit differently and still mean the exact same thing. He could say &#8220;I want Israeli charedim to be like American charedim&#8221; and the practical ramifications would be strikingly similar.</p>
<p>I think MK Lipman would be thrilled if Israeli charedim were like Lakewood charedim. They get a secular education, they work (eventually), they even support the State of Israel to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Yet, American gedolim and charedim in America continue to malign MK Lipman and his platform. I don&#8217;t get it. All he is saying is that Israeli charedim should be more like American charedim! He wants them to be like us! They should be flattered. Not insulted!</p>
<p>R&#8217; Ahron Feldman is a Rosh Yeshiva of a yeshiva that is precisely what MK Lipman wants for Israeli charedim and yet he severely criticizes MK Lipman going so far as to call him a rasha. It doesn&#8217;t add up. If what we have in America is good why is it not good for our brothers and sisters in Israel? And even if what they have could be conceived of as better, it&#8217;s not so terrible to be like the American charedim, is it?</p>
<p>True, the two groups share one name &#8211; Charedim. But they are different types of charedim!</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is complicated. Army service can be difficult for charedim. We can understand the reluctance to become less insular and take time away from Torah study. These are reasonable critiques of the sweeping proposals being discussed right now. But let&#8217;s be reasonable. We can talk about the issues and figure out the best way to deal with them.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that there are some potential problems with MK Lipman&#8217;s plan. It&#8217;s not easy to just throw away the old system. There are going to be complications. But I think we will be far more successful if we work together. The plan is not to turn charedim into secular Zi0nists. How about just acting more like American charedim? Seems to me that it should be a workable solution.</p>
