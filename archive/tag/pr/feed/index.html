				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/reality-tv-illustration.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7057" alt="reality-tv-illustration" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/reality-tv-illustration-300x240.gif" width="300" height="240" /></a>You may have noticed that I didn&#8217;t post anything new on the blog over the last few days. This was because I was very busy filming for a TV show that will be airing in the summer. It was exhausting and I simply could not get my mind in the right mode for writing.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say much about the show or give away too many details. But I will say that the show is a reality style show and our shul is being featured in one full one hour episode. I have no idea if the show will be any good, but it certainly has potential.</p>
<p>The most important thing I learned from this week was that Reality TV is anything but reality. What they mean is that there are no actors and there is no script. So the producers will tell you what they want and it is your job to give it to them. In other words, most of the conflict you see on these programs is manufactured for the show. Don&#8217;t believe any of the drama you see. The shows are typically interesting enough without the drama, but for some reason everyone expects drama so the show creates it.</p>
<p>It was very hard work being on camera for hours on end. However there was a very tangible payoff to my involvement in the show and the shul benefited very much as well.</p>
<p>I look forward to the broadcast of the episode and I hope we can do some online watch party so that I can give you behind the scenes insight during the show. Hopefully, I can get my act together and blogging will resume.</p>

His name is Mattes Weingast and he hosts a Jewish radio program in New York. He wanted to organize a siyum on Brachos on the air, and he wanted me to participate.</p>
<p>I agreed to make an appearance despite the fact that the program was airing live at 5:30 AM in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>So I dragged myself out of bed at 5 AM to do the interview and make the siyum. It was a lot of fun and I don&#8217;t if anyone besides my parents were listening. But at least they got to hear it live.</p>
<p>We had a great time shmoozing and I really enjoyed being part of the festivities.</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can hear the segment by following this link:Â <a href="http://www.nachumsegal.com/UploadedImages/stdImage/JM%20Sunday%2010%2021%2012%20v1.mp3">JM Sunday</a></p>
<p>The entire program is lovely, but if you want to hear me scrub to the 1:33 mark.</p>
<p><em>Incidentally, we had a private off the record discussion in place of the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/category/rambam-2/">Rambam Class</a> this week. Hopefully next week will be a normal recorded class.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The MTA has approved a pretty powerful anti-Cordoba Center ad.</p>
<p>Here is the ad:</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Controversial-Ground-Zero-Mosque-Ads.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2708" title="Controversial-Ground-Zero-Mosque-Ads" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Controversial-Ground-Zero-Mosque-Ads.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="137" /></a></p>
<p>I find the ad obscene. It is provocative, misleading and presumptuous all in one.</p>
<p>However, as much as the ICC has a right to exist, this ad has a right to exist as well. The same laws that protect the ICC, protect this obscene ad. (Note: If the ad was so incendiary as to cause violence it would NOT be protected by the constitution, in which case it would lose my meaningless approval as well)</p>
<p>The irony is that the folks behind the ad can hide behind the 1st Amendment but would deny the same rights to the Cordoba Center.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/departures.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2505" title="departures" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/departures.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="94" /></a>Back in November I wrote about our local PBS station, KCET, coming to visit us one morning to be part of their Departures Online Series. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/06/kcet-visits-pjc-and-interviews-me/">KCET Visits PJC and Interviews Me</a>). At the time, we were told that the project would be online in March or April. Not hearing from the producers since the interview I had a feeling that the project was dead.</p>
<p>I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I was treated to an email from producer Justin Cram that the Web Series was online and we were part of it!<span id="more-2502"></span></p>
<p>This is the second time we have been featured in a wonderful online video project. Just a few weeks ago we were featured on MSNBC.com. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/19/pacific-jewish-center-featured-on-msnbc-com/">Pacific Jewish Center Featured on MSNBC.com</a>)</p>
<p>The Departures project is massive. Departures is a journey around Los Angeles and into the heart and soul of the City. You could spend hours, perhaps days, discovering more and more about local Los Angeles. The series features stunning photography, interactive murals, video and a wealth of first hand information.</p>
<p>I am amazed at the quality of Departures and really recommend checking out the section on Pacific Jewish Center as well as the hundreds of other stories.</p>
<p>KCET came to visit us at morning services. I am photographed wearing my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallit" target="_blank">tallis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin" target="_blank">tefilin</a> (phylacteries), no, it is not a mohawk.</p>
<p>Gary Dalin was interviewed about the history of our Shul and he gets 3 segments and I get 2 segments. Please watch below.</p>
