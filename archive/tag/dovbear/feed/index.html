				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/15246_4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7068" alt="15246_4" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/15246_4.jpg?resize=300%2C232" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This week I was in filming my father&#8217;s school in Monsey, Ateres Bais Yaakov, for their annual dinner. I always swell with pride as I get an intimate look at this incredible school. It is remarkable how much the students love their school, their teachers, Torah, and learning.</p>
<p>One of the highlights for me is always observing (and filming) a high school Chumash class. At Ateres, the girls are challenged to actively participate in their learning and ask questions during class.</p>
<p>In particular, Chumash is not so much taught, as it is learned. The students rigorously and precisely translate the words of the text, analyze the text for grammatical or other anomalies, and compile a list of questions for each verse. Only once that task is complete does the teacher begin to introduce the commentaries and interpretations of the great medieval commentators.</p>
<p>In this way, the various ways of learning the verse are not simply abstract interpretive choices made by great Torah scholars, rather they are solutions to problems in the text which give way to novel and illuminating interpretations. This is how the Rishonim learned Chumash. They were masters of diction and grammar. When they read a verse, they knew if the verse was rendered perfectly or if it needed interpretation. They knew all of this because, of course, they were experts in Biblical language and grammar. That expertise formed the basis for all their interpretations.</p>
<p><span id="more-7067"></span></p>
<p>i think it is great that young women are learning Chumash in the same manner as our rishonim. It was also really enjoyable to be a fly on the wall for a class like this and that is what got me thinking.</p>
<p>In my yeshiva high school we were responsible to learn the parsha every week and we were tested on Chumash with Rashi every Sunday. This way we all became familiar with the storyline and mitzvos in the Torah while also learning the most well known commentary. To me, it was a way to learn information. What does the Torah say and what does that mean? But we learned no skills (unless zipping through the Birnbaum Chumash with Rashi in English in 30 minutes and scoring a 95 on the test is a skill) and we did not get an appreciation for why Rashi chose the interpretations in his commentary. Nor were we acutely aware that there are many other equally valid interpretations on each verse in the Chumash. Certainly we had no ability to explain why each commentary chose its interpretation over the other.</p>
<p>Yet, at least in this high school, the girls are learning all of that. I mentioned this to R&#8217; Gil Student at our little <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101527642993025" target="_blank">Asifa</a> in Manhattan and he told me that he learned Chumash the way the Bais Yaakov girls learn Chumash in his left wing modern orthodox high school. (He also said that half his classmates are not orthodox today.) I can&#8217;t speak for modern orthodox high schools. But I can speak for yeshivos. The most rigorous Chumash curriculum mirrors my experience. Unfortunately, I think most yeshivos have far less Chumash learning that what I experienced.</p>
<p>I think we need to work on this. I think that we have a lot to gain by teaching Chumash the way <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/" target="_blank">Dov Bear</a> and <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com" target="_blank">R&#8217; Josh Waxman</a> approach Chumash. We need to cultivate the skills necessary and an appreciation for true Chumash study.</p>
<p>Learning Chumash the way our ancestors learned Chumash requires a working knowledge of grammar, an open forum to ask questions, and a little bit of reprogramming about our Mesorah. Those are all good things. As a side benefit I think this will help us meet some of the challenges presented by modern scholarship.</p>
<p>At the very least, every kollel guy should have a seder with his wife where she teaches him Chumash the way she learned it.</p>

<p>Unless you live under a rock, you know that El Al made a big mistake and allowed people to buy round trip tickets to Tel Aviv from New York for under $400. This was not a promotion or a sale. It was a mistake.</p>
<p>When the mistake was corrected the fares disappeared.</p>
<p><a href="https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/580772_460150634007087_1221347527_n.jpg" target="_blank">El Al is honoring the tickets.</a></p>
<p>If you scored some of these tickets what is the proper thing to do?</p>
<p>In Moment Magazine, the Ethicist Emeritus, Randy Cohen, weighs in and says:<span id="more-6131"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>El Al should offer to honor all those tickets, and the customers should decline the offer.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>El Al, like other companies, has a duty to honor the advertised price. If it is a third party mistake, then El Al should seek compensation from that third party that actually made the error&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>However, even if El Al offers to make good on the tickets, we are not supposed to exploit someone.</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It may be a very bitter pill to swallow if you &#8220;lucked out&#8221; but your luck actually is causing someone else&#8217;s loss. While it is true that the loss is self inflicted by their mistake, that does not give one the right to take advantage of someone else. (Corporations are people too?)</p>
<p>I am fond of repeating what my rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Tendler said about decided whether a business deal was ethical or not. He said the deciding factor should be the answer to the question &#8220;would I do this deal to my brother?&#8221; If the answer is no, you shouldn&#8217;t do the deal with someone else.</p>
<p>If my brother accidentally advertised a product worth $1000 for $400 I would alert him to his error. I wouldn&#8217;t exploit his error.</p>
<p>Now this may be a lofty, unrealistic ideal. I admit as much. But I am only writing what I believe is the &#8220;right thing to do&#8221; not the &#8220;easy or acceptable thing to do&#8221;. Also, we are talking about a trip to the Holy Land here. Wouldn&#8217;t you want to visit Israel with a clear and clean conscience? I would.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in &#8220;finders keepers&#8221;. I believe in doing the right thing. I think the right thing to do here is for El Al to honor the tickets. It was their mistake. But people who got the tickets should ask El Al for their money back. If El Al is feeling generous, it might the nice if they would offer some incentive for not using the tickets, like elite status or free upgrades, or something like that.</p>
<p>Think about the Kiddush Hashem that would be created if we all agreed not to use the tickets. That has to be worth at least as much as a trip to Israel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/spartan-warriors-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5664" title="spartan-warriors-2" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/spartan-warriors-2.jpg?resize=300%2C204" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This weekend, Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel granted Mishpacha Magazine an interview. I presume that when a orthodox Jewish publication interviews an orthodox Jewish public figure, the idea is to give the public figure an opportunity to set the record straight on any ambiguous issues and paint the public figure in a positive light. This is what makes this interview so odd. It didn&#8217;t quite work out that way.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zwiebel briefly addressed what has become a cornerstone issue for most sane people, sex abuse in the orthodox Jewish community. The expressly stated position of the Agudath Israel of America on this matter was ostensibly formed by the Moetzes Gedolei Yisroel. These Torah giants have determined that an orthodox Jew who is told about abuse should speak with a rabbi who in turn will advise them if they should proceed to the police. There is no central list of qualified rabbis to address this hairy question. Unluckily, Rabbi Zwiebel is constantly in the extremely difficult position of defending this position.</p>
<p>Invariably, Rabbi Zwiebel changes the discussion from the policy to the bloggers, or the falsely accused, or the assault of Daas Torah to deflect the criticism. It&#8217;s a poor strategy and it is not working. A couple weeks ago, an Agudah employee asked his Twitter followers and Facebook friends, I fit both categories, what Agudah could do to change the negative public perception about their abuse policy. I responded that they should change the policy. They haven&#8217;t. The point is that Agudah is aware of the public backlash.</p>
<p>The Mishpacha interview was more of the same and it spawned two very strident posts by my two favorite bloggers, <a href="http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2012/06/agudah-acknowledges-dropping-ball-on.html" target="_blank">Rabbi Slifkin</a> and <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2012/06/zweibel-paraphrased-better-thousand.html" target="_blank">DovBear</a>.<span id="more-5663"></span> When strident posts like theirs are written, the apologists take to the airwaves. In their best attempt to mete out measure for measure, the apologists counter attack. They call those who dare question the authority of the great rabbis heretics, rabble-rousers, angry, no longer orthodox, and a litany of other offenses.</p>
<p>What strikes me is that the apologists often wind up championing positions or ideas that those they are defending would not agree with. In other words, the rabbis these people are defending tooth and nail don&#8217;t necessarily agree with their world wide web warriors.</p>
<p>I can attest to this. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/27/why-is-the-internet-asifa-at-citifield-for-men-only/" target="_blank">When I questioned the folly of disallowing women from attending the Asifa</a>, I was called all kinds of names. But the truth was that the rabbis who these name callers were defending actually agreed with my position. They wanted the women to attend. I can&#8217;t be a jerk or kofer for suggesting the very thing that the rabbis wanted. When I questioned the wisdom of a one-size-fits-all Internet solution I was lambasted. I subsequently discovered that several Gedolim agreed with that position as well. How can I be a horrible person for agreeing with some of the Gedolim?</p>
<p>I think a little of the same thing happens when people attack Rabbi Slifkin and DovBear. The apologists take more hardline positions than those who they are defending. They invoke crazy <em>svaros</em> and obscure statements from earlier rabbis, that the ones whom they are defending would never use. Their positions are always more nuanced than their apologists. The other side of the same coin is that the dissenters oftentimes understand the position they take issue with as more extreme than it was intended.</p>
<p>Apologists come in many shapes and forms representing many ideologies and positions. In politics I see the same thing. Politicians from either side of the aisle are much more willing to compromise than their constituents. It&#8217;s easy to be an extremist fundamentalist when you have no responsibility or consequences to your actions. But when the fate of others rests in your hands, and you are a good person, you are going to consider more than your most fundamentalist position. Public policy, whether it is religious or political is usually a combination of compromises. There are no true socialists and no true capitalists in government. They realize that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I think the apologists for the Gedolim need to take a deep breath and realize that the American Gedolim generally do not choose extremist positions. Similarly, most of the educators in our schools are not as extreme or unreasonable as the <em>parents</em> of the children in their schools. We cannot  allow the apologists and extremists to hijack or become the leaders of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>That being said, on the issue of abuse, the time has come for the Gedolim to really learn and appreciate what happens to victims of abuse. I honestly do not think they understand the gravity of the situation and perhaps if we educated them, their policy could change. If you would like to assist me or direct me in how to do this, please be in touch.</p>
<p>And for the record, my charedi poskim do not agree with the position of the Moetzes and they recommend going to the authorities.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was alerted to a very interesting article in the NY Times that provided some really good food for thought. The article sets its launching point at an ornithological discovery in 2005. A thought to extinct bird was spotted and the evidence was uploaded to the Internet.</p>
<p>It seems that although there was enough evidence for the journal Science, thousands of bird enthusiasts dissected the evidence and have conclusively shown the discovery to have been a hoax (or mistake).</p>
<p>This kind of thing happens all the time. And it&#8217;s been happening for a long time.</p>
<p>Going back to the earliest days of writing, readers would comment, redact, correct, disagree, argue, and question what they were reading by writing notes in the margins or writing glosses or writing something to counter what they had just read. Later, readers of both the original and the subsequent writings would sometimes collect them and publish them together. Sometimes they would fix the errors, other times they would just add the notes of others.</p>
<p>In fact, this is precisely how the Mishna and Talmud were composed.<span id="more-5635"></span> The Mishna is made up of short snippets of Jewish law that were culled from the notes of prior scholars. The compiler, Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi, combined earlier opinions with later opinions and used his judgment to produce the best result for the future of Judaism. The Talmud then records hundreds of years of conversations and annotations on the Mishna. Ravina and Rav Ashi made the final choices about which comments, arguments, proofs, anecdotes, discussions, and clarifications to include.</p>
<p>To a lesser degree the same thing happened with the Midrash, as the author of the NY Times article notes. Throughout Jewish history, scholars have been using this method to develop Jewish law and thought. This is the way many of the Rishonim and Achronim made their way into our daily lives. Rashi on Chumash is a great example of this. He took his favorite interpretations that he found in prior works and now they are found as part of his commentary in almost every Chumash printed. The many commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch follow the same pattern. They had notes in the margins of their copies of the Shulchan Aruch and later printers wished to include them in their new versions of the Shulchan Aruch and now the Shach and Taz are household names.</p>
<p>The NY Times article argues that the Internet creates the same kind of writer to commenter interface. The writer says something. The reader has something to say in return and the result is sometimes beautiful discussion, and other times flamewar. Either way, much of the value in today&#8217;s writing is not found in the original article, it is found in the comments section. Or in the Facebook comments, or the Tweets, or the Reddit threads. Wherever it is found, the readers&#8217; contributions often have a lot of value.</p>
<p>Some bloggers, like <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a>, consistently tout the excellence of the comments on their blog. I tend to agree. DovBear has had some amazing commenters. The posts on this blog don&#8217;t usually generate as robust conversations as the posts on his blog, but when there are good conversations here, the comments become the stars of the show and the posts become basic material for discussion. <em>(Parenthetically, DovBear&#8217;s blog comments from over 7000 posts are on the verge of being lost forever. A tragedy if I ever heard one&#8230;)</em></p>
<p>In the tradition of the redactors and later publishers of the great works of history that integrated the original writings with subsequent comments, the author of the NY Times article suggests that the Internet needs a redactor. The best comments and opinions that follow the original articles need to highlighted somehow, even integrated into the posts. The give and take of the comment thread produces excellent material and oftentimes helps the group come to a better truth. It would be such a shame if all that wisdom was lost in the black hole of cyberspace.</p>
<p>But the real powerful point of the article is that experts and non-experts have an equal voice in the comments. And the crowd has a unique ability to ferret out lies, fools, and fallacies. If we all take our commenting duties seriously, we can help the greater community arrive at truths that may have been otherwise missed, either intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p>When it comes to discourse on religion, clearly there are some ground rules upon which we all need to agree in order to facilitate positive discussion. But when the rules are agreed upon and the discussion is vociferous, yet civil, we can benefit from coming closer to a truth. That is just another of the incredibly powerful uses of the Internet for the orthodox Jew. If we ban it, we lose that opportunity. I don&#8217;t think that it is a stretch to say that the Internet might exist simply for us to make the most of that opportunity and make the future of orthodox Judaism as viable and vibrant as it must be for our children and grandchildren.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Van_Gogh_Starry_Night.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4537" title="Van_Gogh_Starry_Night" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Van_Gogh_Starry_Night.jpg?resize=300%2C246" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It has been a while since my last Malcolm Gladwell post. That streak ends today.</p>
<p>On Grantland.com, Gladwell is critical of the owners of NBA teams. Currently, the NBA owners have locked out the NBA players. The collective bargaining agreement expired and the owners want a better deal this time around. Small market owners are claiming that they are losing money. They want to cut costs. The players have not assented to the terms of the owners, namely, lower salaries so that the owners can make more money.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the owners seem to be taking out frustration with each other on the players. If they want to pay the players less money they should simply pay the players less money. The exorbitant salaries for players who are being overpaid are not the fault of the players. They are the fault of foolish owners and bad management.</p>
<p>Further, there is an easier solution for NBA owners to make more money. Revenue sharing. That is how it is done in other sports. The NBA should follow suit and create a more equitable revenue sharing model.</p>
<p>Gladwell however, believes that the owners entire premise is wrong.<span id="more-4534"></span> His opinion is that NBA owners have no right to demand that their teams make money. The reason someone buys an NBA team is not to make money. Billionaires buy teams to satisfy a different need; not financial gain. This is called a &#8220;psychic benefit&#8221;. Gladwell compares it to owning a Van Gogh. One does not buy a Van Gogh as an investment. One buys a Van Gogh simply to have the Van Gogh. If the painting does not increase in value, that is not really a concern. After all, you have the Van Gogh.</p>
<p>The argument is compelling and he might be correct. Gladwell is basically saying that NBA owners have no right invoking economic principles when discussing their costs and profits. They did not buy the team as an investment so they can&#8217;t complain when their non-investment is not turning a profit.</p>
<p>Reading the article and thinking about the argument reminded me of a guest post on DovBear from last year. The guest poster is an administrator at a Yeshiva and he expressed displeasure with another guest poster complaining about tuition costs. Further, he expressed frustration with parents who don&#8217;t pay their bills as per their tuition contracts and prioritize their spending by placing education near the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>A serious, sometimes passionate discussion ensued in the comments. Perhaps the most salient point of all was made by DovBear: (And I paraphrase) &#8220;A school should be treated like a business and if it cannot run efficiently then it should not run at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think Malcolm Gladwell would disagree. Not everything that looks like a business is a business. An NBA team is only somewhat like a business. But it is more like a Van Gogh. You cannot apply standard rules of economics to NBA teams. Yeshivos also look like businesses, but I think Gladwell&#8217;s point about NBA teams can be applied similarly to our yeshivos.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t open schools to make money. They are not an investment. The standard rules of economics cannot be applied to yeshivos.</p>
<p>Yeshivos are opened for to serve the community. They are opened simply so that there are yeshivos for our children to attend.</p>
<p>I think it might be unfair to try to apply the common rules of economics to our schools. They do need to be run efficiently. They do need to be able to stay afloat. But above all, they need to stay open so that our children get the education that they need.</p>
<p>Certainly, we can demand excellence and we can demand responsible spending of communal funds. But I don&#8217;t think we can demand that our schools run like an investment firm, supermarket, hospital or coffee shop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of our yeshivos are not (yet) &#8220;Van Goghs&#8221;, but practically speaking, they really are.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no scholar of ancient texts. But there are scholars of ancient texts. A large group of them has been studying the evolution of the text of the Tanach (the Jewish version of the Old Testament) for 53 years.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the text we have today has remained virtually unchanged since the 11th century. It was then that Maimonides used the Aleppo Codex to codify a version of the Torah scroll. That version is almost exactly what we have today.</p>
<p>But notice, I used the word &#8220;almost&#8221;. That&#8217;s because it is not exactly the same. Or it might not be exact. There are several nuances that differentiate the standard Torah scroll used in the majority of Jewish communities from the Yemenite Torah text tradition. They can&#8217;t both be exactly the same as the text codified by Maimonides.<span id="more-4518"></span></p>
<p>Certainly the Talmud seems to indicate that they had a different version. The Talmud in Kiddushin gives specific places as the middle of the text and the number of words and letters. None of those are consistent with our text. In several places various rishonim (Medieval commentators) indicate that there were small differences between the Torah scrolls among their peers. Other rishonim stated that the text was deliberately changed by later prophets in certain instances. They were permitted to do so as long as none of the Torah&#8217;s laws were affected by their changes.</p>
<p>None of the differences that have been recorded are significant enough to change the law. None of the discrepancies have an effect of the theology or religion of the Torah. Yet, there has emerged a &#8220;sacred belief&#8221; that the Torah remains unchanged over the 3000 years since the Revelation at Sinai.</p>
<p>This is quite obviously impossible.</p>
<p>A massive project in Israel is charting all the extant versions of the text and their collective history. They are using every possible version and manuscript to show any and all minor differences between each version. The Aleppo Codex is the starting point for the project and all differences are being compared to that version.</p>
<p>And there are differences. It is impossible to pretend otherwise. But this should not be a problem for believers in orthodox Judaism. There are several acceptable approaches to the issues raised by the variations in the text. Each approach appeals to different styles within orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>1) Hashgacha pratis. God runs the world. Whatever changes that have evolved are part of a grand Master Plan.</p>
<p>2) Lo bashamayim hi. &#8220;The Torah is not in the Heavens&#8221;. Once the Torah was given to Man, it was understood that there would be mistakes. We do our best to avoid mistakes, but errors are inevitable and it cannot be legitimately stated that our version is perfect.</p>
<p>3) Torah She&#8217;Baal Peh is primary. The truth is that we do not live our lives as orthodox Jews based on the Written Law as much as we lived based on its interpretation in the Oral Law. Mistakes in the Written Law have no real bearing on a Jewish life based on the Oral Law.</p>
<p>Certainly each of these positions is more nuanced and broad than the one or two sentence headlines mentioned here. The point is that approaches exist and we should not be afraid of them.</p>
<p>What about the 8th principle of faith according to the Rambam?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Sanhedrin.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4508" title="Sanhedrin" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Sanhedrin.jpg?resize=300%2C270" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Today&#8217;s New York Times presents a fascinating argument made by Dr. Schnall from YU.</p>
<p>Schnall argues that the ancient Jewish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin" target="_blank">Sanhedrin</a> built into its system a foil to the fatal flaws of &#8220;groupthink&#8221;. Groupthink explains how otherwise very intelligent people can make terrible decisions as a group. Often, members of a group defer to others and they lose their voice even when they might disagree with the majority or group leaders. Without voices of dissent, even groups can make disastrous decisions.</p>
<p>The Sanhedrin had rules that forced the group out of groupthink. First and foremost, any unanimous decision regarding a capital case was discarded. Other minor rules also did their part. For example, junior members spoke first so that their opinions would original and not be influenced by the elders. Dr. Schnall cites many other examples from the Sanhedrin&#8217;s rules that he claims are helpful in avoiding groupthink.<span id="more-4507"></span></p>
<p>On the Times website they leave this question hanging for their readers:</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think? </strong>Is a unanimous decision a sign of a slam dunk or overwhelming groupthink?</em></p>
<p>While I find that question interesting, I am more interested in whether our current Daas Torah style of rabbinic leadership might be suffering from some sort of groupthink? <span style="font-size: x-small;">(Yes, this might offensive to people who believe that rabbis are not human and do not ever make mistakes but per my tradition from my rabbis and teachers this is a perfectly acceptable position, thankyouverymuch.)</span> I wonder, is there dissent in the Moetzes? Do the rabbis disagree with one another? Or do they all defer to the leadership? Much in the same way that those who live and breathe by every word uttered from their mouths? Is it possible that they disagree in private and present a united front in their public statements? Yes. But wouldn&#8217;t we all feel more confident if we knew that for certain?</p>
<p>I know it is a cop out to ask open-ended questions on a blog and not answer them (ahem, NY Times Arts Beat). But in this case, I just don&#8217;t know. I have my suspicions but I have no way to confirm them. It is, however, worthwhile food for thought.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/6-Suffragist-Picketing4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4349" title="6 Suffragist Picketing(4)" alt="" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/6-Suffragist-Picketing4.jpg?resize=300%2C288" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I am a big fan of Hakirah, a really nicely done Torah journal. I was turned onto the publication by a friend of mine who was published in the journal and am now a subscriber.</p>
<p>The most recent Hakirah attempted to begin to tackle the issue of women in the rabbinate. It began with a short article from <strong>Rabbi Herschel Schachter</strong> who did not do the subject justice but concluded, based on the laws of <em>tznius</em>, that a position such as Rabbi is not a preferable place for men or women due to its very public nature. However in choosing who should perform the public duties of a Rabbi, it is better to have men in a position of non-tznius than women.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s article is interesting but too short. It leaves way too much wiggle room and seems to be referring mostly to women pulpit rabbis.</p>
<p>The next article does a much more comprehensive job of dealing with the issue. Its authors are <strong>Rabbi Michael Broyde</strong> and <strong>Rabbi Shlomo Brody</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first broached this topic on this blog I did so in the context of social change. (PLEASE READ: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/23/patience-is-a-virtue-and-an-important-ingredient-for-change/">Patience Is A Virtue and An Important Ingredient For Change</a>) My premise is that all social change happens slowly. Change that is too quick or premature can backfire. I predicted that women would continue to see more prominent roles in areas of religious leadership over time.</p>
<p>My good friend <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a> vehemently disagreed with this wait and see approach. <span id="more-4344"></span>In his mind an injustice cannot be tolerated at all. Since he feels that the current situation for women in orthodox Judaism is an injustice, patience is a curse, not a cure. Now DovBear is entitled to shriek from the rooftops but that doesn&#8217;t mean anything will change. Personally, I am concerned with real change not just proclamations.</p>
<p>I view the issue primarily as a social one, not a <em>halachic</em> one. The reason for this is that I believe that the law will adapt to the social environment. However this is only possible if there is a halachic mechanism to give women a more prominent role in religious leadership. It has been demonsrated by Rabbis Broyde and Brody that it can. Certainly it can also be prohibited by law if one makes certain halachic decisions. But it would be equally halachically acceptable to adapt what is currently halachically acceptable. One major factor the Rabbis cite, is the public needs, desires and perception.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend reading the full article. I have uploaded an annotated version of the article with specific key points underlined. Read that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Vol-11-Broyde.pdf" target="_blank">Hakirah Vol 11</a>.</p>
<p>My summary of the women in religious leadership roles in orthodox Judaism is as follows:</p>
<p>Many women in the Bible are heroes. They frequently possess keener insight than their male counterparts. Sometimes they are stronger than the men. Other times they play a secondary role, but star anyway. <em>Midrashim</em> also speak highly of women. In the law, women are afforded much more liberty and equality than in other ancient legal systems. In ancient times, the Torah was a progressive woman&#8217;s best hope. There is no indication in the Torah that women could not and should not be able to achieve the same level of scholarship or religious leadership as men. The one example where women are severely limited is in becoming king or by extension any other position of <em>serara.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Talmud</em> has several statements that seem to disparage women. The most classic example is the oft repeated prohibition against teaching women Torah. The Talmud explains this statement by one <em>Tanna</em> in a <em>Mishna</em> with the statement &#8220;<em>Nashim daatam kalos</em>&#8220;. Which literally translated means that women are weak-minded and since that is the case, it is futile to teach them Torah. The Rambam codifies this into halacha.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, for the bulk of the last 2000 years since the beginning of the Mishnaic period the sentiment that women are inferior has been accepted as fact. It is plain as day to see this fact when considering the great lengths women had to go in order to get equal rights in the greatest democracy in the world. Even as few as 103 years ago, the Supreme Court has no problem publishing an opinion based on the fact that women were primarily vehicles of reproductivity and must be protected from working too many hours lest we harm their reproductive prowess. As per the summary on Oyez.org &#8220;Brewer&#8217;s opinion conveyed the accepted wisdom of the day: that women were unequal and inferior to men.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1901-1939/1907/1907_107" target="_blank">Muller v. Oregon</a>).</p>
<p>2000 years ago it was a given. Women are inferior. It took thousands of years for the secular world to escape that mentality.</p>
<p>I am aware of the mental gymnastics and apologetics to excuse or &#8220;explain&#8221; what the Talmud meant. To me, they are useless. In a world where women have every opportunity that men have, women are choosing to accomplish things their grandmothers could never have dreamed. Orthodox Jewish women expect and should expect to have similar opportunities within their religion. AH! But it wasn&#8217;t ever this way! We ALWAYS did it the old way! How can we break from Tradition? Worse, are we violating halacha?!</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is no shame in admitting the mistakes of our past. The rabbis in the Talmud were entirely justified in using the feelings and temperament of their era in applying them to Torah and Law. I don&#8217;t believe that we are bound to maintain their opinions of women or anyone. Certainly they were wise and certainly they did the best they could to serve Hashem and teach us for posterity how to do the same. But they were people and people are subject to the notions and vicissitudes of their time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>[I have been accused of being a &#8220;Conservative Rabbi&#8221; and a &#8220;fraud&#8221; for holding this position. I don&#8217;t believe this is a fair criticism. As per the Rambam, the variety of opinions on matters such as these are not part of the Oral Law passed down from Sinai to Moses and beyond. Thus, acknowledging that the rabbis of the Mishna and Talmud were able to formulate their own opinions and were not merely transmitting previously known information that was received at Sinai is not any more the attitude of a &#8220;Conservative Rabbinics&#8221; than it is the attitude of the Rambam.] </em></span></p>
<p>There is no shame in recognizing that the social environment and scientific data have changed our opinion of what women are capable of accomplishing. It would be foolish to assume that women are able to function at the highest levels of academia, science, politics, or any non-physical activity but would be unable to achieve great accomplishments in Torah and religious leadership. Indeed, they can.</p>
<p>The question is &#8220;may they?&#8221;.</p>
<p>To this question Rabbis Broyde and Brody answer a resounding&#8230; &#8220;Possibly&#8221;. But a key to their analysis is public acceptance of change in attitude towards women&#8217;s ever increasing role in orthodox Jewish religious life.</p>
<p>A century ago women had far fewer opportunities than they do today. As I wrote previously, the fact that women can study Torah in schools and places of higher learning and maintain positions of authority in Torah institutions is certainly a great innovation of the last 100 years. It is not to be taken lightly or for granted. The wisdom of our rabbis in allowing this change must be noted. The point is that women are on a track and the track is leading to a place of even greater opportunity for women. The only remaining question is how long it will take to get there.</p>
<p>When the public demands it, it will happen. When it becomes necessary it will happen. When the only obvious choice is to take that train to the next station, it will happen.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am not condoning the recent ordination of orthodox Jewish women as Rabbis (or Rabbas, or whatever). Nor am I proposing that within a few decades women will be taking positions as pulpit rabbis and Roshei Yeshiva. I am saying that there will be more opportunities for scholarship at least on par with the opportunities men have to study Torah vigorously. Correspondingly, there will be a need for women leaders and educators who have demonstrated mastery over their studies. Today, women are chosen as teachers and educators and yet, generally, compared with a mediocre yeshiva student they are ignoramuses. Creating greater opportunities for higher learning will change that. Women who are so inclined will able to receive recognition for scholarship and Torah knowledge. Our children will benefit from better school teachers. Our synagogues will benefit from better Torah classes given by women.</p>
<p>All this being said, it remains a choice for each woman or family to decide. Every family is different and some women may be happy or happier with more traditional roles. But those roles will be borne out of a choice as opposed to lack of choice. It will help women who make either choice, or if they can somehow choose both better Jews and better mother, each in their own way.</p>
<p>What should we do in the meantime? Rabbis Broyde and Brody said it best:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Women should sit and study for increasingly long periods of time, write serious scholarship in Torah, develop as inspiring spiritual personas, and lead Torah institutions, in function if not in form. In short, they should build the Orthodox community brick by brick, and see what happens over time.</em></p>
<p>So to summarize my summary:</p>
<p><em>Women used to be thought of as inferior. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with admitting that. But now we know they aren&#8217;t. They may have different roles. That should not preclude them from scholarship and recognition as Torah scholars and leaders. Eventually it won&#8217;t. Meanwhile, become scholars as best you can. This is all reconcilable with halacha. Of course it is.</em></p>

Part 1: </em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/"><em>Thoughts on Kiryas Joel: The Poorest City in America</em></a><em> and Part 2: </em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/01/attempted-murder-in-new-square-an-analysis/"><em>Attempted Murder in New Square: An Analysis</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>There is a certain common sentiment amongst many minorities and ethnicities. It is commonly expressed as &#8220;bringing shame to the family&#8221;. Or sometimes it emerges as a threat &#8220;what will the neighbors think&#8221;. Once in a while you will hear something about the &#8220;family name&#8221;.</p>
<p>These are normal, and by normal I mean occuring fairly regularly, among minorities. These stereotypes are played on incessantly in Hollywood movies and television programs and they make for good entertainment sometimes (eg Bend it Like Beckham).</p>
<p>In Judaism there is a concept of a Shem Tov, a good name. The verse in Ecclesiastes says: &#8220;Tov shem m&#8217;shemen tov&#8221;, a good name is better than good oil. Earning a good reputation and keeping it has a place in the Jewish thought.<span id="more-4304"></span></p>
<p>Based on my readings, anecdotal evidence and observations I think it is safe to say that orthodox Jews are very concerned with reputation. It is the currency of our social environment. I remember when I was in high school I would hear about girls who would talk to boys, but not in public because they &#8220;didn&#8217;t want to ruin their name&#8221;. Schools are careful who they accept into their school because with each new student comes their reputation. Families hide dark secrets so as not to ruin the family name. Matchmaking runs almost entirely on the &#8220;good name stock market&#8221;.</p>
<p>In particular, based on the aforementioned sources, I think it safe to say that enclosed chasidic enclaves take reputations to the next level. There is a communal concern about not only personal reputations and family reputations but there is a general community reputation that exists and is cared for.</p>
<p>The way a good reputation is supposed to work is as follows: A person carries their self well, speaks nicely, follows the law, cares for others and slowly but surely, people notice. A reputation is formed.  However, one small act can destroy even the most pristine reputation. And it can be nearly impossible to recover that good name. I am fond of quoting Ray Donovan. Donovan was a high ranking federal government official during the Reagan administration. He was indicted on charges of fraud among other crimes. Eventually he was acquitted. After his acquittal he famously remarked: &#8220;Which office do I go to get my reputation back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed a shem tov can take years to create and be destroyed in an instant.</p>
<p>A good name arises organically. It is a natural result of good deeds and good will. A reputation cannot be fabricated. It cannot be crafted. It cannot be orchestrated. If it is, the reputation is a fraud.</p>
<p>On DovBear&#8217;s blog I posted a note from a fellow living in New Square (see: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/06/insider-reaction-to-new-square-violence.html">The Insider Reaction to New Square Violence</a>). The writer is reacting to the arson / attempted murder of a fellow community by a fellow community member. He focuses very little on the actual incident. Near the end he prays to God. What does he pray?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Why did God allow Skver to take such a public hit and for the entire community to be embarrassed? I am not in heaven, so this makes no sense to me, why we have received such a punishment?</em></p>
<p>Even in New Square&#8217;s darkest moment, the obsession with embarrassment, reputation and good name is apparent.</p>
<p>But the line speaks to a complete misunderstanding of reputation. A reputation is not crafted. It is earned. And it can be lost rather easily. You can&#8217;t keep a good name when your community has committed horrible acts. Sorry.</p>
<p>Yet, there is a concerted effort by communities like New Square to maintain the pristine image they have crafted while sacrificing or simply ousting those who tarnish it. They don&#8217;t address the problems because the problems are not the issue. The issue is the reputation.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> the parents of children with severe issues, whether it was abuse or simply the child&#8217;s concerns about whether they should be religious, were met with a primary concern over reputation and a secondary (if any at all) concern about addressing the issue.</p>
<p>It has been no different in New Square. The Rebbe&#8217;s comments thus far have been his message to try and repair or resurrect his community&#8217;s good name. But of course, the reputation and good name is not the issue at all. The issue is the broken system in his community. The issue is an attempt on a man and his family&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>The lesson is clear. A good name is earned. It is not manufactured in a spin factory. If you behave contrary to your reputation you lose it. More importantly, if your reputation is harmed because of bad deeds, the first step to fixing your reputation is by fixing the bad deeds. The reputation will return the same way it was earned (hopefully). It doesn&#8217;t magically return when you reiterate positive acts that may have contributed to earning the good name.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, in a backwards town, they got it all backwards.</p>

I recommend Rabbi David Fohrman’s<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983269017/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0983269017" target="_blank"> The Queen You Thought You Knew</a>. If you order it today, you can get it before Shabbos and read the book before Purim. It is an easy read and the book is not too long.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983269017/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0983269017" target="_blank">The Queen You Thought You Knew</a> is worthwhile addition to your library. Rabbi Fohrman discusses a novel approach to the Purim story. His work is mostly speculative but presented reasonably and in my opinion, responsibly.</p>
<p>The premise of the book is that there are many many questions that remain unanswered in the Megilla which can be answered with the novel approach of Rabbi Forhman. Many of the questions in the book have been asked and answered by Chazal or more recent rabbis. But I am not aware of any holistic solution to some of the more well known and lesser known challenges within the Megilla narrative.<span id="more-3915"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Forhman takes us on a journey of question, thought and theory to find answers and ultimately his novel approach.</p>
<p>I won’t ruin the book in this post but I will say that it is nothing like anything you have heard before. The book is clearly well researched and well thought out.</p>
<p>Although I wholeheartedly recommend this book. But there is one small caveat. It is important to note that Rabbi Fohrman’s theory is almost completely unsubstantiated in Chazal or other classical sources. It is almost entirely novel and based purely on the text of the Megilla. Rabbi Fohrman himself seems to forewarn of this throughout the book by hedging the theory of the book as speculative and a possibility not to the exclusion of any other idea. To some, this may be a great accomplishment. To others it may be controversial. I think it is a worthwhile read if only for the questions presented and the very novel solution as tenuous as it may be.</p>
<p>While using an academic style of study, the book fails to use any external corroborative materials to support its flimsy premise. In fact, I think the historical record would indicate that the premise is wrong. In my mind, if you&#8217;re going to use academic methodology, you should provide some scholarly support for your premise. This is the biggest and most glaring flaw of the book. Outside of this critique the book&#8217;s premise is elegant and useful.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile to discuss the merits and demerits of the style of study the book represents. It is a departure from typical yeshiva style study in that it is more similar to academic text-based study. This is different than almost every other Torah book that is studied in the yeshiva milieu. It remains to be seen if this will become a more popular form of study or if it will be shunned by the yeshiva fraternity.</p>
<p>This last issue is being discussed in my post on DovBear: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/03/is-rabbi-fohrmans-purim-book.html">Is Rabbi Fohrman&#8217;s Purim Book Controversial?</a></p>

More discussion there: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/11/reform-jews-interested-in-kashrus.html">Reform Jews Interested in Kashrus</a></p>
<p>Ask most Orthodox Jews about Kashrus and Reform Judaism, you&#8217;ll most likely hear a snicker from the uninformed or a reference to the &#8220;Treyfe Banquet&#8221; (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/12/new-national-museum-of-american-jewish-history-in-philadelphia-apparently-misses-the-mark/">New National Museum of American Jewish History In Philadelphia Apparently Misses the Mark</a>) from the more informed. As far as I know, Reform Judaism has never officially sanctioned Kashrus observance.<span id="more-3302"></span></p>
<p>I remember reading an article 3 years ago about young Reform Jews pining to add more ritual observance to their summer camp experience. They wanted to add tefillin, kashrus and a more traditional Shabbos. At the time, I thought that was really cool. (read about it here: <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/reform_youth_flexing_their_ritual_muscle" target="_blank">The Jewish Week</a>).</p>
<p>Today, I saw another step in this direction referenced on Twitter (HT @<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/schnit/status/4586916221550592" target="_blank">schnit</a>). A new book has been published for Reform Jews that want to observe some level of Kashrus. Apparently, this is a first. The book tackles broader issues than simple dietary restrictions such as animal cruelty and treatment / paying laborers.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great. I would only hope that just as Reform Jews are learning from the ideals of Orthodox Jews as far as Kashrus is concerned, Orthodox Jews can learn from the concern the Reform Jews express for animal cruelty and treatment / paying laborers.</p>

<p>Sports-talk radio is abuzz over an incident that occurred a few weeks ago at a High-School football game in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Southington vs Manchester was tied at 14 at halftime. Some time during the first half, a Manchester player dropped his armband with the entire Manchester playbook and the codewords for each of those plays. A Southington player picked it up. The player gave the armband to his coach.</p>
<p>The coach used the information on the armband to stymie the Manchester offense and eventually won the game 28-14.</p>
<p>It seems to me that High-School sports are competitive as well as educational. This was a failed opportunity to educate on fairness, sportsmanship and winning the &#8220;right way&#8221;. But what of the competition aspect? Is this ethical? Is this cheating? Is there a space between cheating and unethical behavior? All good questions.<span id="more-3272"></span></p>
<p>The biggest question for me is, how do we treat sports? Meaning, sports have their own rules, do the rules of the real world apply during the game? Or are the real world rules suspended during the game and as long as you follow the rules of the game you are doing the right thing?</p>
<p>So, what would do you think? What would you do?</p>
<p>(The Coach was suspended for a game)</p>
<p>(And his brother plays for the Patriots, home of the cheating coaches)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/10Kosher-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2937" title="Photo: NY Times" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/10Kosher-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In yesterday&#8217;s New York Time Magazine (and on NYT.com last week) an interesting article about a diverse kosher restaurant in Crown Heights appeared. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/magazine/10Kosher-t.html" target="_blank">Keeping It Kosher</a>) In my opinion the article made three basic points.</p>
<p>1) It is possible for a diverse, upscale kosher restaurant to exist and operate successfully.</p>
<p>2) The community in Crown Heights is not diverse and suffers tensions with its non-Jewish neighbors.</p>
<p>3) The kosher supervision of the restaurant oversees the status of the food and also tries to control the way the clientele behave and dress while in the restaurant.<br />
<span id="more-2936"></span></p>
<p>Point number one is correct. There are other upscale kosher restaurants that cater to all sorts of people and I for one, would like to see more places a kashrus observant business person could take non-kashrus observant friends, clients, partners and bosses without apologizing for subpar food, service and ambiance.</p>
<p>Point number two is not limited by any means to Crown Heights. I have noticed that the more insular a community becomes, the less tolerant they become of others. Perhaps it is more ironic in Crown Heights because of the international (probably soon to be intergalactic) reputation that Chabad shluchim have earned as being open and welcoming to all people.</p>
<p>But it is not a problem specific to Chabad. All Jewish neighborhoods that limit interactions to people that are overwhelmingly similar to one another suffer from a nearsighted view of humanity. It is not just between Jews and non-Jew, it is perhaps even more profound when the differences between Jew and Jew and even more minute differences between Orthodox Jews create closed communities that shun outsiders.</p>
<p>For 500 years we tried to get out of the ghetto. Now that we are out all we want to do retreat into our own self-made ghettos&#8230;</p>
<p>The value of diversity has been challenged. One reason diversity is good is because it forces everyone to be tolerant. Without diversity a ghetto mentality has room to grow. This appplies universally. Orthodox Jews, to WASPy Country Clubs, the Inner City and Suburbia. Monotony breeds contempt.</p>
<p>If you are interested in point number three you will need to go to DovBear: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/10/three-points-on-nyt-mag-article-on.html">Three Points on the NYT Mag Article on Basil</a>. Be warned, if you are not an orthodox Jew, you may not understand what I have written. This is because it involves some intricacies of Jewish Law. No offense.</p>

<p><em>This post has been crossposted to DovBear &#8211; </em><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/09/ncaa-and-contemporary-orthodox-judaism.html"><em>The NCAA and Contemporary Orthodox Judaism</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Last year, Jeremiah Masoli was the quarterback for the Oregon Ducks. He got into some trouble with the law and committed second degree burglary and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. The Ducks cut him from the team and Masoli transferred to Ole Miss.</p>
<p>At first he was considered a transfer and would be forced to sit out the year. He appealed and won the appeal and is now eligible to play for Ole Miss. Apparently, the NCAA does not feel that breaking the law warrants a suspension.</p>
<p>For the last five years, the NCAA has been investigating Reggie Bush and benefits his family received from a potential agent. In finding that Bush broke NCAA rules by accepting gifts (like a house for his family) the NCAA sanctioned USC <span id="more-2808"></span>by taking away scholarships, banning them from bowl games and taking away personal awards. Apparently, the NCAA feels that breaking ITS rules warrants severe punishment.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Rabbi Weil wrote a wonderful article on how Orthodox Judaism has morphed into caring more about its own rules than the rules of society and the laws of our country. (Link: <a href="http://bit.ly/aWdl9X">OU.org</a>) We concentrate so much on the rituals and customs of Orthodox Judaism that set us apart from other religions that sometimes the basics of citizenship get ignored. It is especially egregious because our law has many of those same laws!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost just the NCAA. It seems like we care more about our own rules than the laws of the land. This is wrong.</p>
<p>As we begin a New Year, I think we need to recommit ourselves to the universal laws of good all the while celebrating those laws that make us different. We can afford to ignore neither.</p>

<p>The Westboro Baptist Church practices and preaches an extremely fundamental version of Christianity. They hold that God punishes American soldiers in Iraq because there are &#8220;Gays in the military&#8221;. They hate Jews because Jews are they killed Jesus and are the cause of fornication. They protest at shuls, Holocaust Museums and funerals of soldiers. They are fundamentalists and like many fundies are obscene, anti-social and hateful.</p>
<p>There are orthodox Jews who practice a very fundamental view of Judaism. They say that God killed<span id="more-2698"></span> the Haitians in a massive earthquake because of Gays in the military (or Lashon Hara) See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/04/why-the-earthquake-in-haiti-happened/">Why The Earthquake in Haiti Happened</a>. They say that Hurricane Katrina was punishment for Mardi Gras. They have been known to murder innocent people for the sake of their beliefs They hate liberals because they allow for depravity such as gay marriage. They protest all over on behalf of their causes.</p>
<p>There are Jihadist Muslims who practice a very fundamental and oftentimes violent version of Islam. They wish to rid the world of infidels, including Jews. They have bombed and fired weapons and thrown rocks in favor of their cause. They hate pretty much everyone that is not exactly like them and have no desire to integrate into a democratic society.</p>
<p>There are environmentalists who believe in a very fundamental version of liberalism. They are super passionate about the environment and nature. They stand in front of bulldozers, destroy private property and call people names all to protect nature. They put their lives at risk for their cause and spend millions of dollars promoting their cause. They put their cause above all else (for example instead of procreating) See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/22/green-gone-wild/">Green Gone Wild</a>.</p>
<p>In all these examples, the extremists make a lot of noise and find their way into the headlines. Would it be fair to associate these extreme elements with the more moderate practitioners of their ideologies? Of course not. I don&#8217;t want to be judged by the crazed acts of fundamentalist orthodox Jews and I am sure that moderate Muslims, Christian and Liberals feel the same way about the extremists in their ideologies.</p>
<p>Extremism is bad. Nobody likes it except the ones acting extreme. I find it disturbing that Islam is judged solely by its extreme and fairly recent activities. Prior to the 20th century, Muslims were far more benevolent to members of other religions than Christians were. Recently, extremists have become the face of Islam. I think that is unfortunate. It is our best interest to support moderate forms of Islam and help them fight against the extremists.</p>
<p>Are there dangerous forms of Islam? Yes. Are there dangerous forms of all faiths, beliefs and ideologies? Yes again. We should be working together to foster moderates who are tolerant of others in all walks of life.</p>

<p>It seems that the Cordoba House in downtown Manhattan has cleared a major hurdle by winning a 9-0 vote of the Landmarks Conservation Commission. (NY Times <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/mosque-near-ground-zero-clears-key-hurdle/?hp" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>Conservatives and liberals seem to be at loggerheads on this particular issue. Sarah Palin made headlines with her plea that the center be blocked and fellow right wing pundits have expressed their distaste to the center. They feel it disgraces the deceased by glorifying what they believe to be the religion that caused the tragedy at Ground Zero almost 9 years ago. Liberals, on the other hand, see the center as an olive branch to Islam and think the center glorifies America, not the dangerous form of Islamic Fundamentalism that took down the Twin Towers, 3000 victims and the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say whether the center is an affront or not.<span id="more-2689"></span> That&#8217;s because it varies with each person. Everyone is free to react as they choose. I can&#8217;t say one side is right and one side is wrong.</p>
<p>What I can say is that the center has a bad marketing plan.</p>
<p>The center is not a mosque. It is a massive cultural center. There is a sanctuary planned but it is a minor part of a broader institution. An institution that, according to their website attempts to bring the gap between Islam and the West. An institution that also fights for women&#8217;s rights and opportunitities within Islam. In fact, if we are to believe the Cordoba website, it is exactly what Americans (especially Conservatives) should be supporting.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cordoba House is a Muslim-led project which will build a world-class facility that promotes tolerance, reflecting the rich diversity of New York City.  The center will be community-driven, serving as a platform for inter-community gatherings and cooperation at all levels, providing a space for all New Yorkers to enjoy.</p>
<p>This proposed project is about promoting integration, tolerance of difference and community cohesion through arts and culture.  Cordoba House will provide a place where individuals, regardless of their backgrounds, will find a center of learning, art and culture; and most importantly, a center guided by Islamic values in their truest form &#8211; compassion, generosity, and respect for all.</p>
<p>The site will contain tremendous amounts of resources that otherwise would not exist in Lower Manhattan; a 500-seat auditorium, swimming pool, art exhibition spaces, bookstores, restaurants &#8211; all these services would form a cultural nexus for a region of New York City that, as it continues to grow, requires the sort of hub that Cordoba House will provide.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why call themselves a mosque? Bad marketing.</p>
<p>The center is not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221; either. It is 2 blocks away. If you&#8217;ve never been to Manhattan you can&#8217;t appreciate how FAR part 2 blocks in NYC are. Two blocks in Manhattan is very far. It is a few minutes walk and more importantly, it is certainly not within the line of sight. They should be saying that their center is a few minutes walk from Ground Zero. Not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221;.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2690" title="Cordoba Location" src="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map1.jpg?resize=500%2C245" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>So the Mosque at Ground Zero is neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero. It is an Islamic Center in Downtown Manhattan. Is that still as offensive to those who oppose the center?</p>
<p>The only reasonable explanation for opposition that remains is conspiracy.</p>
<p>In other words, the website is a sham. The REAL purpose of Cordoba House is to spread Fundamental Islam and serve as a springboard for the continued spread of Islam in their quest for world dominance. This is Islamaphobia.</p>
<p>There are people who believe this to be the case. I do not.</p>
<p>If you are asking me, which you aren&#8217;t, I say support the Cordoba House and the brand of Islam they espouse and perhaps get involved a see it for yourself if you are not convinced. Working together will go a long way.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.uk.msn.com/world/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=154192555">Israel&#8217;s Outrageous Rape Case</a></p>
<p>Over on DovBear (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/07/israeli-court-shames-itself-with.html">Israeli Court Shames Itself With Idiotic Ruling</a>) there is a fairly predictable post and discussion about the merits of the Israeli court decision.<span id="more-2667"></span> I am certain that the conversation over there is reflective of many similar conversations around the world.</p>
<p>There are two points that I would like to address regarding this case.</p>
<p>First, the issue of consent to sex is highly volatile. On the one hand, it protects women by punishing low-lives who force themselves onto women who may be vulnerable. On the other hand it is very paternalistic. It basically tells women that &#8220;you cannot be trusted with men so the law will take care of you&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is not politically correct to say, but women are more vulnerable than men as a general rule. Men tend to be bigger, stronger and more aggressive. Could a woman beat me up? Yes. Could a woman rape a man? I am sure. But the history of men taking advantage of women tells me that women do need protection by the law.</p>
<p>Second is the inherent racism in the case. And no, I do not mean the court is racist in its ruling.</p>
<p>I mean the &#8220;victim&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the man is Israeli it is okay to sleep with him after just meeting him, but if he is Arab then it is not okay to sleep with him?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that she feels this way. But what is the <em>basis</em> for her feeling this way? If she was very religious then perhaps she is concerned with the Jewish law of &#8220;marrying&#8221; a Jew. But I don&#8217;t think that is what it is.</p>
<p>I think it indicates a strong social aversion to Arabs in Israeli society. So strong that a woman who is willing to sleep with a new acquaintance would not do so if he was Arab.</p>
<p>The court is dealing with the facts on the ground. She would not have consented if she knew he was Arab. That legal issue deserves discussion. What I think is a more productive discussion is why she feels that way.</p>
<p>What factors are okay to consider before sleeping with a man and what factors are not okay? The court seems to think that ethnicity is important enough that her consent was voided. In Israel it is possible that it is that important.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Arabs feel 2nd Class in Israel?</p>
<p>I understand how and why that social reality came to exist.</p>
<p>I also think that perhaps it is more harmful than helpful at this point.</p>

<p><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/07/dancing-at-auschwitz.html"></a>Everyone has been talking about this video.</p>
<p>From the description:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>On a recent trip to Europe, a family of three generations (a Holocaust survivor, his daughter and his grandchildren) dance to Gloria Gaynor&#8217;s pop song &#8211; &#8216;I Will Survive&#8217; at concentration camps and memorials throughout Europe.</em></p>
<p><em>This dance is a tribute to the tenacity of the human spirit and a celebration of life.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Is it appropriate for a survivor and his family to celebrate their survival in this manner? Everyone seems to have an opinion.<span id="more-2657"></span></p>
<p>When I saw it, I was not &#8220;offended&#8221;, but then again, I am a 4th generation American. I have no Holocaust scars in my direct ancestry. It&#8217;s possible I am not as sensitive as I ought to be about this.</p>
<p>Having said that, I prefer to see this family as the modern day Rabbi Akiva who laughed when he saw the great Temple in ruins. When his weeping comrades asked him how he could cry at such a sight he reminded them that just as the destruction of the Temple was predicted, so too the rebuilding of the Temple and the return from exile was predicted.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiva survived and he was confident that we would survive as a people. He was confident we would survive with our hopes and dreams intact even after witnessing a horrible event like the destruction of the Temple and the deaths of the thousands of Jews living in Jerusalem. The ever present optimism for the future has been a calling card for Jewish people for two millennia and Rabbi Akiva practically invented it.</p>
<p>On the eve of Tisha B&#8217;Av my father told me a wonderful Torah thought. At the end of the second chapter of Makkos there is an argument between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yehuda holds that if a man is exiled as punishment for a negligent homicide, when his term completes he cannot return to his position of authority (like prince of the tribe) that he held before his exile. Rabbi Meir holds that one returning from exile can reclaim his position of authority. Halachically we follow Rabbi Yehuda. But Rabbi Meir was the student of Rabbi Akiva. It seems that Rabbi Akiva had integrated this lesson into his worldview and taught it to his student Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Akiva had such optimism that the Jewish people would return from their exile and reclaim the lofty position in Israel, with the Temple that he laughed when he saw its destruction.</p>
<p>Seems to me, these folks are students of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Meir. We need optimism. We need hope for the future. We need to be confident in our future. Dancing at Auschwitz tells me that these folks have that optimism.</p>

We mourn the loss of the great Temple in Jerusalem, and all that it symbolized. We lament the loss of our national unity and the special Temple connection. We hope and pray for a complete redemption and the messianic era of peace, harmony and sprirituality.</p>
<p>(Read my thoughts on Tisha B&#8217;Av from last year: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/30/mourning-the-living-on-the-9th-of-av/">Mourning The Living On The 9th of Av</a>)</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with the custom to fast for 25 hours as a sign of our mourning. We suffer to try and feel what we are missing. For many people, Tisha B&#8217;Av is a fast day and nothing else.</p>
<p>That is tragic.<span id="more-2644"></span></p>
<p>Over on DovBear, (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/07/gods-thoughts-on-tisha-bav.html">God&#8217;s Thoughts on Tisha B&#8217;Av</a>) my good friend Henoch has posted a very insightful anecdote <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2307.htm" target="_blank">from Zecharia Chapter 7</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the second Temple was being rebuilt, the Jews had been keeping the 4 fast days related to the destruction for the last 70 years. It occurred to residents of Bavel that perhaps these fasts were obsolete. After all, the Temple was being rebuilt, so why would they continue to mourn over its destruction? They assembled a delegation to go to Jerusalem where the halachic question would be brought to the leadership that still included Neviim. The answer given by God through Zechariah Hanavi is quite surprising and would be considered completely inappropriate had anyone else given that answer.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>At first the question of whether to fast or not, is ignored. Then Zechariah said in the name of God that when Jews eat at times that they deem appropriate, or fast when they decide to fast, they do so because it is what they think will serve their own interests. It isn’t necessarily for the right reasons. Zechariah essentially states that our idea of fasting misses the mark and even questions its’ sincerity. He then goes further and says in the name of God what would be a more proper approach to the subject. He says that the correct approach to this problem is to<br />
“Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.”<br />
Being that the Jews ignored these basic ideas, they were exiled and scattered across the world.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>God is looking at us and saying, it is quite simple, and it has always been quite simple. I don’t want false piety or even grand programs that are limited to fasting and davening. If you want to do them, that is your decision. But don’t lose sight of what I want. God says “I want honesty, compassion and love”.</p></blockquote>
<p>We cannot allow the secondary customs and practices to become primary. We cannot become so wrapped up in our customs, such as fasting, and forget the direct commandments from God.</p>
<p>We know what we need to do.</p>
<p>Please do not merely fast this year on Tisha B&#8217;Av. Take the lessons of Zecharia 7 and try to be the best we can be in all of our actions.</p>

<p>This is what the shoe feels like when it&#8217;s on the other foot.</p>
<p>For decades, right-wing / republican / conservative / Judeo-Christian Valuists have talked a big game when it comes to fighting crime. Running on &#8220;Law and Order&#8221; platforms and promising harsh sentences for criminals was a sure way to gain support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, bleeding heart liberals have been trying to model the justice system after the softer Euro sentencing structures.</p>
<p>Traditionally, middle class white people support Law and Order style justice. Harsh sentences make them feel safer and they are less likely to know someone who will be incarcerated, thus they are removed from the effects of the harsh sentencing of criminals.</p>
<p>Lower class folks usually support softer punishments.<span id="more-2572"></span> They are the ones who are more likely to have friends and relatives in the justice system. For many of them, the softer the punishment, the sooner they get their daddy back.</p>
<p>It was real easy for us middle class white (Jewish) people to support strict sentencing guidelines when it didn&#8217;t really affect us. But after witnessing one of our own fall prey to the system we helped create I am sure we all feel differently. (Of course I am aware that there are some middle class white Jews who vote democrat and support liberal causes, I am talking to everyone else.)</p>
<p>27 years is a long time. Rubashkin is a crook but his sentence is very harsh. We now feel what lower class communities have felt for so long. Some of us now think the system is out to get us. They have felt that way all along. Some of us now are horrified by the sentencing guidelines and the leeway given to particularly strict judges. They have been saying this is a problem all along.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time for our community to more fully support softer punishments for all criminals. In some states (like mine &#8211; California) we are spending millions and millions of dollars locking up &#8220;3 Strikes&#8221; criminals for LIFE (including non-violent, minor felonies). That is even harsher than Rubashkin&#8217;s sentence. If we are outraged over his sentence let that outrage spill over into more socially conscious, activist role and help modify our current justice system.</p>
<p>But please, for intellectual honesty&#8217;s sake, be consistent. If you think Rubashkin got a raw deal, do some research and learn about how other people who made mistakes in their teens will spend their entire lives in jail because of America&#8217;s love of retribution. Help everyone who got shafted by the system and let&#8217;s try and prevent this from happening again, to anyone.</p>

<p>There is a healthy nostalgia built into Judaism. &#8220;Chadesh yameni k&#8217;kedem&#8221; &#8211; renew our days to the way things were, we say. Of course, like any good thing, too much nostalgia is a bad thing.</p>
<p>After reading the famous case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio">Brandenburg v. Ohio</a> I find myself pining for the anti-Jewish sentiment as expressed in 60&#8217;s as opposed to today.</p>
<div>Brandenburg was a Ku Klux Klan leader in Ohio. At a KKK rally, men dressed in robes and hoods burned a cross and made public declarations of hate.<span id="more-2567"></span> Among their offensive epithets:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bury the niggers&#8221;, &#8220;Freedom for the whites&#8221;, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get them back to the dark garden&#8221;,</p></blockquote>
<p>(see FN1 in the Court opinion for the complete list) all clearly anti-black statements that are highly offensive.</p>
</div>
<div>Of course, no good KKK rally is complete without some anti-Jewish fun as well. These KKK Jew haters proclaimed:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Send the Jews back to Israel&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Today&#8217;s anti-Jewish proclamations are more likely to echo Helen Thomas and say &#8220;Get the Jews out of Israel&#8221;.</div>
<div>Oh how I yearn for the anti-semites of yore. They were so much nicer to us&#8230;</div>

<p>If you are like me, you have been reading about the Rubashkin saga for months. What began with a Federal raid at a meat processing plant to ferret out hundreds of illegal alien employees is now culminating with a federal and state trial.<a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/anti-semitic-poster1.jpg"> (</a><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26626858" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that the raid was &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; and fueled by anti-semitism.</p>
<div>
<p>If you are like me you have been hearing that he was denied bail because of an anti-semitic fear that Rubashkin was a flight risk and would flee to Israel.</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that his federal sentencing recommendation was anti-semitic. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/us/29postville.html" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing how the county jail was anti-semitic in not providing food that was kosher &#8220;to Rubashkin&#8217;s standards&#8221; and not permitting him to wear religious garb (tzitzis / tzitzit). (<a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20100509/NEWS/5090342/Rubashkin-dispute-highlights-faith-issue" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>I have three things I want to say.<span id="more-2466"></span></p>
<p>1) I feel terribly for Rubashkin. I feel terribly for any criminal who is sentenced to prison but more-so when the criminal is a family member of mine. As a fellow Jew, Rubashkin is family and it pains me to see him in this state. I support asking for leniency is a mentshlach way.</p>
<p>2) Rubashkin is the cause of much of the animosity towards him from the prosecution and judiciary. It is NOT, I repeat, NOT because he is Jewish, nor is it anti-semitic.</p>
<p>3) Even those who cry anti-semitism in this case are grossly misusing the term.</p>
<p>I think #1 is a well represented opinion throughout the Jewish community. It does not require any more attention from me. Consider me to have said &#8220;ditto&#8221;.</p>
<p>Number 2 is something that has been so wildly misunderstood it almost seems blatant. The reason Rubashkin&#8217;s plant was raided was NOT due to a plan hatched in the bowels of a Ku Klux Klan facility. The reason his plant was raided was because he snubbed the Unions by hiring illegals and the Unions were none-too-happy. They made the infractions known to the Feds and they raided the plant. Were there too many helicopters and fancy weapons? Probably. Was it anti-semitic? Probably not. The people who make these kinds of choices don&#8217;t, actually, CAN&#8217;T have vendettas against minorities. This is the Federal Government of the most benevolent host the Jewish people have ever had. Use your noodle people! There is no conspiracy! Who was president at the time? Our best friend George W. Bush. The federal agents were in his employ. Dare we think that the &#8220;anti-semitic raid&#8221; was orchestrated by our dear friend? Of course not.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Rubashkin was considered a flight-risk because agents found $10,000 cash in a packed bag with passports. Under normal circumstances that is a flight-risk. A packed bag with cash and passports could be reasonably interpreted as a &#8220;just-in-case&#8221; bag. Maybe it was a &#8220;just-in-case Moshiach comes bag&#8221;. I am willing to believe that was the case. But what would you think if you saw that bag and he wasn&#8217;t a frum Jew? Is it anti-semitism to draw the logical conclusion from finding that bag and denying him bail? Certainly not.</p>
<p>The sentencing recommendation was well within Federal guidelines. I was talking about the case to a lawyer friend of mine who works for the Court of Appeals and who knew nothing about the case. I told him some of the facts about the bank fraud. His immediate reaction was, &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was a Jew. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was accused of other crimes. He only knew about the bank fraud and he said &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. Is he anti-semitic? Who cares?! He didn&#8217;t know the cases involved a Jew when he said a life sentence was what the crook deserved!</p>
<p>Also, much has been made of &#8220;comparable criminals&#8221;. It is an unfair comparison because Rubashkin has not been cooperative. He was not willing to accept any plea deals. He maintains his complete, 100% innocence and is a difficult person for the court to deal with. He has many special requests and claims he is being victimized. He has offered only one half-baked apology since this saga began and has not taken any responsibility.</p>
<p>While in jail, Rubashkin has made special requests. Some have been honored and some have not. Some of the requests that have been honored and he has stated that he not satisfied with the kashrus of the food. It is kosher, just not kosher enough. Is it anti-semitic if they give him kosher food that most orthodox Jews would eat?</p>
<p>Also, Rubashkin will not walk without wearing Tzitzis. He states that his religion will not allow him to walk. So he has been carried around so that he will not violate this religious law. The problem is that he is with ignorant of the law or is just trying to be annoying. The law is that when one wears a four-cornered garment (think of a poncho or rectangular wrap) the garment must have a certain formula of strings attached to the garment at the corners. One is not required to wear such a garment. However it has become customary to wear one of these garments with the strings attached for prayer as well as during the day. But if you are not wearing a four-cornered garment the law does not require that you wear the strings (like a button-down shirt or blazer don&#8217;t need the strings). So why is Rubashkin making a stink out of an issue that is not religious? Is it anti-semitic if the jail does not cooperate with this?</p>
<p>I think it is clear enough that for every &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; act against Rubashkin, there is a plausible non-anti-semitic explanation as well. Let&#8217;s just stop with the anti-semitism cries.</p>
<p>As for #3, I dare you to look a Holocaust survivor in the eye and call this anti-semitism. Try telling it to a Jew who was thrown out of Spain and Portugal for not bowing to the Cross. Or how about Jews who were slaughtered during pogroms? Being prosecuted for actual crimes is not anti-semitism. Anti-semitism is hatred and cruelty to Jews for no reason other than the fact that they are Jewish. That is not the case here.</p>
<p>I have more to say about anti-semitism in general. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

<p>Nothing like a Supreme Court of the United States nomination to get me to blog again.</p>
<p>Elena Kagan has been nominated for the SCOTUS. I have no opinion about her. I do have an opinion about some of the people opposing her&#8230;</p>
<p>I have been planning a brief series on anti-semitism. This post will be the first of a few that deal with various specifics and nuances of anti-semitism in my opinion.</p>
<p>Have you seen the <a href="http://innate-differences.blogspot.com/2010/05/one-picture-worth-1000-kikes.html" target="_blank">cries of anti-semitism</a> connected with Kagan? They come from Orthodox Jews who have trouble dealing with their own insecurities. Why?<span id="more-2452"></span></p>
<p>Most RW Jews are very conservative politically. Kagan is not. Her existence and certainly her appointment the SCOTUS is not viewed favorably in their eyes. Subconsciously, they need a way to protest her appointment and the first thing that pops into their minds is the old &#8220;anti-semitism card&#8221;.</p>
<p>People point to the caricature of her as anti-semitic. People think that it is reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Nazi propaganda was general. It showed Jews as having certain features and overemphasized those features in order to make a separate point. &#8220;Jews steal&#8221;, &#8220;Jews are like vermin&#8221;, &#8220;Jews run the world&#8221;, etc. The caricature was to paint a villain with gross features and then label the villain with gross acts. It works better than painting the villain with gross acts with a face like Clooney or Pitt&#8230;</p>
<p>The cartoon of Kagan is just a cartoon. It exaggerates her features because those are HER features. It&#8217;s the same way a Leno cartoon has a huge chin and Bush cartoon has a squat head and long ears. It pokes fun at their appearance but is in no way anti-long chin or anti-squat head with long ears. Accentuating Kagan&#8217;s features in a cartoon can&#8217;t be off limits because she happens to be Jewish.</p>
<p>A second thing about all this anti-semitism talk is very ironic. I have not seen any reports from mainstream media that even mentions that Kagan is Jewish. It is not an issue for most people. Why do we think that it is an issue? It&#8217;s like we invent an issue to get upset about. Kagan was chosen because of her credentials and the diversity she brings to the court. Doesn&#8217;t that champion minorities like Jews? How is that anti-semitic!?</p>
<p>The last thing I want to address is the complaint lodged by a commenter on DovBear&#8217;s post. Mamzer Talmid Chacham said &#8220;I&#8217;d still like it better if he nominated someone who was actually a judge&#8221;. It so happens that one of the greatest SCOTUS justices of all time, Justice Warren, was not a judge. One large criticism of the SCOTUS is the seemingly similar paths all the justices took to get to the court. Choosing Kagan adds another element of much needed diversity to the court.</p>

The architecture, decor and opulence of the building is stunning and I love it.</p>
<p>There is however one part of the Library of Congress which I vehemently must disagree with.</p>
<p>What part? Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
<p>Over on DovBear, there has been a running discussion as to the meaning of the 8th Principle of Maimonidies.<span id="more-2438"></span></p>
<p>According to Maimonidies, in order to be an observant Jew, one must believe in a number of tenets. These 13 tenets are not observable or provable by scientific measure. They require suspension of disbelief or more accurately &#8211; belief.</p>
<p>The simple reading of the 8th Tenet seems problematic to many people.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I believe with complete faith that the entire Torah which is now in our possession is the same as that which was given to Moshe Rabbeinu (Moses our teacher), may he rest in peace.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many assume this means that Maimonidies believed the 5 Books of Moses were unchanged from Sinai. This is patently false. The Talmud itself recognizes that there are discrepencies that existed in different Torah scrolls over time.</p>
<p>To see the more precise version of this tenet head over to DovBear&#8217;s blog: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/05/rambams-8th-principle-according-to-r.html">The Rambam&#8217;s 8th Principle According to R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg</a></p>
<p>The main point of the post is that Maimonidies holds that we must believe that Moses was not an author, he was a scribe. Moses did not add an ounce of creativity to the Torah. He was just writing what he was told.</p>
<p>Is this rational? No. But this is what we are required to believe.</p>
<p>In the Great Hall in the Library of Congress, there are tablets on the slope toward the ceiling. The Library of Congress has sixteen such tablets around the Great Hall ceiling and each has the name of a famous author. <a href="http://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/jeff1.html" target="_blank">The names are</a> DANTE, HOMER, MILTON, BACON, ARISTOTLE, GOETHE, SHAKESPEARE, MOLIERE, <em><strong>MOSES</strong></em>, HERODOTUS, CERVANTES, HUGO, SCOTT, COOPER, LONGFELLOW, TENNYSON, GIBBON, and BANCROFT.</p>
<p>Is the Library of Congress required to believe in the 8th Principle of Maimonidies? No.</p>
<p>They can hold that Moses was an author along with the other 15 literary giants.</p>
<p>To me, it&#8217;s just a mistake and a disagreement between the Library of Congress and Maimonidies.</p>
<p><em>FAVOR: If you have been to the LOC and have a picture of what I am describing &#8211; PLEASE email it to me. If you are going to the LOC sometime soon, PLEASE take a photo for me! Thanks.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-style: normal;">UPDATE: Reader, Mark has emailed me this photo, thanks:</span></em></p>

It was Purim and they wanted to take pictures, talk with me and some of our Shul members and join in our Purim Celebration.</p>
<p>Never ones to turn down inviting strangers into the Shul, we welcomed them.</p>
<p>As I wrote at the time, our Purim Celebration was really special as we welcomed anyone and everyone off the boardwalk into our Shul. Read more here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/">Pacific Jewish Center Purim Celebration Recap February 28, 2010</a></p>
<p>Nancy took beautiful candid photos and David kind of blended in with the rest of us<span id="more-2382"></span> talking to us and learning about the Pacific Jewish Center and the festival of Purim.</p>
<p>Purim is a funny time to be introduced to new people. Things are a little different on Purim. But David managed to get to know us in a way that I never thought an outsider could.</p>
<p>Nancy and David produced a wonderful photo-film of their visit. It is part of their Escape Into America Series. The series is incredible. They have managed to find a lot of soul throughout their travels and it really comes through in their work.</p>
<p>In the photo-film about us, they did a really super job cutting through it all and finding the soul of our shul.</p>
<p>There are a couple things in the photo-film that are not perfectly precise, but that&#8217;s okay. (2 minor corrections: 1- I did mention to David that Purim costumes were likely borrowed for the Venice Carnival in the 15th Century and yet costumes fit in well with the themes of the day, 2- I am not sure I actually said that the Shul was in danger of disappearing &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t, rather, it could have been on that path).</p>
<p>Other than a couple minor mistakes the photo-film really captures the essence of Purim in our Shul as well as much of the essence of who we are at Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>The video stars everyone, but Yosef Beithalachmi (aka Mr. Pickles) and Ashi Bersin are featured in the voice-over. Great job!</p>

<p>Rabbi Steven Pruzansky is making headlines with <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/42879" target="_blank">his front page Jewish Press article in which he thoroughly disposes of Orthopraxy and ousts the Orthoprax from Modern Orthodoxy</a>.</p>
<p>For a thorough fisking of the main parts of the article <a href="http://modernorthoprax.blogspot.com/2010/03/is-rabbi-steven-pruzansky-idiot.html" target="_blank">go to XGH&#8217;s blog</a>, this is his area of expertise.</p>
<p>What Rabbi Pruzansky&#8217;s article made me ponder is the relevance of Orthopraxy to the average Frum Jew. <span id="more-2254"></span>In my opinion there are two kinds of Orthoprax Jews. There are Orthoprax theologians and Orthoprax by Default. The theologians are those that &#8220;believe&#8221; in Orthopraxy. <a href="http://modernorthoprax.blogspot.com" target="_blank">XGH</a> and <a href="http://orthoprax.blogspot.com" target="_blank">others</a><em> are the most vocal of this group.</em> This is the group Rabbi Pruzansky heaps his disdain upon. He blames them for all of the problems he sees in his community and seems to think that if you sin, it must be because really you are Orthoprax. You must be the &#8220;non-believer in our midst&#8221;. It is unseemly, and I do not wish to address his comments. <em>(It&#8217;s ironic because the Orthoprax, by dint of their theology value the acts of Judaism MORE than the beliefs of Judaism. While the Orthodox need to balance the two and one could be Orthodox and still sin all the time. That is why we have Yom Kippur and the mitzva of Teshuva. In other words, I would expect an Orthodox Jew to sin at least as often as an Orthoprax. But I digress.)</em></p>
<p>I think that within the Frum spectrum, from LWMO all the way through RW Yeshivish and Chasidish, there are many &#8220;closet&#8221; Orthoprax by Default Jews. I don&#8217;t mean to say, they are Orthoprax on purpose. I mean that they practice Judaism purely out of habit or social pressure, or conditioning. These are the Frum people you see all the time that are simply uneducated or uninformed on the basic tenets of their beliefs. Sure, they may have memorized the 13 Ikkarim, or other formulae for their beliefs, but their actions speak way louder than their thoughts. They can&#8217;t articulate why they do what they do. For many people, the issues of hashkafa and emunah are not part of their lives. They do all the mitzvos they can, they follow halacha, but it is void of any &#8220;theology&#8221;. It is just their &#8220;lifestyle&#8221;. That is also Orthoprax. And that is something that is common, prevalent and ubiquitous throughout any sect of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>This is not ideal. But it is reality. Rabbi Pruzansky seems to assume that all Frum Jews who practice halachic Judaism are familiar with their &#8220;dox&#8221;. But they are not. And sadly, these Jews do not even want to be Orthoprax, but they are by default. Instead of worrying about the people that have defined their beliefs as separate from traditional Frum Judaism, we would be better served helping the closet Orthoprax who WANT to be Orthodox become Orthodox in the truest sense of the word.</p>
<p>Our system has become great at creating robots. I call them Orthoprax by Default. We can do better&#8230;</p>

<p>Since the Earthquake in Haiti many have attempted to figure out &#8220;why&#8221; the tragedy occurred.</p>
<p>There are 4 prominent versions going around the web right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/01/22/the-earth-trembles/" target="_blank">Rabbi Shafran Version 1</a>: God punished the people of Haiti because of evil speech.<br />
<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/01/27/a-personal-note-to-cross-currents-readers/" target="_blank">Rabbi Shafran Version 2</a>: We don&#8217;t know why God punished the people of Haiti but the lesson is that we should learn is not to speak evil speech.<br />
<a href="http://www.frumsatire.net/2010/02/03/presenting-rabbi-yehuda-levin/" target="_blank">Rabbi Levin</a>: The earthquake and Tsunami and 9/11 happened because of Gays in the military.<br />
<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/02/02/haiti-and-the-mind-of-g-d/" target="_blank">Rabbi Feldman</a>: We can&#8217;t know why the earthquake happened, but it happened for &#8220;a reason&#8221;.</p>
<p>What has been missing from this is a more rational approach<span id="more-2094"></span> predicated on the teachings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Weinberg" target="_blank">Rav Yaakov Weinberg</a> Ztz&#8221;l Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Yisrael.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a hypothetical question.</p>
<p>Gerald is driving through the desert. He gets lost and runs out of fuel. He gets out of the car to start walking to find a gas station. He wanders for a little while. Eventually he runs out of water. He dehydrates and eventually dies in the desert.</p>
<p>Why did he die?</p>
<p>That is easy. He died because he ran out of water in a desert. The rules of nature that God created and recreates every moment dictate that when a man has no water in a desert he will dehydrate and probably die shortly thereafter. God does not bend or adjust the rules of nature to save him. Nor should God bend the rules of nature. The relationship God has with the world is that of a hidden God. God hides behind the mask of nature and does not show Himself.</p>
<p>There is a fault line the lies beneath Port Au Prince. <a href="http://www.haitixchange.com/index.php/hx/Articles/possibilty-of-earthquake-in-port-au-prince//" target="_blank">It was suggested by geologists in late 2008</a> that there could be a severe earthquake in Haiti as a result of this fault line. In January 2010 the plates along the fault line shifted. A massive earthquake ensued. Thousands of people died and many more were injured.</p>
<p>Why did they die?</p>
<p>That is also easy. They died because there was an earthquake. The rules of nature that God created and recreates at every moment dictate that when tectonic plates shift it can cause a massive earthquake. God does not bend or adjust the rules of nature to stop the earthquake. Nor should God bend the rules of nature. The relationship God has with the world is that of a hidden God. God hides behind the mask of nature and does not show Himself.</p>
<p>What about the stories in Chumash and Tanach (Old Testament) that report miracles to save individuals or groups of people?</p>
<p>Once in a while God does bend the rules of nature. This is rare and only happens in extreme circumstances. We call this a miracle. It is really a misnomer because everything is a miracle. Nature is a miracle just as much as the supernatural. But we only recognize or would recognize the supernatural miraculous. Miracles can happen, but we don&#8217;t rely on miracles nor do we expect miracles as part of the usual system and order of the universe. The universe follows the rules of nature that God created and recreates every moment.</p>
<p>What about the words of Chazal (Talmudic Rabbis) that blame natural disasters on sin?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t answer with certainty but there are a few options:</p>
<p>&#8211; For lack of scientific information they did not realize that earthquakes or other phenomena were &#8220;natural&#8221; and supposed they were supernatural events thus requiring a Divine reason.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were referring to a place and time where God did intervene on a constant basis.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were speaking polemically and urging Klal Yisrael to improve their ways and as a way of admonishing them they used exegesis to connect disaster with sin.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were misquoted or quoted out of context.</p>
<p>Then there is the Rambam. In hilchos Taanis, the Rambam states that when harm befalls the tzibur it incumbent upon klal yisrael to do teshuva and attribute the suffering the &#8220;way of the world&#8221; rather the bad things that happened were because of their evil sins.</p>
<p>This has been misquoted and misapplied in many instances. The Rambam is talking about a tragedy that happens to the tzibur. The tzibur refers to the Jewish community. So a harm among the a specific Jewish community is the time that we must attribute the harm to OUR sins.</p>
<p>What Rabbis Shafran Version 1, Feldman and Levin are doing is trying to use this Rambam in an instance of a tragedy that befell ANOTHER group of people. The earthquake was not a disaster that happened to the Jewish tzibur. It happened to another tzibur. Thus, the Rambam does not apply.</p>
<p>When would the Rambam apply? At most a tragedy that targets the tzibur. Most strictly constructed it would be when a harm is specific to the Jewish people.</p>
<p>So what are we supposed to do when tragedy strikes? When there is a Hurricane like Katrina, a Tsunami like there was in Southeast Asia or Earthquake like in Haiti?</p>
<p>We work on our compassion. We work on our empathy. We help as much as we can. We remember that life is fleeting and it can all end in a moment. We try to reenergize our relationships. We improve in our avodas Hashem. We find a way to use the tragedy to inspire us. It is personal.</p>
<p>For anyone to assume they know why this tragedy happened fails on three counts.</p>
<p>1) It did not happen to us. It happened to someone else. Do we believe in a God who punishes another party for OUR sins?</p>
<p>2) Maybe it did not happen for a reason? If it was natural then how are you going to apply some sin as the cause for nature? Do you blame sin every time a lion eats a gazelle in the African plain? How about when an innocent bystander is killed by a drunk driver? Did the bystander &#8220;deserve it&#8221;?</p>
<p>3) Even if it did happen for a reason, who are you to tell me why it happened? You think YOU know? Your puny little brain can figure out why God acts in the way He does? You know all the factors that go into &#8220;causing a natural disaster&#8221;? At best it is presumptuous at worst it is extreme arrogance bordering on apikorsus.</p>
<p>For anyone to guess why this happened fails on another count.</p>
<p>Nevuah (prophecy) ended thousands of years ago. A Navi (prophet) was like a spiritual doctor, one was able to see a Navi and ask why bad things were happening to you and the Navi could tell you why. The Navi was connected to God. That is over. It ended a long time ago. I am suspect of anyone claiming to know what God is &#8220;thinking&#8221; because they have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Trying to pretend like we know why the earthquake happened, even if we assume it happened for a reason, is wrong.</p>
<p>But at least Rabbi Shafran Version 2 and Rabbi Feldman are telling US to improve our lives in the wake of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Only one goofball has the gall to tell OTHER people how to act in response to the tragedy. Only Levin has the audacity to tell the Government of the USA that it&#8217;s &#8220;their fault&#8221; this happened. Only Levin completely abrogates himself and places the blame on something that is external to him and his group.</p>
<p>It is akin to telling a grieving mother that her son who was run over by a car was run over because the lady across the street had an affair. Ridiculous. Irresponsible. Self-righteous. Idiotic. Moronic. (Help me out here… I am sure there are more words…)</p>
<p>In summary, there are varying levels of what I believe to be errors in the wake of this tragedy. The least egregious is trying to figure what the precise message of the earthquake is. The most egregious is telling a 3rd party that they caused the tragedy of another.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/14/jewish-relief-efforts-for-haiti-earthquake-victims/" target="_blank">My view, as I stated just after the earthquake</a>, and the view of my Rebbeim is that the tragedy was a natural disaster. There was no malicious intent or direct message being sent to the people of Haiti or anyone else for that matter. However, it is useful for us to use the incident as inspiration to improve our lives and live each moment we are fortunate to be alive as a way of making the world a better place.</p>
<p><em>Postscript: A worthwhile read is <a href="http://rabbidmk.posterous.com/how-can-g-d-allow-natural-disasters" target="_blank">Rabbi Dov Kramer&#8217;s approach</a> which is very similar to what is written here just comes from a different direction.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/07/retraction-tim-tebow-ad-was-harmless-not-reckless/" target="_blank"><strong><span style="color: #993300;">UPDATE: RETRACTION AND APOLOGY HERE</span></strong></a></p>
<p>The most well-known athlete in America might be Tim Tebow.</p>
<p>Tebow is possibly the most celebrated, successful college football player of all time. He was a 2 time national champion with the Florida Gators and a Heisman Trophy winner. His success, as well as his  good looks and supernatural physique has made him a household name across the United States. Oh, there is one more thing, Tebow is the son of missionaries who is very religious and (at this point) celibate.</p>
<p>Tebow has used his star power to advocate for Christianity. He spent a couple of summers working with missionaries in the Far East and has always been vocal about his religiousness. Tim Tebow is an athlete who is using his star power to make a difference in the world. We may not agree with his message, but he is certainly a better role model than felon <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CEAQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2010%2F01%2F14%2FAR2010011403502.html&amp;ei=JMJhS5GMKpGksgPl5YWtCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQj1dgWYUUJBPZlV0jJbkt1RJElg&amp;sig2=NjTszozIJBn6w9LkB9eQ0A" target="_blank">Gilbert Arenas</a> or even <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/" target="_blank">LeBron James</a>.<span id="more-2067"></span></p>
<p>During the upcoming Super Bowl, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/tim-tebow-super-bowl-ad-cbs-air-controversial/story?id=9667638" target="_blank">Tebow will be featured in a $2.6 Million ad for a strong Pro-Life Organization called Focus on the Family</a>. This has set off a firestorm of reactions from groups that oppose Focus in the Famliy, like the National Organization for Women (don&#8217;t you love these names?) who do not approve the message of the ad. Additionally, advocate groups like PETA are up in arms because they have been denied Superbowl air time for their causes.</p>
<p>Honestly, the reason CBS approved this ad are probably related to the economy. IF you&#8217;re willing to pay $2.6 Million for an ad in the economy &#8211; they&#8217;ll take your money.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me about all this are the circumstances of Tim Tebow&#8217;s birth. In the ad Tim is expected to tell the story of his mother&#8217;s pregnancy. Mrs. Tebow became very ill during a mission to the Philippines and was advised to terminate the pregnancy to save her life. She ignored the doctor, Tim was born and Mrs. Tebow survived.</p>
<p>First, Jewish Law does not share the same views as Christian Law on abortion. In a situation where the mother&#8217;s life is in danger, many traditional authorities hold that  the mother MUST abort the pregnancy. There is an assumption that fundamentalist Christians and Orthodox Jews agree on abortion. That is just not true.</p>
<p>Second, even those that hold that abortion is immoral and should never be allowed, is this a wholesome message? To ignore a doctor&#8217;s strong recommendation? Isn&#8217;t reckless? Don&#8217;t we look at <a href="http://www.lisamcpherson.org/">Scientology</a> with disdain when a life is lost because of their refusal to see a doctor? What if Mrs. Tebow lost her life in the pregnancy and Tim dies before birth?</p>
<p>It seems that advocating for the sanctity of life is a fair cause to support, but advocating in a manner that breeds recklessness&#8230; That seems irresponsible.</p>

For Jewish snitches you can read <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/" target="_blank">my post on Mesira, the Jewish Informant</a>. Sneetches are a Dr. Seuss invention that teach us on of the simplest, yet profound lessons in bias, peer-pressure, segregation and of course capitalism. It is one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books.</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/11/the-good-wife-unorthodox-from-a-rabbi-law-student-perspective/" target="_blank">I wrote about the portrayal of chasidic Jews in The Good Wife</a>.</p>
<p>I cross-posted a portion of the post to <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2005/11/major-plot-hole-in-good-wife.html" target="_blank">DovBear</a> and a discussion developed about the nuanced differences within the Orthodox Jewish community. Different style hats, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah" target="_blank">kippas</a> and other subtle changes within each group exist and commenter <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/dovbear/7709359621451818593/?src=hsr#532605" target="_blank">G*3</a> thinks that these differences are like the differences between the sneetches.</p>
<p>I disagree.<span id="more-1673"></span></p>
<p>For those of you that are unfamiliar with the story I have copied the Wikipedia summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="color: #000080;">Sneetches are a group of vaguely avian yellow creatures who live on a beach. Some Sneetches have a green star on their bellies, and in the beginning of the story the absence of a star is the basis for </span><a style="text-decoration: none; background-image: none; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: initial;" title="Discrimination" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"><span style="color: #000080;">discrimination</span></a><span style="color: #000080;">. Sneetches who have stars on their bellies are part of the &#8220;in crowd&#8221;, while Sneetches without stars are </span><a style="text-decoration: none; background-image: none; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: initial;" title="Elitism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitism"><span style="color: #000080;">shunned</span></a><span style="color: #000080;"> and consequently mopey.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="color: #000080;">In the story, a &#8220;fix-it-up chappie&#8221; named Sylvester McMonkey McBean appears, driving a cart of strange machines. He offers the Sneetches without stars a chance to have them by going through his Star-On machine, for three dollars. The treatment is instantly popular, but this upsets the original star-bellied Sneetches, as they are in danger of losing their method for discriminating between Sneetches. Then McBean tells them about his Star-Off machine, costing ten dollars. The Sneetches formerly with stars happily pay the money to have them removed in order to remain special.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="color: #000080;">However, McBean does not share the prejudices of the Sneetches, and allows the recently starred Sneetches through this machine as well. Ultimately this escalates, with the Sneetches running from one machine to the next,</span></p>
<dl style="margin-top: 0.2em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
<dd style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.1em;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8220;until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew</span></dd>
<dd style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.1em;"><span style="color: #000080;">whether this one was that one or that one was this one</span></dd>
<dd style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.1em;"><span style="color: #000080;">or which one was what one&#8230; or what one was who.&#8221;</span></dd>
</dl>
<p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="color: #000080;">This continues until the Sneetches are penniless and McBean departs a rich man, amused by their folly. Despite his assertion that &#8220;you can&#8217;t teach a Sneetch,&#8221; the Sn</span><span style="color: #000080;">eetches learn from this experience that neither plain-belly nor star-belly Sneetches are superior, and they are able to get along and become friends.</span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sneetches_and_Other_Stories" target="_blank">&#8211; Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">The reason Sneetches are not the same as different kippas in the Orthodox Jewish community is because there was <em>nothing actually different</em> about the sneetches with stars or without stars. They were the exact same creatures with one <em>external difference</em>. This is true of humanity. We are all the same on the inside to an extent, we tend to think the outside means a whole lot, when really it does not mean anything. That is the lesson of the Sneetches.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">Within groups however, there are cultural, social and even theological differences. Sometimes an external symbol is used to show that <em>there are nuanced differences that are meaningful</em>. Like a chasidic Jew will dress differently from another Orthodox Jew because he does a different culture and slightly different theology. The external symbol only demonstrates that he is different. It is <em>not the defining difference</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">The Sneetches only difference was their stars or lack-thereof. Within cultural sub-groups there may be real, meaningful differences. It is okay for them to show these differences by dressing or acting differently. So long as we don&#8217;t give meaning to the external factor we can even point out the differences. Once we start to think the external difference actually means something, then we get into a Sneetches problem.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">I think the subtle differences are good. They help people find other people with similar culture, social and theological sensitivities as themselves. It would be a travesty to <em>limit oneself </em>to people who are exactly the same as they are, but external differences don&#8217;t cause that. <em>Foolish people</em> cause that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1571 alignleft" title="Santa Monica Pier" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/WA66SantaMonicaPier.jpg?resize=240%2C160" alt="Santa Monica Pier" data-recalc-dims="1" />We took the family to Santa Monica Pier on Sunday and our six year old son proved to be smarter than a Supreme Court Justice!</p>
<p>It is so beautiful to walk along the beach and observe all the excitement along the boardwalk and pier. As always, we had a great time in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>For the last few years there has been a protest / exhibit just north of the pier. The protestors are against war in general, the Iraq war in specific and pretty much the entire defense budget of the United States.</p>
<p>They call it <a href="http://www.arlingtonwestsantamonica.org/" target="_blank">Arlington West</a> and they have set up a faux graveyard in the sand representing the fallen soldiers in what they call a criminal war.<span id="more-1568"></span></p>
<p>It can be quite powerful when you see it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1570" title="Arlington West" src="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_0357.jpg?resize=640%2C480" alt="Arlington West" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As we walked by the lines and lines of crosses on this occasion, my 6 year old son asks, &#8220;How do they know all the soldiers who died were Christian? If they were Jewish or Muslim or &#8216;nothing&#8217; they probably wouldn&#8217;t want a cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>Excellent point kiddo! Score one for the six year old.</p>
<p>In fact you may have heard about this exact issue arising in the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Salazar v. Buono</em>. The issue in the case is an eight-foot high cross that was erected as a memorial to fallen soldiers in foreign wars.</p>
<p>The case made recent headlines when Justice Scalia could not fathom that a non-Christian would perhaps be offended by a Christian symbol as a memorial for the dead. The exchange between Justice Scalia and ACLU lawyer Peter J. Eliasburg went something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>JUSTICE SCALIA: The cross doesn&#8217;t honor non-Christians who fought in the war? Is that &#8212; is that &#8212;</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: I believe that&#8217;s actually correct.</em></p>
<p><em>JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does it say that?</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: It doesn&#8217;t say that, but a cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to redeem mankind for our sins, and I believe that&#8217;s why the Jewish war veterans &#8212;</em></p>
<p><em>JUSTICE SCALIA: It&#8217;s erected as a war memorial. I assume it is erected in honor of all of the war dead. It&#8217;s the &#8212; the cross is the &#8212; is the most common symbol of &#8212; of &#8212; of the resting place of the dead, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to me &#8212; what would you have them erect? A cross &#8212; some conglomerate of a cross, a Star of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and star?</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, if I may go to your first point. The cross is the most common symbol of the resting place of Christians. I have been in Jewish cemeteries. There is never a cross on a tombstone of a Jew. (Laughter.)</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: So it is the most common symbol to honor Christians.</em></p>
<p><em>JUSTICE SCALIA: I don&#8217;t think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead. I think that&#8217;s an outrageous conclusion.</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: Well, my &#8212; the point of my &#8212; point here is to say that there is a reason the Jewish war veterans came in and said we don&#8217;t feel honored by this cross. This cross can&#8217;t honor us because it is a religious symbol of another religion.</em></p>

<p>What amazes me is how my 6 year old son can see something so patently obvious and yet Justice Scalia can&#8217;t seem to process the concept&#8230;</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>

For a non-partisan blog that is a lot.</p>
<p>But once again, it would be impossible to ignore this elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Optimistic at best presumptuous at worse, President Obama&#8217;s recent Nobel Peace Prize award really pushes the envelope of credibilty.<span id="more-1372"></span></p>
<p>I am pretty much in 100% agreement with two of my favorite bloggers on this one so I will link to their posts.</p>
<p>DovBear nails it (as nearly always) and is most worried that <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/10/barrys-prize.html" target="_blank">the Nobel Peace Prize has been transformed into a political stunt</a>.</p>
<p>Conversations in Klal writes about the real (wrong) lesson here, that <a href="http://conversationsinklal.blogspot.com/2009/10/hell-of-carrot.html" target="_blank">we can be rewarded for promises with no results</a>.</p>
<p>My thoughts are along the same lines as both.</p>
<p>First, is this prize even worth anything anymore?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t a mandatory annual award cheapened by the fact that it must be awarded yearly with no regard for it being deserved? Doesn&#8217;t sound very meaningful to me.</p>
<p>My proposal is that when someone earns the award, give it to them. But don&#8217;t force-feed the public a manufactered awardee purely for the sake of awarding the prize. If no-one wins, no-one gets the prize.</p>
<p>Second, I am really concerned with the lesson being taught. Prizes must be earned. I wrote about this a while back when I wrote about a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/15/winners-and-losers-a-new-yorker-cartoon-and-i-get-it-and-it-is-funny/" target="_blank">great cartoon in the New Yorker</a>. It is symptomatic of our generation that we reward prematurely and place people on pedestals before they have climbed atop the pedestal on their own.</p>
<p>We should allow things to progress organically and give projects time to breath and develop.</p>
<p>Patience is a virtue. It is time to put patience back in our society.</p>

<p>Please read both and if you are able to help in any way possible, it is much appreciated.</p>
<p>One great thing about blogging is the opportunity to connect with other people for the sake of an important cause. Today, I present you with two important causes.<span id="more-1120"></span></p>
<p>First, there is a blogger who writes vitriolic, hate laced blog posts against anyone with whom he disagrees. He does so under the guise of Authentic Judaism. He makes no real arguments, just yells loudly at those he views as a threat (read: anyone who thinks differently than he). Apparently, he thinks that God spoke to him directly and gave him Torah and nobody else. A number of bloggers are trying to snatch the Google search result ranking from his blog.</p>
<p>I am here to help.</p>
<p>More importantly, DovBear is looking for some kind souls to help a family in desperate financial need. The economic downturn has claimed some more victims and from what I understand, their situation is dire. It is really easy to help, <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Just click here and click donate in the upper right hand sidebar</a> and donate just a little money. Type in the amount you can give and indicate it is for <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23familyneedsdough" target="_blank">#famliyneedsdough</a>. If you can give just a few dollars it would make a tremendous difference to this family. Every penny donated will be given directly to the needy family.</p>
<p>I appreciate any relief you can provide.</p>

<p><em><span style="color: #808080;">What follows is my understanding of The Oral Law and its transmission to us. This article does not attempt to validate or prove its transmission as fact, rather it explains just what is being transmitted when we refer to Torah SheBaal Peh (TSBP).</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #808080;">I am sure there are plenty of maamarei Chazal that are not 100% congruent with this approach. I am also sure that there are many maamarei Chazal that do jive with this approach. I have spent many hours studying and analyzing the concept of TSBP and what follows is what I believe to be a rational, coherent, non-apologetic approach.<span id="more-1108"></span><br />
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #808080;">Much of this essay is accessible<span style="color: #808080;"> in </span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/18/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-3-connections-5409/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #808080;">audio format by clicking here</span></a><span style="color: #808080;">.</span></span></em></p>
<p>The Torah preceded the world. One tradition tell us that God looked into the Torah and created the world. That means that the Torah contains within it the spiritual genetic code of the world and the world is a physical manifestation of that code. Another metaphor would be a blueprint. All the information necessary to build is in the blueprint, yet it is merely ink and paper. What can this mean? God looked at the stories of Adam and Eve and created the world? Or God looked at the sale of Joseph and created the word? Impossible. The metaphor does not even make sense. I believe Chazal are telling us that Torah is not the stories or even laws in the Chumash. &#8220;Torah&#8221; refers to the all encompassing Oral Law (this idea is attributed to Rambam). In other words, the Oral Law refers to the natural and supernatural rules of the universe that manifested themselves in a physical sense once God put them into motion during &#8220;Creation&#8221;.</p>
<p>What this means is that the Torah and our universe are really two sides of one coin. The spiritual code on one side and the physical manifestation on the other side. Thus, someone could potentially rewrite the spiritual code by examining the physical manifestation side. Just as with a blueprint, a talented architect could possibly rewrite a blueprint by examining a building a talented spiritualist would be capable of figuring out the spiritual code the world is made of.</p>
<p>This spiritual code contains within it the natural rules of our universe and some of those rules are recommended limitations on human activity designed to help a person maximize their existence in the world. In this light, the Torah is a guide that gives the physical world its characteristics and contains the instructions for living in that world.</p>
<p>A few individuals were in tune with this reality and implemented some of the Torah&#8217;s concepts into their lives. Shem, Ever, Noach and Enosh were a few of the first people who were able to glean spiritual rules from their observations of the world.</p>
<p>Abraham was the first to grasp enough of the code for God to choose him to begin a nation of people to whom God would eventually charge with keeping and teaching this code. Slowly, Abraham taught these concepts to whomever would listen. The Abrahamic family was also aware of these Torah rules and whether they kept them or not is not relevant. They knew them and may have practiced them.</p>
<p>Upon Abraham&#8217;s family being enslaved in Egypt, the concepts and their rules became more and more forgotten. The exodus occurred just before the point of no return. The point that Chazal call the 49th level of impurity. The slaves were just as Egyptian as their slave-masters save for 3 (or 4) areas. Such, a large nation of people would need a guide book to remind them of their Abrahamic, monotheistic, Torah tradition. The Bnei Yisrael left Egypt for the sole purpose of receiving these instructions in the form of the Torah.</p>
<p>At Sinai, God gave Moses the entire code. This code included the spiritual rules, the laws, the stories (which all contain important moral and quasi-historical lessons) as well as all the information necessary to live according to those laws. God then gave Moses a written version of notes to this code. These notes were the bare minimum necessary to reconstruct the entire code as God gave it to Moses.</p>
<p>At this point, Moses has all the information in his head and gives the people this written book of notes that we call the Written Law or Torah SheBiksav (TSBK). As time progresses Moses added (probably divinely inspired) notes to the end of the TSBK to complete the books. The Jewish people try to live a lifestyle as Moses taught them according to the code and had the notes in TSBK to help them remember their obligations. As we are taught at the start of Ethics of our Fathers, Moses &#8220;kibbel&#8221; (received) the &#8220;Torah&#8221; (including the TSBP) (and again this does not mean the Chumash, why would there need to be a mesora for that if it was written) and gave it all to Joshua, who gave it to the elders etc. There was a central Torah authority who could resolve disputes. Originally, it was a one man show starring Moses. But at the behest of Jethro, some delegation gave Torah authority to others. There was no machlokes (disagreement) among the Torah authority as Moses could always be consulted to give them the truth.</p>
<p>The system was designed to ensure that there would be a transmission from parent to child and teacher to student. This guaranteed the Torah would remain a &#8220;living&#8221; Torah and not relegated to a library. Codifying the bare minimum in text form forced the Jewish people to rely on a system of relationships and living the life of Torah to remember all its laws. This is an integral part of the Oral Transmission that has stood the test of time, as we shall see.</p>
<p>This system remained in place throughout the 1st Temple. A central Torah authority was the final arbiter of disputes and there was no machlokes as to what Moses claimed God wanted the Jewish people to do in their service of God.</p>
<p>Many called this entire concept into question. Korach, Yeravam and others wished to undermine the Mosaic Torah authority. But it always existed.</p>
<p>During the Second Temple, due to oppression it was literally impossible to maintain a central Torah authority. Torah study was banned, Torah scholars were killed and Yeshivas were disbanded. Students began taking notes to ensure TSBP would be remembered.</p>
<p>In a revolutionary move, Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi collected many of these notebooks and canonized a version of TSBP notes called the Mishna. He too, followed the Mosaic formula of writing just the bare minimum necessary for a scholar to recreate the code from the Mishna. He wrote the Mishnayos in a format that would induce questions and those questions would in turn produce the TSBP tradition. He was successful to an extent. But due to the increased hostility and lack of central Torah authority disputes were common. R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi completely succeeded in the broader goal of maintaining the need for the parent to child, teacher to student relationship to transmit TSBP.</p>
<p>Mishnaic literature was discussed, argued and taught for a couple hundred years. Students continued taking notes and eventually these notes became the Talmud. Ravina and Rav Ashi collected these notes and recorded these conversations to canonize the understanding of the Mishna in order to recreate the entire code. Although to a lesser degree, they also made an effort to be concise and include only the discussion necessary for recreating the method of Jewish life briefly described in the Mishna that was based on the written notes of the Chumash that God gave to Moses. Their brevity, once again maintained the familiar generation to generation connection that TSBP demands.</p>
<p>Since the closing of the Talmud it has been discussed and argued vociferously. This is a good thing. It gives its scholars the chance they need to arrive at the truth. TSBP is not their discussions, it is what they are discussing. TSBP was given to the Jewish people at Sinai but in truth it exists all around us. It is the rules of nature and spirituality that govern our world. Distant cultures and tribes can come to similar conclusions as the Torah because they are examining the world that is the physical manifestation of that Torah. People who never heard of Torah can relate to many of its laws as they seem natural to them. In fact they are natural to the world.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when we say that Moses received Torah SheBaal Peh, what we mean is that Moses had all the information necessary to live and appreciate the Torah lifestyle. The Written Torah were the original notes to this information as time progresses, we now have Mishanic and Talmudic notes as well. Thus, our study of Talmud today continues the Oral Transmission of TSBP as we attempt to decode the original version of the Oral Law handed from God to Moses on Sinai. Today, our greatest resource to that end is the study of Talmud.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back I contributed a <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/anonymous-vs-onymous-blogging.html" target="_blank">decent post to DovBear</a> that generated an <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/dovbear/5867413693300232675/" target="_blank">impressive response from legions of commenters</a> on DovBear. The post was a comparison of anonymous vs. <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/onymous" target="_blank">onymous</a> blogging.</p>
<p>I argued that by blogging about important things anonymously, they are less effective and only perpetuate the near censorship of right-wing Orthodox Judaism. Some went on to call anonymous blogging cowardly.</p>
<p>In the discussion that ensued I conceded that quite possibly, better conversation can be had anonymously and I admitted that for a blog like DovBear, the unfortunate reality is that anonymity is the preferable choice.</p>
<p>Something left undiscussed was the reality that DovBear is not anonymous. Google, who hosts his blog, knows exactly who he is, where he lives and presumably, has access to all his email, searches and web history. Until a few days ago, one may have assumed that their information was safe with Google.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p><span id="more-1025"></span><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=8359356" target="_blank">A New York State Supreme Court ruled</a> that Google was compelled to reveal the identity of a blogger using Google&#8217;s Blogger software. The blogger is question had posted defamatory comments about a fashion model that negatively affected her career. The model sued Google to uncloak the anonymous blogger and the court held that Google must comply.</p>
<p>Some may think I herald this as a victory for onymous blogging. Not so. If one is not comfortable blogging onymously his privacy must be respected. I urge people to <em>choose</em> to blog onymously, I am not on favor of <em>mandating</em> it and banning anonymous blogging.</p>
<p>The Bray of Fundie has an interesting post about his opinion on the ramifications of this ruling which is worth reading. <a href="http://innate-differences.blogspot.com/2009/08/defamation-of-masks.html" target="_blank">Click here to go to to his excellent blog called HaMavdil</a>.</p>
<p>(This is just one more reason to self host one&#8217;s blog. Technically the owner of a Blogger blog is Google and it is their information to share or withhold. A self hosted blog cannot be &#8220;outed&#8221; by Google as the blog owner is the rights holder to the information on the blog.)</p>
<p>But what of the courts decision? How does this affect the blogosphere? Some are calling it the &#8220;end of anonymous blogging&#8221;. That may very well be the case, but a new anonymous medium (twitter?) will crop up and still give voice to the anony-addicts out there. So really, the voice of the anonymous will not be quelled it will just need to move its home base.</p>
<p>The prospect of Google sharing our information is more worrisome than anything else. Everything we do is being recorded by Google. That can seem very scary.</p>
<p>Yet, when we reflect on this idea we can ask ourselves, is it so strange to us that our lives are being recorded by Google? Is it such a foreign concept that our every movement has meaning and does not disappear into the oblivion of infinite time and space?</p>
<p>Of course it is not. Our Rabbis teach us &#8220;V&#8217;chol ma&#8217;asecha b&#8217;sefer nichtavim&#8221;. All our actions are recorded in a &#8220;book&#8221;. Obviously, this cannot be a real, leather-bound volume published by Harper-Collins. I understsand this to mean that each of our actions has cosmic ramifications. Whenever we act, it affects us and the world is affected. None of our actions are meaningless that they would go &#8220;unrecorded&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is what Elul and the High Holidays are about. Realizing that our decisions and choices make real differences and hopefully adjusting our lives accordingly to make good and true choices.</p>
<p>The court decision in favor of the fashion model comes at a great time. We can take stock and learn a lesson about what it means for our lives to &#8220;recorded&#8221;; what it means to live life with the understanding that everything we do matters.</p>
<p>At some point we all will need to face our life&#8217;s choices. Let&#8217;s make the right choices.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear &#8211; <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/08/mesira-informant-in-jewish-law.html" target="_blank">more discussion there</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p>The topic of mesira is complex. I do not claim expertise on the subject of who is a moser, but I have heard a discourse from an expert on Jewish and American Law named <a href="http://www.wsat.org/therav.htm" target="_blank">Rabbi Breitowitz</a>. Aside from teaching law at University of Maryland, Rabbi Breitowitz is a practicing Rabbi in Silver Spring Maryland. When I lived in Baltimore, I heard Rabbi Breitowitz speak on the topic of mesira and I was able to find the same speech online to refresh my memory.</p>
<p>This is my basic understanding of his take on mesira.<span id="more-1000"></span></p>
<p>He mentions three contemporary positions, Reb Moshe Feinstein, the Aruch HaShulchan and Rav Wosner.</p>
<p>He begins with Reb Moshe. Reb Moshe holds that there is a prohibition of mesira when the secular punishment is worse than the Torah&#8217;s punishment. A moser has a halachic status of a rodef, one who is trying to kill another, and must be stopped from his mesira. There are 3 big exceptions. 1) When the person about whom the moser is speaking of is a rodef himself. This is because a person who kills a rodef is not a killer nor is his act of attempting to kill the rodef is not considered a rodef. As an aside, a sexual or physical abuser is considered a halachic rodef and thus there is no prohibition of mesira in those situations. 2) If the moser is preventing a major communal disaster then there is no prohibition. 3) If it one&#8217;s job to inform, then mesira will not apply.</p>
<p>This is the most narrow view of when one is permitted to be moser that Rabbi Breitowitz mentions.</p>
<p>The Aruch Hashulchan says in a footnote to section 318 in Choshen Mishpat that in a benevolent and fair country where there is a justice system that does not unfairly imprison Jews, one is not guilty of mesira by informing the government of a fellow Jew&#8217;s crimes. He continues by saying &#8220;for example in wonderful Czarist Russia&#8221;. There is a question as to the seriousness of this footnote as he could not have possibly meant that Czarist Russia was fair and benevolent. The question is whether the entire footnote has value or if the entire thing was a false gesture of good faith to the Czar. It is not likely that the Aruch Hashulchan would add a deliberately misleading footnote and the reasoning of his footnote stands whether his country was wonderful or not. Thus, the Tzitz Eliezer holds that the Aruch Hashulchan means that wherever there is a &#8220;procedural justice&#8221; there is no mesira.</p>
<p>The third opinion is that of Rav Wosner. His approach integrates the rules of dina d&#8217;malchusa dina with mesira. His reasoning is that when the non-Jews follow the Noachide law of creating a set of laws it becomes a halachic basis for the Jew to obey those laws. Thus, he concludes that it cannot be possible to violate the prohibition of mesira if one is following the laws of their country. Since, he must follow the laws of that country his mesira is not against halacha. This does not mean one is required to be a moser, rather the reporting is not a violation of mesira.</p>
<p>It is necessary to define when dina d&#8217;milchusa dina constitutes to determine when mesira is not prohibited according to Rav Wosner. The Mechaber says that dina d&#8217;malchusa dina is limited to government interests. The Rama disagrees and says that it applies to anything that is designed to promote the well being of society. Most poskim agree with this definition which includes but is not limited to, criminal law, minimum wage laws, environmental laws and child labor laws.</p>
<p>In conclusion, mesira is a term bandied about to protect our own criminals. In reality, it is very difficult to pin down a halachic moser according to the Aruch Hashulchan or Rav Wosner and although it is possible according to Reb Moshe to be a moser it is still unlikely. We need to be honest with ourselves and stop hiding behind archaic halachic terms to justify false ideas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear &#8211; <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/scamming-government-and-scamming-god.html" target="_blank">more discussion there</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p>The newswires have been full reporting the massive scandal in NY / NJ the last few days. There is a strong correlation between the scandal and something prevalent in contemporary Orthodox Jewish society.</p>
<p>You may think you are far from a money-laundering, tax evading, kidney-dealing, FBI snitching, tax-evading, &#8220;knucklehead&#8221;. You may even be have the cleanest books on Wall Street and third party audits to prove it. Yet, our entire generation is infected with the same virus that the &#8220;knucklehead&#8221; are carrying.</p>
<p><span id="more-919"></span>The instant gratification / no effort, big payoff virus. (Yeah, I know, the name needs work, help me out in the comments.)</p>
<p>We, as a group are all looking for shortcuts. For some folks, the shortcuts are business shortcuts. Those are the &#8220;knuckleheads&#8221; who are going to jail. For others, the shortcuts are in the form of Jewish Magic (sometimes known as Segulos).</p>
<p>We have become overly reliant on the practice of Segulos. We want instant answers, we want instant gratification, we want an incantation to make things better, we want protection from evil all with minimal effort.</p>
<p>(There may be a place for Segulos in Judaism. What irks me is the proliferation of pop-Segulos. I may have mentioned this with regard to Kupat Ha&#8217;ir as well.)</p>
<p>Case in point: The Brachos Party (aka the Amen Party). Women (usually younger women) gather on a weekday evening. A little bit of food from each of the Brachos categories are brought to the table, beginning with some grape juice and ending with a jelly bean. Prior to each blessing a kabbalistic interpretation is provided including ideas like &#8220;making a mezonos will provide parnasa&#8221; and &#8220;making a haetz will bring children&#8221;. Then the blessing is made, a resounding amen is heard. People really do this. I am not kidding.</p>
<p>There also less formal, impromptu amen parties. Like in a summer camp, when everyone goes to wash netilas yadayim, girls calls over all of their friends (waiting for them to come, motioning and making a halachic hefsek) so they can hear her blessing and say amen.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty harmless, right? I disagree.</p>
<p>This is another shortcut.</p>
<p>Chazal reported that there are special benefits to a blessing and an amen recited properly. The point of this is to remind us to take our blessings seriously and to constantly include God in our physical lives. In fact this is a main theme throughout Torah. We are physical beings with the ability to transform the mundane into the sublime by our actions. One of the beautiful parts of Judaism is the constant tension and connection between our physical and spiritual existence. Blessings are a major part of that connection.</p>
<p>By relegating blessings to magic tricks, we lose the whole point of the blessing.</p>
<p>Further, the Aruch HaShulchan writes that one may not use &#8220;tricks&#8221; to get to the 100 blessing a day threshold mentioned in halacha. It must come organically. Additionally, he writes, saying amen to an &#8220;unnecessary blessing&#8221; is a terrible thing to do. These are not &#8220;unnecessary blessings&#8221; but a random drink of grape juice on a Wednesday, purely for the sake of making a blessing is awfully close.</p>
<p>When challenged, an &#8220;on the fence Brachos Party participant&#8221; told me that she learned that the whole reason we eat is to make blessings, so it is harmless to make more.</p>
<p>That really got me. The reason we eat is to live. When we are eating to live we make blessings. This integrates spirituality into our physical life as stated above. Further, the food &#8220;belongs to God&#8221;, making a blessing gives us the right to enjoy His world as per His instructions to us.</p>
<p>Eating so we make brachos is like going to the bathroom so we can make an Asher Yatzar. We go to the bathroom because otherwise we would burst. When we go successfully we acknowledge and thank God.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an idea. When you are done eating and drinking at the brachos party, go make an Asher Yatzar party!</p>
<p>I truly believe this is another symptom of the instant gratification / no effort, big payoff virus. We want to reap the benefits of the blessing so we invent ways to try and get those benefits.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t work like that. There are no freebies in Judaism. Judaism is about working hard to follow the Mitzvos and refine one&#8217;s character. If the bored women want to do something to help the world, volunteer at Tomche Shabbos or homeless shelter, or go to a Torah class, or even say some Tehillim.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t fool God. You can try and scam the government, you can try and scam your business associates and you will probably get caught or turned in, but please do not try and scam God.</p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<div><span style="color:#336666;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/guest-pos-t-by-e.html" target="_blank"><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear &#8211; more discussion there.</em></a></strong></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/35376/2009/07/21/jerusalem-religious-large-families-are-joy-ignore-the-evil-feminist-anti-motherhood-terror/">An article on Ynet.com featured on VIN caught my ire this afternoon.</a></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">The writer, a woman, calls upon all Orthodox Jews to reject &#8220;the evil feminists&#8221; of Kolech and &#8220;have as many children as possible, as soon as possible&#8221;. For there is no greater joy in life than having many children.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Her arguments are weak (read it for yourself) and the ending says it all: &#8220;Trust me&#8221;. Why should I trust her?</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">As a proud father of 2 beautiful boys (a 6 year old and 8 month old) I can attest to the joys of parenthood. Giving the gift of life to one&#8217;s offspring is both very powerful and oftentimes emotional. I cannot imagine my life without my family.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">I must take issue with this woman&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;the greatest gift we can give our families is a big family. Very big&#8221;.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><span id="more-888"></span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">In the VIN comments, there is a quote from R&#8217; Shlomo Zalman Aurbach. When approached with a shaila regarding a woman who had 6 children and suffered a nervous breakdown for a heter to use birth control. His response, &#8220;why are you asking me, ask the Rav who gave her a heter to have 6 children in the first place!?&#8221;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Reb Moshe Feinstein writes in his Tshuvos that if the mother would suffer any physical, psychological or emotional harm from bearing more children she must use birth control.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><span style="font-style:italic;"></p>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Having a large family is not rooted in halacha. It is rooted in a social pressure to conform.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<p></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">What has happened is the children of the &#8220;survivors&#8221; and that generation had a social calling to have large families. They were able to bear it (for the most part) with a low cost of living and 9-5 jobs, leaving time and money to spare. Enough to support many of those children in Kollel.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">For many people pregnancy and childbirth as well as child rearing are difficult. For many families the cost of living is too high to support a large family. Work hours are long and the money does not go as far as it used to go.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Today&#8217;s society requires different approaches to life&#8217;s challenges from previous generations. The cost of living is higher. This forces most families to need a dual income. Who is going to raise these large families? What about the marriages? Husbands and wives who work full time, come home tired with children who need their time and attention. The idea of marriage in Judaism is to develop a relationship with a significant other. This cannot be ignored either!</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Our schools are suffering from unprecedented deficits and budget cutting. Parents are having a hard time paying the tuition bills. Large families may be all of &#8220;your joy&#8221; but they can be an unfair burden on the tzibbur.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">I am not calling for a &#8220;child cap&#8221; ala China. I am saying use your sechel and please don&#8217;t tell me what is good for you is good for everyone. Please don&#8217;t preach to me about what you think is right when it is not based on halacha.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Bitachon does not allow for recklessness. We cannot overburden ourselves or the system and expect bitachon to bail us out. There are children of large families who I know resented the lack of attention they received, the handouts they needed and the hustle and bustle of their busy homes. Those parents were likely ill equipped to deal with the large family dynamics and their children felt it.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Also, I happen to think that there are folks who have lots of kids to distract themselves from their unhappy lives, or their unhappy marriages (yes like a drug). Those folks need help. Not bigger families.</span></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This post is cross-posted to <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a> &#8211; more discussion there</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I read an important column on a good website yesterday.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t on NYTimes.com or Yahoo.com or ESPN.com (some of my favorite sites to link from) this article was on <a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/" target="_blank">Vosizneias.com</a>. VIN is a Orthodox Jewish blog with editorials and news. I recommend checking it out when you have a chance.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/35083/2009/07/15/new-york-baalei-teshuva-turned-off-by-e2809cfrume2809d-people-engaging-in-corrupt-behavior/" target="_blank"> column I read was a great perpective on Baal Teshuvas</a> and their integration into the Frum community. In particular the column focused on various reactions of the BT (I use the term adoringly) when encountered with other (supposedly) Frum Jews who are not living up to their own standards.</p>
<p><span id="more-872"></span>Some BTs &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmNopAo0PRc&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">can&#8217;t handle the truth</a>&#8221; and wind up right where they started &#8211; wonderful secular people. Other BTs are more adept at maintaining their Frum lifestyle despite the disappointment. The article then enumerates some of the great things that BTs have contributed to the Frum lifestyle. Like manners, healthy eating, special education, etc.</p>
<p>While there is room for debate on whether the Frum community can attribute these &#8220;innovations&#8221; to BTs I am happy to give them the credit.</p>
<p>The article concludes by thanking the Frum community for showing them a way of life they love and appreciate.</p>
<p>I have two main points that I want to make in relation to this article.</p>
<p>1- The fake sales pitch the Frum From Birth Kiruv Rabbis spew.</p>
<p>2- The BTs reaction to the reality check.</p>
<p>I cannot stand the sales pitch that Frum people have no problems and Torah life is free from all social ills. It is simply not accurate. Please don&#8217;t use it!</p>
<p>In fact, the Torah is a guidebook for flawed people. If people were able to just become perfect then the Torah would give us one time instructions to &#8220;fix&#8221; our flaws and then we would be good to go! But instead, the Torah gives us instructions to develop our character through Mitzva observance with specific tasks. Some tasks only come around once in a lifetime, or once every 50 years, or once every seven years, or once a year, or once a month, once a week, once a day, and even every second. The clear message is that we need constant work because humans will eventually fall.</p>
<p>The Talmud explicitly states: &#8220;Do not believe in yourself (righteousness) until the day you die&#8221;. The human being is designed to fail without constant work and guidance.</p>
<p>I believe the honest sales pitch (and yes it is a sales pitch and that&#8217;s okay) is: Humans are flawed, we all need guidance, the Torah provides guidance. Some of it is obvious, some of it is hidden, but we believe that the Torah lifestyle is a guide for life. If you want a guide, you can buy in. We are all trying to use the guide as best as we can and we feel our lives are more enriched by using the guide. Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important is the reaction of the BT. I sent this email to <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/juddmag" target="_blank">Judd Magilnick</a>, a<a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank"> Pacific Jewish Center</a> board member and he offered some great insight.</p>
<p>First, many &#8220;not yet&#8221; BTs back off from greater commitment by rationalizing that they saw a Frum person who lacked derech eretz (common courtesy). Judd says this is the Yetzer Hara talking but Frum folks need to realize that they are being judged and should act accordingly.</p>
<p>I once heard that R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein asked why we ask in Ahava Rabba that Hashem give us the ability to understand, listen to and teach Torah. Should the teaching part be reserved for teachers and rabbis? Why does veryone say it? And R&#8217; Moshe answers that we are all teachers. We are teaching others about how the Torah wants us to behave every time we act.</p>
<p>Judd&#8217;s next point was even better. Why should an impious Frum person affect one&#8217;s opinion of Torah? The analogy is if one sticks his wet finger in a socket he is going to get a shock. That doesn&#8217;t indicate a flaw in elecricity! And like electricity Torah has the power to do great good and it also has the power to cause ill. It depends on its user.</p>
<p>So (potential) BTs, if you can use Torah for good why would you let it bother you that someone else is abusing it? One has nothing to do with the other!</p>
<p>As a Rabbi in shul of mostly BTs and potential BTs I hear this kind of rhetoric often. &#8220;If he&#8217;s a Frum person he shouldn&#8217;t do X or Y etc&#8221;. It is disheartening but I have one response.</p>
<p>I always quote Rabbi Wein: &#8220;Don&#8217;t judge Judaism by its Jews&#8221;.</p>
<p>Additionally, I don&#8217;t <em>pitch</em> anything other that learning more Torah and experiencing a Shabbos meal. One should make their personal decisions based on an informed view that can only come from one&#8217;s own study. The Shabbos meal is just to make it a little more personal and less abstract. That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>So, I am looking for insight, do people really judge Torah by its Jews?</p>
<p>Is there an &#8220;accurate&#8221; (non-cynical) sales pitch?</p>
<p>Anything else in the original column that struck you?</p>

On Thursday my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a><img style="border: none!important; margin: 0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00262OUR4" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> arrived at my summer residence and I was hoping to look it over on Shabbos.</p>
<p>At just over 175 pages I thought I would peruse the articles and formulate a general opinion of the book over Shabbos. Instead, I was so tired by the time Shabbos came along I decided to just read the first couple of chapters before heading to bed Friday night.</p>
<p>To my surprise I was unsuccessful in my goal&#8230; I started the book after the Friday night meal and I went to sleep at 11:30 PM, after I had read the entire book cover to cover (not just the first couple chapters). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is a true page turner.<span id="more-825"></span></p>
<p>I was spellbound and mesmerized. As I was reading I felt myself running through the full gamut of emotions. The book made me laugh, cry, agree, disagree, shake my head, nod my head, upset, happy, disappointed, thrilled and thirsty for more.</p>
<p>Before I begin the substantive review, I would be remiss if I did not mention that I found the dedication and acknowledgements sweet and honest. It was not contrived as some cheesy dedications are and it only added to the power of the book. The book certainly starts on the right foot.</p>
<p>First, allow me to say, the book demonstrates DovBear&#8217;s tremendous breadth of Torah knowledge. The sheer number of Torah commentaries, Midrashim, Talmudic passages and contemporary opinions presented represents a life&#8217;s work devoted to understanding and appreciating Torah.</p>
<p>Too many of us &#8220;punch in&#8221; at the local Daf Yomi instead of &#8220;tuning in&#8221; to our learning. This book demonstrates the latter.</p>
<p>Second, the insights are impeccable. I found myself time and time again wishing that I had thought of what I was reading. Much of it seems so obvious and yet elusive to the average observant Jew.</p>
<p>In particular the observations made in &#8220;Eliezer and his 318 Men is obviously the correct reading of the material and yet I have never heard it before! Perhaps, I would have seen it myself in the original text down the road, but the way DovBear seemlessly integrates the words of the commentaries with the Torah gives life and a spark to the commentaries quoted.Similarly, the sentiment expressed in &#8220;What Was Rivka Playing At&#8221; and &#8220;Esav Enigma&#8221; is something I talk about often but is foreign to many learned Jews.</p>
<p>A clarity of thought and of writing makes some difficult concepts more palatable and easier to appreciate. But the depth of the content is not compromised by its simple tone. Each short essay (almost each essay) provides deeper insight into some of the most complex sections of the Chumash. Such as, the story of Tamar, Yaakov stealing the Blessings from Esav, the curse of Cham, the sin of the Spies and the first Shabbos violator.</p>
<p>Third, the aesthetics of the typography and layout is pleasing. So often a book is well written but so hard to read because of the obvious lack of attention paid to the reader&#8217;s eyes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is easy to read linguistically and physically.</p>
<p>Next, the essays. Many essays were outstanding. My overall favorites (I could be missing a few) are: Rainbows, The Curse of Ham, A Twenty First Century Sodom?, Why Was Isaac Blind?, Salt and Straw, Marrying Sisters, Leah&#8217;s Lament, Esav Sonei L&#8217;Yaakov, Tamar&#8217;s Tale, Abominations, Stoned, Talking Torah with the Baby Bears and What Remains of my Favorite Post. I regret that I read it on Shabbos, because I kept on thinking &#8220;I have a great kneitch to add here&#8221;, or &#8220;that is just like something I once saw on something else&#8221;, or &#8220;that is such a pet peeve of mine as well&#8221;, and I wish I could have annotated the book with my thoughts.</p>
<p>To me, that is the greatest asset of the book. It provides real (fast) food for thought on an unlimited number of Torah subjects. The essays are not ends in themselves, they are starting points for discussion and beginning point to understanding Torah more deeply.</p>
<p>There were a couple of essays which I disagreed with on a theological basis. That is a good thing. That means that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is pushing us to challenge and think. Too often we accept and move on. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> takes that away from its reader and I think that is wonderful.</p>
<p>What moved me the most was DovBear&#8217;s unyielding devotion and dedication to Torah. Questions, answers, problems, solutions, issues and explanations did not deter DovBear as throughout the book he remained dedicated to Torah and mitzvos. It was clear to me, the reader, that DovBear is passionate about his Judaism and takes pride in his adherence to Torah and mitzva observance.</p>
<p>I felt this particularly due to the joy that jumps off the page in DovBear&#8217;s tone as he writes a new insight or thought. The sheer enjoyment is palpable and to me, only a feeling felt through a real dedication to Torah Judaism.</p>
<p>The final essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is &#8220;<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2005/02/great-moments-in-torah-commentary.html" target="_blank">What Remains of My Favorite Post</a>&#8220;. The relevant quote is here:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Any two-bit exegete can flatter his colleagues and offer simpering praise. That sort of behavior may suggest manners, but it doesn&#8217;t demonstrate brains, talent or confidence. Endless praise is the behavior of a </em><a style="color: #3d81ee; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.akademik.cz/ias/GFX/smithers.gif"><em>sycophant</em></a><em>, someone who values popularity over truth and integrity. Is that really what we want&#8230;</em><em>? An endless exchange of Valentines?</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>As a blogger who has been </em><a style="color: #3d81ee; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://benchorin.blogspot.com/2004/12/dovbear-reacts-to-my-previous-post.html"><em>smacked around </em></a><em>(and who has done his share of </em><a style="color: #3d81ee; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://biurchametz.blogspot.com/2004/11/terrorism-only-for-consenting-adults_09.html"><em>smacking</em></a><em>) I can relate. The roughness is how some people prefer to communicate but it&#8217;s always sign of respect to be noticed, and mentioned. Moreover, rough language often comes with the territory when ideas are at stake.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>With this thought, DovBear has given license to his readers to criticize. A review with no criticism would be shallow and empty. It is in this light that I present my sole critique.</p>
<p>Imagine you buy a brand new car. Let&#8217;s say you got your first new Lexus. It is a beauty and something you have coveted for years. You get into your new ride and turn the key, ahhhh, the engine roars to life. You exert some pressure on the gas pedal, ahhhh, the cars purrs as it accelerates. Your hand reaches for the radio and you push the power button and&#8230; nothing. The radio doesn&#8217;t work. Big deal, right? The car is a Lexus, you didn&#8217;t get a Lexus for the radio &#8211; right? But it still bothers you &#8211; right?</p>
<p>That is how I felt a couple of times while reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a>. The content is so good and yet it could use another good proof-reading. There are more than a few typos. There is a lack of consistency in the transliterations. For example one (great) essay is title &#8220;Makot Machlokes&#8221;. Those two spellings are contradictory. Makot is a sephardic pronunciation and Machlokes is an ashkenazic pronunciation. Throughout the book we are treated to both variants with no consistency. Similarly, in a post titled &#8220;Mean Loez&#8221;, the Me&#8217;am Loez is spelled Meam and Me&#8217;am.</p>
<p>This is just like the radio not working in the Lexus. I don&#8217;t tune in to DovBear for perfectly consistent writing style I tune in for substance. But the lack of attention to the nitty gritty in the writing does not do the rest of the book justice. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is too good a book for the reader to be annoyed by typos and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>My only other critique (if this is even a critique) is the lack of content on the summer Parshios and the book of Devarim. I simply wish there was more content in the book.</p>
<p>In summary, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is a masterpiece. It is a masterpiece because so few of us could even write a book like this. Most lay people are not producing innovative thought on Torah and our Rabbis and teachers focus on so many other corners of Torah. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is a mechayev on all of us to think, challenge, study and grow in our Torah study. Each short essay can evoke emotion and thought from its reader.</p>
<p>I recommed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> for every Jewish home. You will probably find yourself agreeing with most of what DovBear has written. And even if you disagree with everything in the book it will still be a worthwhile, if not important read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/anonymous-vs-onymous-blogging.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear</em></strong></a><strong><em>. &#8211; more discussion there.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networks" target="_blank">Social Networking</a> has been around for a long time. The term is nearly two centuries old and the concept perhaps 30 times that.</p>
<p>With the internet explosion around the new millennium social networking became all the rage on the world wide web. MySpace and others blazed the trail. Now, blogging, <a href="http://facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> are an integral part of our social landscape.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was drawn to these new age ways of using technology to create social networks. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve been on Facebook </a>since its inception five years ago and <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">joined Twitter</a> a while ago and have only recently begun to blog.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks some incredible things have happened that are direct results of social networking online.<span id="more-806"></span></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago a lovely woman came to our Shul on the Beach for Shabbos morning services. At the Kiddush (where incredibly, we do not have Kugel) she approached me and introduced herself as &#8220;Rena, I follow you on Twitter&#8221;. Immediately I realized it was <a href="http://twitter.com/tinsbar" target="_blank">@Tinsbar</a> from Baltimore. Rena was in LA for a few days and decided to come check out <a href="http://pjcenter.com/" target="_blank">our Shul.</a> Rena enjoyed her time spent at PJC and we enjoyed her company. In fact one community member even got some footwear recommendations from Rena!</p>
<div>When I related this story to a Shul Board Member, he said this is the new wave of Shuls. We have moved from being just a &#8220;Brick and Morter&#8221; Shul to a &#8220;<em>Click</em> and Mortar&#8221; Shul.</p>
<div>About a month ago <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/05/another-ethical-question.html" target="_blank">I posted the story of a penniless Jewish artist on the beach</a> who was homeless. He needed some money and I was not sure if he was a good candidate for Tzedaka and I posted my moral dilemma on <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">DovBear</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/e-finks-tzedaka-case.html" target="_blank">As reported last week</a>, an anonymous donor (living miles away from Los Angeles) who read the blog post here on DovBear, literally saved this man from a dire situation.</p>
<p>On Twitter I follow a wonderful couple from Connecticut. She is a blogging convert and is now in the process of a more stringent conversion that would be universally accepted. He is a fellow blogger as well who blogs about his relationship with his Judaism.</p>
<p>He recently discovered the wonderful Jewish town of Waterbury CT. With a Yeshiva, Day School, Shul, Mikva, Kosher restaurant and very affordable housing, Waterbury is quickly picking up young couples looking to settle (slightly) out of town. I read all about that on his &#8220;<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/onymous" target="_blank">onymous</a>&#8221; (it&#8217;s a new word that means &#8216;the opposite of anonymous&#8217;) blog.</p>
<p>My sister and brother in law live in Waterbury, I told him to call my brother in law and check out Waterbury. They set a date and spent a wonderful afternoon together.</p>
<p>In short all of this great stuff occurred as a direct result of blogging, Twitter and social-networking 2009 style. These events also occurred in many ways as a result of &#8220;onymous&#8221; blogging. The charity case required someone be known (in this case, me). There is no way Rena would have found me if I blogged and Twittered anonymously. And if I was an anonymous blogger I never would have connected my sister with two fellow Jews looking for friends and connections.</p>
<p>These are the benefits of &#8220;onymous&#8221; blogging.</p>
<p>On the other hand (term of art &#8211; remember that discussion?), anonymous blogging and Twittering is also great. In particular I point to DovBear&#8217;s blog as a bastion of anonymity and great discussion that would admittedly never happen if we all had faces, names and families. The unfortunate realities of the Frum world as they are, almost force us cower in fear when we disagree with authority or tradition and we tend to hide behind familiar rituals, thus avoiding conflict and we are safe behind the veil of secrecy that is anonymous blogging.</p>
<p>Anonymity gives the silent, a voice. It gives us all a chance to be heard.</p>
<p>In truth, we have other things to worry about as well. As <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/dovbear/7834534744960396147/#512532" target="_blank">Tikkun Olam pointed out</a>, we have Frum leaders blanketing all bloggers as a negative force, when we know that is ridiculous. There are some negative forces and many positive forces in the J-Blogosphere.</p>
<p>Worse is the fear we all feel of expressing our opinions. My opinion on this is transparent as I blog &#8220;onymously&#8221;. Speak your mind, challenge what you don&#8217;t understand but never lose the art of respectful questioning. I am (usually) not afraid to speak my mind and challenge what I don&#8217;t understand and thus I don&#8217;t need to be anonymous. Plus, I support many of the traditional ideals that &#8220;they&#8221; espouse. But, the crux of the issue remains the environment which we have created and now support that does not allow for us to challenge.</p>
<p>I say created, and that is self evident. I say support because we &#8220;give in&#8221; to the cyber bullies that force us to remain anonymous. How much greater impact would have as a group if those whom we challenge knew that we were real people? They should know that we have Yeshiva educations, wonderful families and jobs and we are frustrated with the status quo. But to &#8220;them&#8221; we are words on a computer screen, not people.</p>
<p>Words are cheap. Words have no soul when they are anonymous. If we want to be heard we need to be people. People have souls and people need to be dealt with. It is easy to ignore anonymous bloggers. People with souls demand attention and can affect change.</p>
<p>Should we strive to create a Frum culture that allows for challenging and questioning?</p>
<p>Are we helping the situation by blogging anonymously?</p>
<p>Do we lose a lot by blogging anonymously?</p>
<p>Do we stand to lose more by &#8220;onymous&#8221; blogging?</p></div>
