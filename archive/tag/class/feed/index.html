				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://Daf.finkorswim.com"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6092" title="wasserzeichen-projekte.php_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wasserzeichen-projekte.php_-300x100.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="100" /></a>As I mentioned previously, (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/07/31/ode-to-the-siyum-hashas/">Ode to the Siyum HaShas</a>) the Siyum HaShas is a great source of inspiration for me and for many others.  The simplest way to channel that inspiration is to attempt to join the hundreds of thousands of Daf Yomi learners as the program begins from the start of the Talmud on Thursday.</p>
<p>I want to count myself among the many Daf Yomi students and would also like my shul to be a place where Daf Yomi is studied. I also love learning and teaching Talmud. So we have formulated and implemented a Daf Yomi plan at <a href="pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> and we are including all of you.</p>
<p>I have set up a new site at <a href="http://daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">Daf.Finkorswim.com</a>.<span id="more-6091"></span> On that site I will be posting videos and podcasts of every daf. The live classes are being held in advance of the daf schedule so they will be available online on the daf schedule. You can subscribe to the YouTube Channel for the videos or to the podcasts in iTunes, or just visit the site daily. The daf podcasts are separate from the non-daf podcasts. Hopefully we can keep pace and hopefully the online community will make use of the site.</p>
<p>The style of the class will be a fast paced run through the daf. The assumption will be that you do not need any prior Talmud experience to understand the class or appreciate the material. I hope to keep each class between 20-30 minutes. There are many resources on other sites if you want to go more in depth, my idea is to make it as simple and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So, if you are interested in joining the Daf Yomi program I have made it pretty easy to do from the comfort of your home, your car, your lunch break, wherever, and I hope you will avail yourself to the new site. If you have any suggestions please send them my way.</p>

We began Chapter 8 which continues the laws of prophecy. Specifically the Rambam addresses the miracles that Moses performed in the desert in this chapter. We also discussed why we were required to listen to a prophet according to the Rambam.
