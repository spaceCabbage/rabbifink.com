				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I spoke with a Satmar chasid who studies academic Biblical Scholarship. We talked for a while and I got a sense of his typical chasidic upbringing, his current life situation, and his scholarship activity.</p>
<p>Like almost everyone raised in a deeply insular chasidic environment, he speaks English as a second language. HIs accent is not as thick as some of the other chasidic people I know, but it&#8217;s clear that Yiddish is his first language. However, once I got past the accent, it was also very clear that this was an extremely bright and erudite young man.</p>
<p>I talk to people all the time. Some are smarter than others. Some people have quicker minds than others. This fellow was smart, no question about it.<span id="more-7818"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://thetorah.com/satmar-hasid-and-a-bible-critic/" target="_blank">He wrote a superb article</a> describing his journey into Bible Scholarship and the various ways it has adjusted his thinking and Jewish experience. It was beautifully written and made its points eloquently and somewhat poetically. I was asked to vouch for his chasidic bona fides, which I did, based on a mutual friend and my assessment following our conversation. (Verifying that the fellow exists and lives in the Chasidic community is not an endorsement or approval of the content of his article.)<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cityside060501_560-600x396.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7819" alt="cityside060501_560-600x396" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cityside060501_560-600x396.jpg?resize=600%2C396" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The article generated a bit of a firestorm. Not because of its provocative content though. The largest issue seemed to be that people could not believe that a chasid could write such an amazing article. Turns out, the article was too good. It was suggested (accused?) that the chasid had written some notes and the editors of TheTorah.com must have rewritten it in proper English. To alleviate the skepticism I asked to see the original draft he submitted to TheTorah.com and I again confirmed that it was at least 98% of his own writing. Only a few minor edits were made and they were use and stylistic edits, not wholesale rewrites.</p>
<p>But the skepticism remained. People were literally saying that a chasid cannot write so well. It&#8217;s impossible they claimed. I was challenged on my Facebook page and TheTorah.com also received extremely skeptical, bordering on accusatory, comments and feedback.</p>
<p>This is pure bigotry. And it disgusts me.</p>
<p>It is absolutely true that a chasid is going to be severely handicapped by his lack of proper secular education. The average chasid starts much further down on the ladder of English erudition. I don&#8217;t dispute that fact. But with some effort, anyone can learn how to write well. And if one has a gift with words, is able to put ideas into black and white in any language, those skills will translate into beautiful English prose and poetry.</p>
<p>While it is fair to say that a chasid will lack teachable skills simply because a chasid is untaught, it is bigoted to assume that a chasid will lack talent and ability.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/07/15/social-issues-raised-by-the-recent-tragedy/" target="_blank">After the Leiby Kletzky tragedy</a>, I paraphrased <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/11/obligatory-ted-williams-post/" target="_blank">Lee Anne Touhy from &#8220;The Blind Side&#8221;</a>. In talking about the inner city ghetto, Touhy said that the cure for cancer might be in those ghettos. We need to give all youth the opportunity to discover it. The same thing applies to the chasidic ghetto. There are plenty of super talented people behind those walls. Some might have the talent to cure cancer, unfortunately few have the opportunity. Some have the talent to write incredible articles or books in English, unfortunately few have the opportunity.</p>
<p>But when someone gets the opportunity, it&#8217;s cause for celebration and recognition. When a chasid breaks free from the artificial wall his community has placed around him and discovers a special talent, we all benefit. And let&#8217;s not be so prejudiced against chasids that we can&#8217;t believe that talent can be found behind those walls. The only real difference between those on the inside and those on the outside is opportunity. But insofar as talent goes, those on the inside are at least as blessed as those on the outside.</p>
<p>To think that a certain group or subgroup is inherently inferior and incapable of achieving greatness is bigotry. Pure and simple. It&#8217;s no different than saying that a black person cannot be president or that a woman cannot be a Supreme Court Justice or that an Asian cannot play basketball or that an Orthodox Jew cannot be a rockstar. There are talented and incredible people everywhere. Some are given an easier path to discovering and sharing that talent, but talent is everywhere.</p>
<p>We should be encouraging talent from the chasidic community to contribute to greater society, and stop being so shocked when they actually do.</p>
<p>One suggestion would be to stop using &#8220;chasidish&#8221; as a pejorative, whether in style of clothing or otherwise. To stop imitating or mocking chasidic people for their accents and foibles. We all know that non-chasids do it. But it contributes to a bigotry that makes it impossible to believe a chasid might be the next Hemingway. Let&#8217;s help make that happen and not stifle their creativity. Let&#8217;s embrace their talent, not question it. I guarantee you that they will continue to impress us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2603_MEDIUM.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7226" alt="2603_MEDIUM" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2603_MEDIUM.jpg?resize=300%2C272" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Yesterday, in an article in Newsday, the world was introduced to the term Tuna Beigel. Now it&#8217;s time to retire it.</p>
<p>A little Googling will yield plenty of results for the term and almost all of them are negative. It&#8217;s used to describe people born to chasidic families who modernize. They keep many of the exterior elements of chasidishe life but lead lives that are not insular at all. They are familiar with popular culture, they have less rigid ideas about modesty, and they live outside the chasidic enclaves. However, I would say that these people are by and large orthodox. If they leave orthodoxy they leave this group.</p>
<p>For non-chasidim, these people can seem odd. They don&#8217;t speak English well, they are under-educated, they have chasidishe foibles and tendencies. Because of these barriers they don&#8217;t really integrate perfectly into the mainstream yeshiva world or into the modern orthodox world. Hence, they have their own group and their own name. The separate name and their lack of integration are an indictment of the frum world. Non-chasidim must do a better job of welcoming those who left insular community. Titles that mock their difficult choice would not a good way of doing this.</p>
<p>The problem is that Tuna Beigel is a pejorative.<span id="more-7225"></span> It is used to mock their Yinglish and I am told that many people use it derisively and many feel derided by the word. Of course there are many people from this group that use the word proudly. They are not insulted by the word at all. But too many people find the term offensive for it to be used in civilized conversation.</p>
<p>Personally, I compare it to using the &#8220;off the derech&#8221; to describe someone who left orthodox Judaism. I try very hard not to use that description because I think it is offensive. It tells those who left orthodox Judaism that they are off the path which implies that they are defective. While it&#8217;s true that orthodox Jews believe there is a path and those who left are not on the path, calling attention to that is implicitly offensive. Now, some people who fit into that category don&#8217;t find it offensive. That&#8217;s cool. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that we should use it. You&#8217;ll not find a single mention of that phrase on this blog unless I am quoting or paraphrasing someone else. That&#8217;s because I find it offensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, the term for modernized chasidim should not be offensive. In fact, I believe they should be celebrated and embraced. They are heroes. They are choosing our life. And it&#8217;s even more impressive that they are staying within the confines of orthodox Judaism even after having left the insular community. That&#8217;s the interesting thing about the article in Newsday. It&#8217;s a growing phenomenon and we hope it continues to grow.</p>
<p>In my private life I don&#8217;t use the word Tuna Beigel. In my public life I do not want to use it either and I don&#8217;t want others to use it. Try Modern Chasidim if you need a title. That&#8217;s what I use and I think it is a respectful and accurate description. (Modern Orthodox doesn&#8217;t work because that group stands for Torah U&#8217;Mada, excellence in secular education and high professional accomplishment. Hopefully the next generation of Modern Chasidim can grow into that.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stop using this ugly term to describe Modern Chasidim. Let&#8217;s do a better job of helping them integrate into the non-chasidic world. If I offended anyone by my association with the article in Newsday, please forgive me. I admire the Modern Chasidim (and you ex-hasids too) and did not intend to hurt anyone. I hope we can work together to end the use of this term and create a brighter future for those who choose not to stay in the insular chasidic community.</p>
<p>(Also, I think the article is interesting. I was quoted a few times too.)</p>

In general, I think that many women are scared that if they leave the ultra-orthodox community they will be forced to forgo custody of their children. This is a legitimate fear. That was my point yesterday.</p>
<p>Today, I will address this case and I will attempt to be brief.</p>
<p>The case is complex and there is no simple solution. Both of the parents are flawed human beings, just like the rest of us. Both parents have some merit to their case. The judge seemed to skew toward the father whenever it was a judgment call and away from the mother when it was a judgment call. The primary issue in the case, as always, is what is the best interest of the child.</p>
<p>One aspect of that was where the children would have less &#8220;confusion&#8221;. With very little support and with a dismissive wave of the hand to the mother&#8217;s expert, the judge ruled that having the children live a new secular life with their mother would be more harmful than continuing the same life with their father.</p>
<p>I think this was the weakest part of the case.<span id="more-7105"></span></p>
<p>The children will still be seeing their mother on a fairly regular basis. Although she is required to adhere to the rules of the children&#8217;s&#8217; school, they will know she is not chasidic like their father is. So it&#8217;s still confusing. I don&#8217;t see how this solves anything.</p>
<p>In other words, the court established as a fact that there would be confusion is she were awarded custody &#8211; this was speculative and rebuttal evidence was not really considered, then the court established that to minimize confusion the father should be awarded custody &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t seem to solve the problem. This was the extent to which religious values and practices were applied in the case. It was purely with regard to &#8220;confusion&#8221;.</p>
<p>In terms of this case, I think the evidence to support custody on either side was weak. Neither side made a great case. The &#8220;confusion&#8221; section of the decision was particularly speculative (which is ironic considering how the judge dismissed some evidence in favor of the mother because it was too speculative). In the trial transcript the judge clearly said that the mother has the right to choose to leave orthodox Judaism, however she cannot make that choice for her children. I found that troubling. I wonder how old or how young a child must be for a parent to have the right to take their child out of orthodox Judaism? Maybe never?</p>
<p>In terms of the general issues this case raises, I think there are some legitimate concerns. First, like I said above, I think that losing child custody is a fear that many women have when they consider leaving orthodox Judaism. I am not sure this is the best tactic for keeping people in the fold nor do I think it is a positive message from the Frum community. But I think this case opens the door to fighting this presumption. The court relied heavily on the &#8220;confusion&#8221; for the children if their mother was no longer ultra-orthodox. This can be rebutted. It might take some time, it might take some better experts, but by no means is this a <em>fait accompli. </em>Further, the court seemed to have been much more amenable to joint custody solutions if the mother would have committed to even the slightest observance. There is room in the most liberal sects of modern orthodoxy for very relaxed observance. It seems that this would have been enough to allay fears of confusion. This just goes to show how little sense the &#8220;confusion&#8221; issue makes.</p>
<p>In sum, the case was decided on several issues. It was a harsh decision that I don&#8217;t think solves the issues it purports to solve. It was not a purely religious decision. It seems that this case need not be a case that will impact future cases of women in similar situations if the chips fall just a little bit differently.</p>
<p>I empathize with the mother in this case, but I do not feel that the sole issue in the case was religious observance. It may have played to prominent a role, but I have a feeling she may have lost custody even if &#8220;confusion&#8221; was not at issue here. In the end, it is extremely painful to read, let alone experience, a judge deciding the fate of a family. I can only imagine what kind of pain the entire family is experiencing. In particular, the mother, who lost custody must be completely beside herself. I wish her much strength in putting the pieces back together and finding happiness and success in the next phase of her life.</p>

<p>It seems the &#8220;impossible&#8221; has happened again. Kelly Myzner lost custody of her children last week.</p>
<p>I have not seen the court documents. Although I have read a few articles about the case and I am well aware that every situation has at least two sides to the story.</p>
<p>If you want to see one version of the facts go to Unpious and read <a href="http://www.unpious.com/2013/05/ex-hasidic-mother-loses-custody-of-children/">Ex-Hasidic Mother Loses Custody of Children</a> by Shulem Deen. Whether the facts are the way the ex-hasid community presents them or not, the phenomena is real.<span id="more-7101"></span></p>
<p>It is true that <em>baalei teshuva </em>in the chasidic community will be set up with less than stellar matches. It is true that sometimes those less than stellar young men or women have personality defects. It is true that personality defects worsen in one&#8217;s 20&#8217;s and are further exacerbated by marriage and parenthood. It is true that people who are in bad marriages will see the worst of their society and will look outside their community. It is true that people in a marriage can get fed up with one another and find themselves in completely different religious spheres. Sometimes the couple will seek divorce.</p>
<p>What happens next is the real point here.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the primary caregiver &#8211; usually the mother, is awarded primary custody. However, sometimes the mother is denied custody for a potpourri of reasons. One reason that has been used in court proceedings is that the children should stay in the same religious environment. Usually this means that the parent who is deviating will lose custody. When it is the mother, the courts will sometimes deny the mother custody.</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this: First, the assumption could be that deviating from the agreed upon religious beliefs in the marriage is like a breach of contract. She breached, so he wins. Second, deviating could be viewed as a a symptom of imbalance. Third, the children have a status quo of religious practice and taking that away from them and them away from it is unfair collateral damage. Fourth, the court systems are rigged and they are bought and paid for by the ultra-orthodox community. Fifth, the ultra-orthodox community projects a unified front and unwavering support for their own so the chances that the children will be cared for increases within the ultra-orthodox community. Sixth, the ultra-orthodox community pays for a super-lawyer while the deviating party gets by with a legal aid lawyer and the super-lawyer wins.</p>
<p>I am not saying that all these reasons are true, fair, or valid. However, they are all part of the equation. So I don&#8217;t think that the sole reason anyone loses custody is because they deviated from the religious beliefs. But religion is definitely used as a weapon in these proceedings.</p>
<p>My feeling is that the children of these families are going to need their mothers more than most children. They will have a hard time throughout their lives due to the disparate religious beliefs of their parents and families. As long as the mother is a good mother, the mother should be taking care of the children. A good mother has nothing to do with religion. Good mothers are everywhere, not just in the ultra-orthodox community.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a very strong reason to deny the mother custody. I don&#8217;t think that being an atheist is a valid reason. More importantly, I don&#8217;t love the idea of the secular court system weighing the religious beliefs of the parents to determine custody. It&#8217;s probably not a good idea and it might not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.</p>
<p>Most importantly, using children as pawns in any custody battle is deplorable. But when children are used to keep people in the fold we cross the line from deplorable to cult-like. The community does not own the children. That is what happens in a cult. Parents are responsible to raise their children as they deem fit. If the parents have differing opinions on those issues, it is their issue and they must resolve it. But using the brute force of a strong insular community to win the day is just not acceptable.</p>
<p><em>If I see the court documents I will be able to confirm the particulars of this case. In the meantime these are my general thoughts.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6777" alt="Choices" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Choices.jpeg?resize=300%2C239" data-recalc-dims="1" />The Forward deserves a lot of credit for publishing a <a href="http://forward.com/articles/172778/a-mother-is-who-i-am/?p=all" target="_blank">very nice article written by Rachel Freier</a> about the joys of Hasidic motherhood. Unlike Judy Brown, Freier is still part of the Hasidic community and she argues that being a <em>yiddishe momme</em><em> </em>is who she is. It defines her. She argues that the pressure and value placed on having children in the Hasidic community is vital and a beautiful part of her lifestyle. It is what makes her life worth living.</p>
<p>Freier is an attorney. I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I think she might be the only Hasidic woman who is a lawyer <em>(NOT INCLUDING LUBAVITCH).</em> As an orthodox Jew, I am very proud of women like Rachel Freier. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/" target="_blank">With all the talk of whether women can &#8220;have it all&#8221;</a>, she is a example of someone who does have it all. She has a family &#8211; 6 kids. She has a career &#8211; a law practice. She has religion &#8211; Hasidic Judaism. She has it all. As a role model, I think she is an excellent person for orthodox Jewish women to emulate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also inspiring to see someone who has it all, coming back to their role as a parent, and in her case as a mother as the thing she values most and as the part of her life that defines her. I cannot say it with any more conviction &#8211; More Rachel Freiers please!</p>
<p>But, and you just had to know there was a &#8220;but&#8221; coming, I don&#8217;t entirely agree with her approach.<span id="more-6776"></span></p>
<p>I think Freier makes a mistake that a lot of women with traditional values make. They think that feminism or modern gender roles seeks to eliminate the traditional homemaker or <em>yiddishe momme</em> from society. Therefore, they will argue that there is a lot of value and beauty in traditional roles where women are mostly mothers and wives.</p>
<p>But that argument is not a counter argument to feminism. It is not a counter argument to the Deborah Feldmans and Judy Browns of the world. All they are arguing is that women should have a <em>choice</em>. If a young woman wants to marry after a couple dates, great. If a woman want to have children right away, great. If a woman wants to have a large family, great. But what if they don&#8217;t? Should they be pressured? Should they be forced? Should they feel like they must do what they don&#8217;t want to do?</p>
<p>Brown, Feldman, feminists, etc. want women to have choices. Freier is happy with her life. That&#8217;s great. Really. I hope many women can follow in her footsteps. I am happy for her and for the thousands and thousands of women who chose motherhood, or even if they merely accepted motherhood, but did so with exuberance and gusto. But there are too many women (and men too) who would like to have options.</p>
<p>By limiting options, traditionalists are implying that with a choice, too many would opt out. That doesn&#8217;t make for a very compelling case to opt in. So what I suggest strong, successful, more traditional women in the Hasidic and non-Hasidic communities do, is join the voice of the progressives who want women to have that choice and then and only then make their case for traditionalism. Don&#8217;t make the case for traditionalism and hope to head off anyone from rejecting it. Give our daughters every option available to them and guide them, teach them what values you think are important. If they buy in, great. If not, they will be productive, happy, contributing members of society in other ways. They may have but a few children instead of half a dozen or more. Or they may postpone motherhood for a few years. Let them. Please.</p>
<p>Rachel Freier had options. She is a lawyer. Clearly, she has excellent command of the English language. But far too many of the young women in her community are deprived of the tools that would enable them to have a choice and they march in lockstep to a sit in date at 17, the bridal canopy at 18, and the maternity ward at 19, and at 21, and at 23, and so on.</p>
<p>I know that Freier does not appreciate this point because of her law school anecdote. She took a brave stance in her law school classroom discussion on abortion and argued that abortion should not be legal because <em>&#8220;having children is a blessing and each day that I gave birth was the most memorable day of my life. The joy of motherhood cannot be properly described in a law school casebook.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great argument in favor of someone <em>electing</em> not to abort a pregnancy. It is <em>not</em> a valid argument against giving women a choice about aborting a pregnancy. I am not arguing that abortion is good, bad, or otherwise. There are perhaps very good arguments to ban abortion. The joy of motherhood is not a valid argument when the potential mother does not want that joy or maybe she doesn&#8217;t even feel it. This anecdote shows that Freier misses the point on the choice to have an abortion and on the march to motherhood. Women should have choices, so long as they are moral and justifiable in one&#8217;s legal and ethical code. There is nothing in halachic Judaism that should prevent a young woman from having a choice.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget, that there are many women in the Hasidic community who would never let their daughters attend law school. Would Ms. Freier not argue that even Hasidic women should have that option?</p>
<p>We love our <em>yiddishe mommes. </em>They play a very important role in the future of our people. We want our <i>yiddishe mommes</i> to want to be <em>yiddishe mommes</em> and embrace that role. But it&#8217;s only one role. It need not be the only role.</p>

One segment of the series featured a profile on an all girls, chasidic school in Williamsburg NY with incredible standardized test scores.</p>
<p>According to the radio segment, the success of the school is mostly a result of their teacher training. The school hires young women who are 18 or 19 years old and trains them to teach with excellence. The teachers make $6000 a year and have no formal educational training.</p>
<p>The mastermind behind this is a chasidic woman named Miriam Amsel. She personally trains the teachers and helps them succeed with regular development meetings. During the sessions she helps the teachers grow in their skills and techniques. It is key that the teachers buy into her wisdom and they hang onto her every word. She offers this amazing quote during the radio segment:<span id="more-6387"></span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;</em><em>Success is never the result of having all the answers. It is the result of being open for all the questions.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>That is a great lesson. In fact the story on the WNYC website &#8220;Questions Lead Way in One School&#8217;s Teacher Training&#8221;. I am sure she means it as well. But in the ultra-orthodox community this does not seem to be the norm. Some questions are allowed. Other questions are decidedly out of bounds.</p>
<p>I am amazed at the success of this school and I think anyone would be equally impressed with the scores of these girls, especially in English which is their second language.</p>
<p>The article on WNYC&#8217;s site highlights two more factors in the school&#8217;s success:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Unlike at the city’s public schools, college and career readiness are not the focus at Tiferes Bnos because Hasidic society strongly discourages its members from attending college. Nevertheless, Amsel and her teachers say that for their girls, a good education is important so they can be productive and thoughtful members of the community.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many elements of success at the private school would not be easy to replicate in a public school: The students, as members of the insular Hasidic community, are mostly sheltered from the distractions, like television and video games, and problems, like single-parent homes, that many low-income students in public schools face. Girls as a group tend to do better academically than boys. And the songs Tiferes Bnos teachers sing to build cohesiveness and raise morale are not likely to catch on in the city’s public schools.</em></p>
<p>I agree that education is important. But I also think education should not stop when one graduates high school. I also wonder what the science education is like. I also wonder what these young women are doing with their education if they are not continuing on to higher education.</p>
<p>I also agree that distractions are just that, distractions. But I am not convinced that taking away all distractions is good for children in the long run. It may produce better test scores. But does it produce better people? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>There is some skepticism over these scores. As a skeptical person, I am very curious how these tests are administered in this school. I am not accusing them of cheating or fixing the scores. But I would be much more confident if the scores could be independently verified. If only just to ease my conscience.</p>
<p>Another thing that bothers me a little bit about the article is its portrayal of the school as catering to low-income families. While it is true that the families in the school are low-income, they are not subject to the same sort of conditions and circumstances as the children of other low-income families and areas. Family life is revered. There is a community safety net. Further, a lot of the families in the community are low-income by choice and they live a more than half decent lifestyle. Parents chip in and the government subsidies are leveraged to the maximum. Other low-income schools and communities do not enjoy such luxuries so perhaps the metric should not be income, rather it should be family stability, crime rates, and comfort of living.</p>
<p>I also fear that this incredible accomplishment will be viewed as vindication for all charedi schools. Clearly, education is not that great in most ultra-orthodox schools. This school is an exception that proves the rule. Just because they can do it somehow does not mean that all schools are capable of pulling off this kind of success, especially with young teachers with no professional degrees. It speaks to the incredible talents of Mrs. Amsel, but there is a reason she is singled out as an exceptions; she is exceptional.</p>
<p>In all, the school is making a great Kiddush Hashem and I am very happy to learn of the great test scores in this school. <em>Kein yirbu.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RichardJoelHeadshot.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6253" title="RichardJoelHeadshot" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RichardJoelHeadshot.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Contrary to popular belief, I did not attend Yeshiva University. I&#8217;ve only been there four times in my life. Once for a concert, twice for a video job, and once for the Seforim Sale in 2001 (I bought a Tzidkas HaTzadik and a fancy Mesillas Yesharim). But as I have evolved through my adult years, I have come to learn that I share a considerable amount with YU in many respects.</p>
<p>This is not entirely surprising as the Yeshivas that I attended are not that far off from YU in terms of their overall worldview. With the recent shifts to the right across orthodox Judaism, YU is now very near the style of Judaism in which I was raised.</p>
<p>I was offered the opportunity to interview President Joel as a follow up to his State of the University address which was masterfully delivered at YU last night. President Joel is even better on the phone than he is behind the podium and I really enjoyed our conversation. We discussed a variety of topics that are of interest to the readers of this blog and while I didn&#8217;t transcribe every word of our conversation, I did take notes. What follows is a synopsis of the more compelling parts of our conversation.</p>
<p>What jumped out at me during the State of the University Address was President Joel&#8217;s use of the term Modern Orthodox L&#8217;Chatchila.<span id="more-6251"></span> I too have discussed this topic and am a firm believer that the most perfect Jew is one who is passionate about Torah and scholarship in Torah while being engaged in the outside world. In our conversation, President Joel expanded on this by explaining that Torah U&#8217;Mada can be a very sterile approach. The new approach is Shleimus, the complete person. The idea is that Torah is not supposed to be practiced in an Ir Miklat (city of refuge), it is supposed to be a launching pad. While Torah U&#8217;Mada is part of that philosophy, it became associated with certain apologetics. The modified approach is that Torah U&#8217;Mada is an aspiration, not one specific approach for those who can&#8217;t hack more insular versions of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>This relates to the idea of the Big Tent that President Joel spoke of. There has to be a place for as many people as possible to fit under the tent. In his words, Jews are better at division than multiplication. It&#8217;s a cute line, but also rings true. Although, in my opinion <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/">There is No Tent</a>.</p>
<p>We also discussed the basic dichotomy of insularity vs. engagement. President Joel echoed my thoughts when he described the history of Ashkenazi Jewry. We didn&#8217;t have the option of engagement for most of those years. Our ideal was simply to survive. Survival meant physical and spiritual survival. But President Joel said that the Torah wants us to thrive, not merely survive. Thriving means to engage. There are risks to engagement. The tightrope is difficult to walk. But the view from that tightrope is supremely grand. He compared it to the seven branched menorah with the six lights on the sides pointing toward the middle.</p>
<p>President Joel acknowledged that there are people who leave modern Orthodoxy just like there are people who leave more insular groups. It&#8217;s not a solution as much as an alternative. But the main factors according to President Joel are not philosophy or worldview. The main factors are the home, education, and as he puts it &#8211; mazel. In many respects, society is antithetical to Torah and its values. We need passion and intellectual Judaism to survive that threat.</p>
<p>I told President Joel that even where I come from, the leftmost edge of the yeshiva world, YU is usually a topic of derision. I asked President Joel if he had a message for those on the right that look askance at YU. He began his response by making it very clear that they have respect for the entire Jewish community. To the right and to the left. He invited anyone to come to the Beis Medrash and see that it is comparable to any great yeshiva throughout the world. He said you&#8217;ll find 600 guys learning lishma at night seder. The Roshei Yeshiva are all very significant Torah scholars. They also have degrees. 60% have Masters and 20% have a Ph.D. He volunteered that they don&#8217;t treat Gemara like a college course. Torah is Torah and it is primary. He offered anyone who wants to see it in person to come and wear a mask if they want. But they will see that despite some hashkafic differences, YU is mehadrin when it comes to commitment to Torah learning.</p>
<p>My follow up question was whether YU was doing or considering doing &#8220;kiruv&#8221; on the charedim to try and engage charedim and bring more charedim to YU. He responded that the economic realities are making YU a more attractive option. People need to earn a living now more than ever before and YU gives young people a chance to continue their learning and lay the foundation for a parnassah. Additionally, YUTorah.org gets 75,000 hits a month. Whenever he meets charedim people tell him they love YUTorah.org. Through Torah there is more of a connection than ever before. <a href="http://efink.tumblr.com/post/30917612411/maimonides-is-a-bit-like-a-trojan-horse-of-reason" target="_blank">To borrow a term</a>, YUTorah.org is like the YU Trojan Horse into the charedi world. President Joel is in contact with charedi leaders but he gets the sense that there is not much interest on their part. But he noted that there are fewer attacks against YU these days. I think that might have to do with the new charedi whipping boy YCT. But President Joel ended this part of our conversation by reiterating that he really believes Eilu v&#8217;Eilu applies here. He would love for recruitment to go to more charedi high schools and they have started to do that a little bit. The big tent includes the right and the left.</p>
<p>Our last two topics were more specific. I asked President Joel about Orthopraxy and those leaving Chasidic Judaism. First Orthopraxy. President Joel was very familiar with the phenomenon but began by saying that Orthopraxy is better than nothing. Mitoch shelo lishma, bah lishmah. He believes that the Education School is dealing with this on a broad scale. Passionless Judaism is a huge challenge. But he felt that there is plenty of passion at YU. President Joel led the first night of slichos with 1000 people in attendance. When he began with Ashrei Yoshvei Veisecha, the roar of the people joining him in prayer was very inspiring. There is a richness of passion at YU and he believes that this is helpful in avoiding Orthopraxy. But in the end, Judaism is more about deed than creed and the primary concern is with mitzvah not emunah. Certainly Judaism cannot be transmitted without spirituality and God, it must be linked with the Divine to thrive, but our focus is on action, not belief. But there is very little that is specifically targeting Orthopraxy and Atheism at YU and President Joel said the point was well taken and perhaps should be addressed more directly.</p>
<p>Finally we got to the ex-Chasids. I told him about my friends in real life and online that left chasidic Judaism. For a lot them, the Chasidic world was a very fragile bubble and once that bubble burst, the only place to go was out. Out meant, out of orthodox Judaism entirely. Personally, I think that many ex-Chasids would be very happy and very successful modern Orthodox Jews. But there is no track from Chasidic insularity to YU. I asked if YU could somehow market itself as an attractive alternative to insular life in the Chasidic world and perhaps provide a soft landing for ex-Chasids. He agreed that this was a great idea, but said that there is nothing like that happening right now. He did say that when Dr. Pelcovitz speaks to charedim and chasidic Jews he always says that he is a professor at YU. The idea is to present YU to them in a way that they may acknowledge its existence positively. This is a tiny step, but an important one. Professor Joel invited me to email him about this idea and discuss it further. I look forward to that opportunity and hope to make good on my suggestion in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>.</p>
<p>I had a wonderful time talking with President Joel and I hope to continue our conversation in the future. Thank you President Joel for your time and the opportunity to get to know YU on a personal level.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/02STONE-tmagArticle.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6224" title="02STONE-tmagArticle" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/02STONE-tmagArticle.jpg?resize=300%2C151" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In the NY Times, Carlos Fraenkel  writes about his initiative to increase cross-communication between believers and non-believers as well as between different groups of believers. Fraenkel is a philosopher and the various philosophies of different groups intrigues him. The basic premise of his efforts is that most people are religious or secular based on things that are completely out of their control. Where one is born, to whom one is born, when one is born, are the most relevant factors in determining beliefs.</p>
<p>Fraenkel paraphrases the great Muslim philosopher who questioned his beliefs when he realized he would have been a fervent Jew or Christian had he been born to a Jewish or Christian family.</p>
<p>I will never forget when <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/09/rabbi-yosef-tendler-of-blessed-memory/" target="_blank">Rabbi Tendler</a> told me that he had the same question. It&#8217;s a bit of an epiphany when one realizes that this is likely the truth. But this question is not the focus of Fraenkel&#8217;s article or this blog post.<span id="more-6223"></span></p>
<p>Fraenkel proposes that we create a culture of debate. People from all backgrounds would discuss their ideas and hopefully arrive at some level of truth. He disingenuously invokes the debates of the middle ages as support. I say disingenuously, because those debates often had fatal consequences for the loser. Be that as it may, Fraenkel&#8217;s proposal is to teach debate and philosophy as a way of increasing mutual tolerance between believers of different faiths and non-believers.</p>
<p>I think he is sincere and I agree with his theory about tolerance. Although, I must forewarn that I am pretty sure that without incredible sensitivity, these debates will result in less tolerance and less adherence to one&#8217;s faith. It is very difficult to have religious debate without it turning personal or offensive. Further, most people are not well versed enough in their religions to carry an honest debate. If he think he can pull it off, more power to him. But I think increased debate will undoubtably lead to less fervent belief. The group with superior debaters will surely influence the others. Meaning, the personality and skill of the debater can outshine the substance of the arguments.</p>
<p>But Fraenkel&#8217;s overall point is very worthy. His idea is to slow the melting pot and create a multi-cultural society where people have strong religious or ethnic identities but live together in harmony. This is a very noble idea and I share this dream. The problem is that when people live in less homogenous environments their strong beliefs are bound to be weakened. Insularity is harmful for many things, but it is helpful for reinforcing beliefs. So while I dream of the same kind of society as Fraenkel, I am skeptical that this dream can become a reality.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend the NY Times article.</p>
<p>On Jewish Ideas Daily, Fraenkel writes a follow up to his NY Times article where he discusses his work with some chasidic Jews. I think only one or two of them are Satmar and the others are Chabad. As you should know by now, Chabad is different than the other Chasidic groups in many ways (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/29/book-review-unchosen/">Book Review | Unchosen</a>) and I think that the differences play a role in their involvement here. But we are going to pretend that all chasidic groups are the same for the sake of this post.</p>
<p>The article is long and sometimes boring, but worth reading in its entirety. The basic idea is that some chasids have a philosophy study group with Fraenkel and this has contributed to their disenfranchisement with their community. This is a really cool idea and I think it is great to learn philosophy, especially with an expert like Fraenkel. The article is also full of excellent observations on insular chasidic life. Many of the observations are equally valid in non-chasidic orthodox environments as well. (Those were my favorite parts of the article).</p>
<p>The problem that I have with this little study group is that they reinforce the stereotype that orthodox Judaism is not up to the challenge of philosophy. The article implies in more than one place that these fellows are the new enlightened orthodox Jews and they now know that orthodox Judaism is incompatible with modern thinking.</p>
<p>However, this is not true. The reason this group feels that way is because they were disenfranchised before they began studying philosophy. They had already left orthodox Judaism in their hearts and minds before they began to study with Fraenkel. I would hardly expect them to survive an in depth analysis of philosophy once their collective bubbles had been burst.</p>
<p>I wish Fraenkel would find a study group of committed orthodox Jews. That would be more interesting to me and more useful overall. As it is now, he is dealing with people who want to leave but are stuck. Not exactly a case study in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Learning philosophy and engaging in debate in the more formative years of yeshiva learning could be very beneficial. It was considered beneficial to the medieval Jewish commentators. We could learn a think or two from them. But in the end, philosophy in Judaism is periphery. It is not the reasons we do anything and it is mostly conjecture as God has not handed us a book of philosophy. But working things out in one&#8217;s mind and challenging each other to understand the questions and answers of our religion is a good thing. It was good 1000 years ago. It should be good now as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close with an invitation to Professor Fraenkel: Come to LA and study with some committed orthodox Jews who are part of less insular communities. I think the results would be extremely fascinating.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6164" title="_" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jpg-300x197.jpg?fit=300%2C197" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Slate has another article in their unofficial series on orthodox Judaism and specifically on chasidic Judaism. In this article, the Internet is presented as a supreme danger to Hasidism.</p>
<p>On this issue, the secular media and the leadership of the chasidic groups agree. The Internet is a Pandora&#8217;s Box for a chasidic Jew. There is no way around it. The article does an effective job of explaining why the Internet poses such a hazard to chasidic Judaism. I don&#8217;t think an honest chasid would disagree with their assessment.</p>
<p>The question then becomes what to do about it.</p>
<p>There are basically three choices that the chasidic community faces. 1) Redouble efforts to protect the community from the Internet. 2) Carry on as is. 3) Adjust their doctrines so that they are less susceptible to the harms of the Internet.<span id="more-6163"></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Option 1 can possibly work. The Internet is ubiquitous. The only way it could work is to literally kick anyone with Internet access out of the community. I doubt that this can be done.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Option 2 is viable either. The truth is that more and more chasidic people are disenchanted with the chasidic lifestyle. I don&#8217;t believe it is a greater <em>percentage</em> of chasidic Jews that are disenchanted, rather with the ever increasing size of their communities, there are simply more people who are going to leave. It&#8217;s a numbers game. If the defectors reach greater proportions, I do believe the community will find it necessary to address the problem vis a vis the Internet. They will either choose Option 1 or Option 3.</p>
<p>And so we arrive at Option 3. The article mentions that many chasids find the information on the Internet incompatible with the chasidic life. To a large extent this is true. But are those things that they find incompatible vital or integral to chasidic or orthodox Jewish life?</p>
<p>Is mocking evolution and science a necessary component of chasidic life? Is family planning a direct contradiction to chasidic life? Does chasidic life require that the non-chasid be stigmatized and delegitimized?</p>
<p>On these issues, the Internet is bound to &#8220;win&#8221; against tradition. There is just too much compelling information out there to even hope that tradition can stave off the attacks from the Internet. But these are not necessary beliefs to Judaism, rather ultra-orthodox, ultra-insular Judaism has adopted these as new tenets of belief. But these tenets are doomed to be forsaken by the Internet generation. They are just too flimsy to survive under scrutiny.</p>
<p>When one is told that the sky is green and the grass is blue, it doesn&#8217;t take much to realize that is a lie and the person who told the lie is a liar. Liars don&#8217;t make for good educators and leaders. Tradition cannot be passed down with lies.</p>
<p>In this respect the less insular orthodox Jewish communities provide better options for dealing with these questions. There are communities that handle these questions pretty well.</p>
<p>The other issue that the article raises is that the chasidic community has some built in &#8220;protections&#8221; that don&#8217;t squarely address the Internet, but they do make it harder to leave. Those are the early age of marriage and child bearing as well as the dearth of secular education.</p>
<p>This means that even if a chasid finds things that make a chasid want to leave the community, it&#8217;s really hard to leave. If one already has a family, and one already has a life on the inside, it can seem impossible to make a life on the outside. Especially if English is a second or third language and one does not even have a high school education. There are also the the benefits of staying in the chasidic community. If people want to stay, but cannot handle the beliefs of the community, you have a sticky situation.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the non-chasidic community can do a better job of welcoming and embracing chasidic defectors. There are many negative stereotypes associated with chasids in the non-chasidic community. Even if true, they are not the fault of the people born there, and it is incongruous to use those stereotypes against those chasids who are trying to leave.</p>
<p>I believe that with more viable and friendly options in the non-chasidic community, we will see fewer defectors file into the secular ranks and more ex-chasids in the non-chasidic community with beliefs and practices that are better equipped to withstand the onslaught of the Internet. But there is certainly work to be done in the non-chasidic communities as well. We&#8217;ll get there soon.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The answer to my question posed in the headline is &#8211; YES! Judaism can survive the Internet. I am not so sure Chasidism can.</em></p>

The national media has picked up the most important story in the orthodox Jewish community of our day. Nothing compares to this. Not Internet bans or Siyum celebrations or kosher hot dogs. This is THE issue of our time.</p>
<p>CNN does a superficial but somewhat thorough and honest segment on abuse in the chasidic community.</p>
<p>I have embedded the report below. You can watch it, share it, and cry for the victims.</p>
<p>I will just make several bullet points:<span id="more-5737"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The segment is not sensationalist or riddled with half-truths. It is honest and straightforward.</li>
<li>Denial is a powerful drug.</li>
<li>I honestly believe that Hynes is not &#8220;protecting abusers&#8221; for the sake of votes. I think he can&#8217;t prosecute without witnesses and he needs cooperation from victims to prosecute. (I wrote about that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</li>
<li>One in five being abused is a number that is not scientific but is very possible. One in five thousand would be enough to push us to deal with the issue. One in five is a number that demands immediate and powerful action.</li>
<li>The intimidation of victims and their families should warrant its own segment. Protecting abusers and sacrificing victims is not just heartless and stupid, it compounds the effects of abuse by giving victims the right to think that they are sacrifices and I believe can be linked to victim suicide.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s obviously not just in the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish communities that abuse occurs, but the approach to dealing with abuse is the main difference between the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish community and the rest of the world. We are not equipped to deal with it internally even if we admit that we have a problem. How could we be?</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/xojane_logo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5611" title="xojane_logo" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/xojane_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C102" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>(If you haven&#8217;t read Chaya&#8217;s article, you&#8217;ll need to read that first. Click: <a href="http://www.xojane.com/relationships/hasidic-women-sex" target="_blank">XOJane</a>)</em></p>
<p>I am very happy that you have found personal satisfaction in your religious life. I am also happy you took to the Internet to profess your love for your personal relationship with God (and apparently your husband). I honestly wish every orthodox Jewish woman was as religiously fulfilled as you are. However, sadly this is not the case.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real issues I take with your effusive article.</p>
<p>You represented your subjective experience as the objective experience of chasidic women. Making things worse, you failed to disclose in the article many important factors that contributed to your personal experience. Indeed, you made them clear in the comments, but it was too little, too late.</p>
<p><span id="more-5610"></span></p>
<p>You were not born into orthodox Judaism. That means that you actually chose the life you live. That&#8217;s amazing and I am so happy for you that you arrived at what I believe to be the truth on your own. But the simple fact is that people who are born into orthodox Judaism don&#8217;t choose it. This means that they are stuck. For better or for worse. Some people are thrilled to be stuck. Others, not so much. But this means that while you feel like you are free to as you please. I am sure you realize that if an orthodox woman would put on &#8220;pants and go snort coke&#8221; she would probably be asked to leave the community and be handed a quick divorce and lose custody of her children. So it is not as free as you intimate. It might feel free to you because you chose it. But it is not free.</p>
<p>The second thing that you did not disclose, and this is a far more egregious error, is that you are a member of the Chabad sect of chasidus. The reason this is so crucial is because Chabad is different than every single other chasidic sect. There are absolutely no social correlations between Chabad and the other sects of chasidus. None.</p>
<p>In the words of Hella Winston (quoted from <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/29/book-review-unchosen/" target="_blank">Unchosen</a>):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With its “mitzvah tanks”, campus Chabad houses, celebrity stuffed fundraising telethons, and outposts across the globe, Lubavitch has become almost synonymous with Hasidism. This despite the fact that in the United State it numbers less than half the size of Satmar and is hardly representative of the Hasidic community as a whole. With their mission – unique in the Hasidic world – to attract unaffiliated Jews, Lubavitchers are raised to engage (Jewish) outsiders, doing missionary work wherever Jews are found around the world. [&#8230;]</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This emphasis on proselytizing has meant that a significant percentage of Lubavitchers were not born in the community but joined by choice. Often those who join [&#8230;] have led formerly secular lives, which likely included a college education or beyond. [&#8230;] Additionally, Lubavitch raises a substantial amount of money from non-Hasidic Jews [&#8230;]. All of this is strong contrast to the other Hasidic sects, which include Satmar, Ger, Viznitz, Belz, Bobov, Skver, Sponka, Pupa and Breslow, to name only a few. In these sects, almost all members are born into the community, and none engages in formal outreach, making them comparatively more insulated from , and less aware of, the ways of the outside society than their counterparts in Lubavitch.</em></p>
<p>You see, the insular chasidic sects bear no resemblance to this world you love. Their world is even more closed and more insular. So your personal experience, while wonderful, has no relevance to the world of chasidic women in the insular sects of Satmar, Ger, Vizhnitz, Square, etc. More importantly, their world is a world where women are more oppressed than in the rest of orthodox Judaism. There are rules against driving, getting an education, men and women walk on separate sides of the street in some communities, there are very strict rules about sex, many women shave their heads, girls are wed after extremely short meetings to young men they barely know, they must wear synthetic (bad looking) wigs, can&#8217;t wear latest fashions (even the modest ones), I could go on and on. The point is that in these communities, women don&#8217;t feel the great freedom and empowerment that you feel.</p>
<p>Ironically, by ignoring all this omitted information, you are causing a disservice to chasidic women everywhere. You make it sound like things are all honky-dory. But they are not. I am sure many chasidic women love their lot in life. But your experience has no bearing on theirs. In fact, I would bet you wouldn&#8217;t last a week in Kiryas Joel or New Square! The things you love about your Judaism are simply not present in those uber-insular communities.</p>
<p>But the most difficult thing about your article is that it completely ignores that plain fact that in halacha, women can easily be perceived as second class citizens. This is an incontrovertible fact. Women cannot be rabbis, cantors, judges, witnesses in Beis Din, and they aren&#8217;t counted as part of a minyan. Women&#8217;s dress codes are medieval, their stained underwear is checked by rabbis, they are discouraged from using contraception, they don&#8217;t study the most important text of orthodox Judaism &#8211; the Talmud (because they are assumed to have weaker minds), and they don&#8217;t take positions of authority. Heck the women in Crown Heights are not even allowed to vote on communal issues! I am well aware of the various apologetics and interpretations of these rules. It could be argued that women have an elevated role and do not require the encumbrances of mitzvah observance. I have used them and taught them myself. Some people buy those explanations, but many others do not. It&#8217;s great that so many orthodox Jewish women are happy with their place in orthodox Judaism, but it is completely reasonable for women inside the system and outside the system to perceive orthodox Judaism as oppressive to women.</p>
<p>In sum, I respect your healthy exuberance for your Chabad lifestyle. I think it&#8217;s great. Share the love. By all means. But please do not generalize and use terms like &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; to describe your personal experience. Not only is it disingenuous, it actually harms the cause of those who are trying to advocate for women&#8217;s rights and opportunities in the chasidic and otherwise orthodox Jewish women. The future of orthodox Judaism will need to make adjustments to the way we deal with women issues (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/13/the-future-of-women-in-orthodox-judaism/">The Future of Women in Orthodox Judaism</a>). Pretending it is perfect as it is, sets us backwards several decades.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/divorce.gif"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5243" title="divorce" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/divorce.gif?resize=269%2C269" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A lot of people seem to agree that the chasidic system (maybe even the charedi system as well) of marriage and dating needs some updating. There is also a consensus that using religion as a weapon to keep people in the fold is wrong. Most people also think that mothers should have custody of their children even if they are not religious and the father is religious.</p>
<p>Is there any hope that the charedi and chasidic worlds can adapt and adjust to fix these problems?</p>
<p>From what I am hearing, the answer is yes. Several commenters on the blog and Facebook have shared encouraging developments. It seems they are open to new ideas. In this spirit, allow me to make a few suggestions. Keep in mind, these are suggestions for insular communities. I prefer non-insular communities in general. But in the meantime, here is some advice that can be implemented within the insular communities.<span id="more-5242"></span></p>
<p>First, some definitions:</p>
<p>Chasidic community: A<em>n insular community where the entire community is expected to conform to one way of religious life.</em></p>
<p>Chasidic dating: <em>Parents arrange meeting between two 17-18 year olds. They meet for 30 minutes. They decline or agree to see each other again. The second date seals the deal.</em></p>
<p>Charedi community: A<em> non-chasidic community that tries to reduce engagement with the outside world and prefers a lifestyle of exclusive Torah study over a career.</em></p>
<p>Charedi dating: <em>Parents arrange a meeting between a preferably 18-19 year old girl and a 22-23 year old boy. They meet for 3-4 hours between 4-8 times. They get engaged and see each other a few times before the wedding 2 months later.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dating</strong></p>
<p>No one under the age of 19 should be considered for a shidduch. They are off limits. Couples should date for no fewer than 1 month and see each other a minimum of 10 times before getting engaged. Dates should be fun, encourage conversation, the conversations should include things like how excited one is about religion and if there are things that they question.</p>
<p>Engagements should last 3 months. The couple should see each other no less than once every two weeks. When they see one another they should have fun and enjoy each other&#8217;s company. They should have at least a preliminary conversation about intimacy before the wedding night. The teachers who will explain to them how &#8220;things work&#8221; should be extremely highly qualified and be as liberal as the community allows.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>Couples should be advised on matters of family planning. This is not the place to go to far into detail. But if the children of the couple will be a burden on the community, they might need to ask a shyla before having children, not vice versa. Further, when a couple has children too quickly, it can stunt the development of their relationship which is barely in its infancy after a contracted dating period and quick marriage.</p>
<p><strong>When Things Go Wrong</strong></p>
<p>During a marriage, one spouse may prefer a more or less religious lifestyle. This should not be immediate grounds for divorce. The goal should be happiness for the couple and keeping the family together. Men should not be defined by the way their wives act and women should not be defined by the way their husbands act. Religious compatibility does not need to be the deciding factor in marriage. I know couples who are very happy and they each observe to different degrees. This should be acceptable.</p>
<p>If the couple is incompatible religiously and incompatible in general a divorce should be sought. The get should not be withheld at all. The couple should strive for a custody agreement that is mutually agreeable. If they cannot agree, the secular courts should decide it. A Beis Din is not the place to decide custody matters when one parent is more religious than the other. It is inherently unfair. The couple better try their best to agree because the courts may decide to create a system that neither party likes.</p>
<p>These are some of my thoughts and ideas. I don&#8217;t imagine that they will solve all the problems. Nor do I imagine that any system is perfect. But I do believe that not tweaking the system will cause it to collapse. Albert Einstein said: <em>&#8220;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We want different results. We want better results. Perhaps these suggestions can help just a bit.</p>
<p>I am open to any ideas you have. Remember we are trying to maintain the basic standards of the chasidic and charedi communities. Major overhauls are a non-starter.</p>

It is unorthodox. It is a rejection. But I did not find it scandalous. Not at all.</p>
<p>There is so much about this book that needs to be discussed. Let&#8217;s get a bit of insignificant criticism out of the way. For starters, I found the writing decent. Not excellent. It got better as the book progressed, but the early chapters were tedious in my opinion. The writing is over-descriptive to a fault. Too many sentences have too many adjectives and adverbs. The book doesn&#8217;t allow the reader any imagination. There&#8217;s no room for the reader to breath. It&#8217;s sensory overload. It&#8217;s almost like the author is trying too hard to prove herself as a good writer. Personally, I found it quite annoying.</p>
<p>The story is unremarkable. Shorter version of the book: Girl raised by her grandparents because her mother is a lesbian who left the community and her father is mentally ill has high anxiety and feels constrained by the limiting lifestyle of her community eventually leaves the community. It&#8217;s not a story we haven&#8217;t heard before nor is it a story we will not hear again.</p>
<p>The truth is that anyone with high anxiety will not have an easy time in any tight-knit, insular community. It&#8217;s not really that chasidic Judaism didn&#8217;t work for Deborah. It&#8217;s that her difficult childhood and personality didn&#8217;t work well in the high pressure society of chasidic Judaism. She probably would have been fine in a more moderate form of orthodox Judaism. Unfortunately for her, she was born into extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Honestly, there was nothing &#8220;scandalous&#8221; in the book. (I will address the one scandal that has been manufactured at the end of this post).<span id="more-5177"></span> In other words, the book, fairly accurately describes the life of a chasidic girl in Williamsburg. It is insular. Education is placed at a minimum. Marriage is the goal of childhood, motherhood is the goal of adulthood. This is no scandalous. This is fact.</p>
<p>There are in fact, renegade renegade mikva attendants. There are libido charged teenage boys who are inappropriate toward girls (and other boys). There are stories of talking fish. People did burn their wigs. Secular books are frowned upon. Superstitions are rampant. People gossip. Especially about young married couples. There is abuse and it is covered up. There is prejudice against members of other chasidic sects and certainly against non-chasidic Jews, especially modern orthodox Jews and Sephardic Jews. Strange tales like eating pig will make you vomit are told. These are just the expected social conventions of the insular chasidic community. Nothing to see here.</p>
<p>But are these items an indictment of the entire chasidic community? Certainly not. Bad people and dumb ideas exist everywhere. The biggest gripe I have is simply the imaginary principle that there are no bad people or dumb ideas in the community. There are and knowing there are goes a long way to fixing those people and ideas.</p>
<p>The book brought me to tears twice. For a sap like me, that is not a good showing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> made me cry a ton of times. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen: The Hidden Lives of Hasidic Rebels</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0807036277&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> moved me to tears a bunch of times. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> was not an emotional book. The only moments for me were the birth of her child and the when she and her son come to grips with the fact that the unhappy, broken, marriage is over. That&#8217;s it. The rest felt a bit detached and unremarkable.</p>
<p>But I like to find social commentary and universal lessons in this kind of book and I think there are some important issues the book raises.</p>
<p>Deborah&#8217;s personality is to question and to learn. In her community this is a dangerous trait. Her first step off the path was learning Talmud. That&#8217;s an innocent curiosity in most orthodox communities, even for a girl. But Deborah had to hide it. She couldn&#8217;t ask questions about what she had learned. With this her rebellion began.</p>
<p>Although Deborah relates to her grandmother as a rebel. I don&#8217;t think she realized how special her grandfather was. At least, what is recorded in the book paints Zaidy as a good guy. He avoids the Satmar politics. He is willing to read a newspaper after 9/11. He doesn&#8217;t believe in superstition and stories like the talking fish in New Square. He is also a bit of a rebel. In my eyes, Zaidy is a reasonable guy throughout most of the book. What&#8217;s unfortunate is one negative portrayal made its way onto the book jacket. But other than that incident, he seems to be a good guy. I think that his independence of allegiance and thought are worthy of praise and if more of his neighbors were like him, I think many issues in the insular community would be mitigated.</p>
<p>Her shortlived marriage leaves many unanswered questions. I would have liked more details. She says they fight. About what? The book doesn&#8217;t elaborate. She talks about their neighbors in Airmont. I am from Monsey, I know those people. I would have liked more about that period of her life. The life of what has become known as a &#8220;Tuna Beigel&#8221;. They dress somewhat chasidic but are much more liberated. Why didn&#8217;t that lifestyle work for Deborah? These are areas of the book that feel rushed and unfinished.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the book was the twist of fate that began with a visit to a Kabbalist. He told Deborah that her number was &#8220;nine&#8221;. On 9/9/9 just after midnight, Deborah had a life-changing motor vehicle accident. She says that the Kabbalist was right. Her number was nine. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think that is what the Kabbalist had in mind. But it&#8217;s poetic justice that his words were used by Deborah to rationalize her departure from the community.</p>
<p>The overall &#8220;lesson&#8221; of the book, if there is one, is that her whole life, as a good Chasidic girl, Deborah was taught to trust her intellect over her impulse. She was supposed to use her knowledge of Jewish law and thought to guide her and not allow her emotions and passions. Her freedom came when she put her impulse ahead of her intellect. Judaism is really all about placing one&#8217;s intellect above their impulse. Everyone from Maimonides to Luzzato talks about this. The trick is to channel one&#8217;s impulse into positive, creative, useful activity. One is not required to suppress everything about one&#8217;s self. Rather, one is supposed to use the intellect to guide one&#8217;s passions and creativity. The goal is to use one&#8217;s personality to improve the world.</p>
<p>More balanced, moderate forms of orthodox Judaism provide a better framework for avoiding this damaging problem. Most careers and opportunities are available to orthodox Jews. There are a few exceptions. Perhaps it would be useful for the more moderate versions of orthodox Judaism to focus on this aspect of Judaism. Even better, if the more insular versions of orthodox Judaism like the chasidic sects mentioned in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> or the new insular communities in the non-chasidic world would allow these doors to be opened for their communities.</p>
<p>There is somewhat of a happy ending to the book, even for religious, orthodox Jews. Feldman says that she is still proud to be a Jew. In a different sense than before, but still, she is not a &#8220;self hating Jew&#8221; as some have claimed. This is a positive development in light of her difficulties with her community,</p>
<p>To close, allow me to address what has become the biggest controversy over this book: The murder cover-up.</p>
<p>Feldman tells the story of her brother-in-law calling their home and telling them that a heinous murder had just occurred in Kiryas Joel. He was personally there as a Hatzalah member and he claimed that there was a cover-up of the murder.</p>
<p>In the book, the story is told as a rumor. The book makes no claim as to whether or not there was a murder. The only claim being made is that this is what she was told. The point of the story is to illustrate that no one would have a hard time believing that a murder was covered up. As a reader, I am deeply troubled that a rumor like this is even possible. But I did not ever think that Feldman was reporting on something with facts to back it up. This was a record of a conversation that she recalled. The issues that remain are not whether or not there was a murder. It is a much more basic issue. Whether or not a murder could or would be covered up. I don&#8217;t think anyone would find this impossible, what with all the cover-ups of sex abuse, domestic abuse, fraud and corruption. That is the real issue. Whether or not she should have investigated and looked at police reports is irrelevant in my opinion. I don&#8217;t think Feldman thought that including this anecdote in the book would be as scandalous as it has become. I would have preferred if the she had made it clearer that the episode was rumor. But that is how I took it.</p>
<p>In my opinion, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> is a good book. Some are calling it a chillul Hashem. I find this ironic. Here is a woman who left the community. She tells her story. The story seems entirely plausible. But because she left it is chillul Hashem. Yet, when people who stay in the community commit crimes, acts of violence, are unseemly for other reasons, that is not a chillul Hashem. Quite the double standard if you ask me. All communities have what I call &#8220;abhorrent beliefs&#8221;. Is it a chillul Hashem when our abhorrent beliefs or practices are exposed truthfully? That&#8217;s a hard question to answer.  More important is the challenge of dealing with them in a modern world. This will be addressed in a future post. Maybe even tomorrow.<em> (Update: Posted &#8211; <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/21/what-to-do-about-abhorrent-beliefs-in-religions/">What to Do About Abhorrent Beliefs in Religions?</a>).</em></p>
<p>Should you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a>? It&#8217;s interesting enough. Deborah&#8217;s story is unique enough to hold your interest. The inside information about the insular communities of Williamsburg and beyond is worth your time. If you are looking for high drama and massive scandals look elsewhere. It&#8217;s &#8220;good reading&#8221;. Not &#8220;can&#8217;t miss reading&#8221;.</p>

Part 1: </em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/"><em>Thoughts on Kiryas Joel: The Poorest City in America</em></a><em> and Part 2: </em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/01/attempted-murder-in-new-square-an-analysis/"><em>Attempted Murder in New Square: An Analysis</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>There is a certain common sentiment amongst many minorities and ethnicities. It is commonly expressed as &#8220;bringing shame to the family&#8221;. Or sometimes it emerges as a threat &#8220;what will the neighbors think&#8221;. Once in a while you will hear something about the &#8220;family name&#8221;.</p>
<p>These are normal, and by normal I mean occuring fairly regularly, among minorities. These stereotypes are played on incessantly in Hollywood movies and television programs and they make for good entertainment sometimes (eg Bend it Like Beckham).</p>
<p>In Judaism there is a concept of a Shem Tov, a good name. The verse in Ecclesiastes says: &#8220;Tov shem m&#8217;shemen tov&#8221;, a good name is better than good oil. Earning a good reputation and keeping it has a place in the Jewish thought.<span id="more-4304"></span></p>
<p>Based on my readings, anecdotal evidence and observations I think it is safe to say that orthodox Jews are very concerned with reputation. It is the currency of our social environment. I remember when I was in high school I would hear about girls who would talk to boys, but not in public because they &#8220;didn&#8217;t want to ruin their name&#8221;. Schools are careful who they accept into their school because with each new student comes their reputation. Families hide dark secrets so as not to ruin the family name. Matchmaking runs almost entirely on the &#8220;good name stock market&#8221;.</p>
<p>In particular, based on the aforementioned sources, I think it safe to say that enclosed chasidic enclaves take reputations to the next level. There is a communal concern about not only personal reputations and family reputations but there is a general community reputation that exists and is cared for.</p>
<p>The way a good reputation is supposed to work is as follows: A person carries their self well, speaks nicely, follows the law, cares for others and slowly but surely, people notice. A reputation is formed.  However, one small act can destroy even the most pristine reputation. And it can be nearly impossible to recover that good name. I am fond of quoting Ray Donovan. Donovan was a high ranking federal government official during the Reagan administration. He was indicted on charges of fraud among other crimes. Eventually he was acquitted. After his acquittal he famously remarked: &#8220;Which office do I go to get my reputation back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed a shem tov can take years to create and be destroyed in an instant.</p>
<p>A good name arises organically. It is a natural result of good deeds and good will. A reputation cannot be fabricated. It cannot be crafted. It cannot be orchestrated. If it is, the reputation is a fraud.</p>
<p>On DovBear&#8217;s blog I posted a note from a fellow living in New Square (see: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/06/insider-reaction-to-new-square-violence.html">The Insider Reaction to New Square Violence</a>). The writer is reacting to the arson / attempted murder of a fellow community by a fellow community member. He focuses very little on the actual incident. Near the end he prays to God. What does he pray?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Why did God allow Skver to take such a public hit and for the entire community to be embarrassed? I am not in heaven, so this makes no sense to me, why we have received such a punishment?</em></p>
<p>Even in New Square&#8217;s darkest moment, the obsession with embarrassment, reputation and good name is apparent.</p>
<p>But the line speaks to a complete misunderstanding of reputation. A reputation is not crafted. It is earned. And it can be lost rather easily. You can&#8217;t keep a good name when your community has committed horrible acts. Sorry.</p>
<p>Yet, there is a concerted effort by communities like New Square to maintain the pristine image they have crafted while sacrificing or simply ousting those who tarnish it. They don&#8217;t address the problems because the problems are not the issue. The issue is the reputation.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> the parents of children with severe issues, whether it was abuse or simply the child&#8217;s concerns about whether they should be religious, were met with a primary concern over reputation and a secondary (if any at all) concern about addressing the issue.</p>
<p>It has been no different in New Square. The Rebbe&#8217;s comments thus far have been his message to try and repair or resurrect his community&#8217;s good name. But of course, the reputation and good name is not the issue at all. The issue is the broken system in his community. The issue is an attempt on a man and his family&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>The lesson is clear. A good name is earned. It is not manufactured in a spin factory. If you behave contrary to your reputation you lose it. More importantly, if your reputation is harmed because of bad deeds, the first step to fixing your reputation is by fixing the bad deeds. The reputation will return the same way it was earned (hopefully). It doesn&#8217;t magically return when you reiterate positive acts that may have contributed to earning the good name.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, in a backwards town, they got it all backwards.</p>

<p><span>Over <span>Pesach</span>, the NY Times featured a front page article about <span>Kiryas</span> Joel, the <span>Satmar</span> enclave in Upstate New York. See: </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/nyregion/kiryas-joel-a-village-with-the-numbers-not-the-image-of-the-poorest-place.html?scp=1&amp;sq=kiryas%20joel&amp;st=cse" target="_blank"><span><span>Kiryas</span> Joel, N.Y., Lands Distinction as Nation&#8217;s Poorest Place</span></a>.</p>
<p><span>It received minimal attention on the blogs because of its timing. Had it been during a peak blogging season I am sure it would have been the talk of the town. As it was, the article raised some very important issues about <span>Kiryas</span> Joel, welfare in <span>Chassidus</span>, welfare in general and <span>Chassidus</span> in general.</span></p>
<p><span>First, the facts. The poorest place in America with a population of more than 10,000 is <span>Kiryas</span> Joel. KJ is a community that is exclusively <span>chassidic</span> and overwhelmingly <span>Satmar</span>. The second poorest place is a distance speck in the rear view mirror statistically. KJ claims a nearly 70% poverty rate and the second poorest place, Athens Ohio has a 56% poverty rate. The distance between the two is astronomical.</span><span id="more-4200"></span></p>
<p>However, KJ is more like suburbia than a typical poverty stricken neighborhood. Nice late model cars are parked in front of upscale stores, women push nice new strollers and there is virtually no street crime. The more affluent members of the community help their poorer neighbors out with free loans and charity. No one goes hungry. The funds are funneled through the religious leadership of the community as are almost all communal matters.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the generosity is admirable. The sense of trust and connection between members of the community is special and should be commended.</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, some of the ex-<span>chasids</span> in <span>Unchosen</span> see it differently. It is their belief that the leadership of KJ and similar enclaves purposely keep their communities poor. The leadership uses it as a way of asserting their control over the community. People who are uneducated, making little money and with little transferable skills make for good zombie soldiers.</span></p>
<p>The leadership of the community maintains control over the services for the community so if you want a bite of the apple you need to walk the walk. Not only are financial benefits tied to good standing in the eyes of the leadership of the community, but their opinion of you will determine many other social benefits that are bestowed upon members of the community in good standing. Good recommendations for potential spouses requires their approval as well.</p>
<p>One is not permitted to question the system, the leaders or the ideals. The leaders set the rules and there is no room for question or dissent. One opinion, one set of rules, one way of life period.</p>
<p>I believe this kind of leadership is fascist. This is not democracy. It is a dictatorship. It is a communist regime. It is a stark reminder that absolute power, absolutely corrupts.</p>
<p>Oppressing people so that they will be obedient is downright evil. Requiring them to live by an arbitrary set of rules and regulations and cutting them off if they don&#8217;t is a travesty.</p>
<p>If these allegations are true, the leadership of these communities is responsible and reprehensible. That is the worst case scenario. The best case scenario is that the leadership does not realize that this is the result of their choices. But that makes the situation no less dire.</p>
<p><span>For most people living in these communities there is no way out. They rely on their neighbors and friends for everything and they are severely limited in their ability to earn a living outside the community. They speak <span>english</span> as a second language and have below high school level educations.</span></p>
<p><span>The sad irony is that chassidus was created to give everyone an opportunity to connect with the spiritual and religious. It was the everyman Judaism. Today , in some places, [and let me be clear, this is about specific isolated enclaves,] it has been relegated to a cult of blind adherence to leaders who inherited their positions from their fathers or pay the price. This is not what chassidus was supposed to be.</span></p>
<p><span>That is something even a non-<span>chasid</span> like me can get upset by.</span></p>
<p><em>(Tomorrow this will be discussed in the context of the recent arson incident in New Square)</em></p>

<p>While browsing the local Barnes and Noble, I made a stop at the perilously thin Judaism section. There are a couple shelves of mostly uninteresting books. Only one book caught my eye. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen: The Hidden Lives of Hasidic Rebels</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0807036277&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. I vaguely recall hearing about this book a while back. (As in years ago, But I never read it.)</p>
<p>Now I have a renewed interest in the lives of those who live in a community that they are not comfortable in since my <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/13/thoughts-on-ami-magazines-orthoprax-article-the-impostors-among-us/">Thoughts on Ami Magazine’s Orthoprax Article: The Impostors Among Us</a> blog post. So I purchased the book at Barnes and Noble, something I rarely do, and read the book after the meal on the 7th night of Pesach.</p>
<p>The book is really a dissertation by the author who intended to study hasidic Jews in Williamsburg for her Ph.D. By accident, she began a study of those who left or were in the process of leaving hasidic Judaism. For this I am thankful, because it was way more interesting than the former.<span id="more-4194"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> had me almost right away when it distinguished between Lubavitch / Chabad and all other chasidic groups. This is something that I have discussed with friends online and in real life that was very well stated in the book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With its &#8220;mitzvah tanks&#8221;, campus Chabad houses, celebrity stuffed fundraising telethons, and outposts across the globe, Lubavitch has become almost synonymous with Hasidism. This despite the fact that in the United State it numbers less than half the size of Satmar and is hardly representative of the Hasidic community as a whole. With their mission &#8211; unique in the Hasidic world &#8211; to attract unaffiliated Jews, Lubavitchers are raised to engage (Jewish) outsiders, doing missionary work wherever Jews are found around the world. [&#8230;]</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This emphasis on proselytizing has meant that a significant percentage of Lubavitchers were not born in the community but joined by choice. Often those who join [&#8230;] have led formerly secular lives, which likely included a college education or beyond. [&#8230;] Additionally, Lubavitch raises a substantial amount of money from non-Hasidic Jews [&#8230;]. All of this is strong contrast to the other Hasidic sects, which include Satmar, Ger, Viznitz, Belz, Bobov, Skver, Sponka, Pupa and Breslow, to name only a few. In these sects, almost all members are born into the community, and none engages in formal outreach, making them comparatively more insulated from , and less aware of, the ways of the outside society than their counterparts in Lubavitch.</em></p>
<p>This is a very important distinction and I quote the book here because it is an important point about Lubavitch and a more important point about Chasidic Judaism in general. They are isolated. Almost completely.</p>
<p>What happens when someone who was isolated wants to rejoin society at large? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> tells that story. Short version: It is very hard, sometimes humorous and always painful.</p>
<p>The book is similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> (reviewed here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/23/book-review-hush/">Book Review | Hush</a>) in that it does a decent job describing the immense social pressure placed upon members of the Chasidic community. So much of their approach to dealing with issues is by worrying what the neighbors will say and less about what might have caused the issues or even thinking about solutions to the issues.</p>
<p>Another very eye opening element of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> is the interests of those who &#8220;leave&#8221;. The writer of the Ami article assumed it was because of mental illness. Others say it is because they want to commit sins. But the truth is obviously more comples. The subjects in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> had a varitey of interests. Some of the interests were purely intellectual. But they could not satisfy their intellectual interests within their community. They wanted to read literetature or even just Jewish philosiphy from non-Orthodox rabbis. These were forbidden. For this reason many of them began to venture off into the libraries of New York. It seems that the Jewish Theoligical Seminary library, with its vast collection of Jewish books, is a frequent haunt of these rebels. Hardly the places of debauchery and hedonism some are wont to believe draws people away from tradition.</p>
<p>I also found that the confusion between what is mitzvah, halacha, minhag and social convention really hurt these rebels. They were taught that a streimel or chasidic dress in general was on the same level as keeping Shabbos or kosher. Obviously this is not true and wrong. But because they were taught this, it made it that much easier to leave mitzvah observance after shaving a beard.</p>
<p>Something else in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> that was interesting was the revered rabbi who became an orthodox Jewish feminist and left the chasidic community because of their approach to women. He kind of reminded me of a less atheistic version of the orthoprax rabbi (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/01/the-orthoprax-rabbi-takes-the-j-blogosphere-by-storm/">The Orthoprax Rabbi Takes the J-Blogosphere By Storm</a>) and I was pleased to see that he was able to (kind of) leave the Chasidic world but find a comfortable place in the non-chasidic orthodox community.</p>
<p>Of course the Internet played a large role in these people finding each other, finding comfort and finding their new lives. The Internet cannot be blamed, but it was a part of the process.</p>
<p>The thing that left the greatest impact on me was the insight of one woman who left the chasidic world and to placate her family and her daughter&#8217;s father sends her daughter to a modern orthodox Jewish school. She herself is not observant but leaves room for the possibility that she could become more observant after she heals (she was sexually abused) and can reconnect with her Judaism. She expects her daughter to be observant and raises her in that kind of home. She remarked that she would always try to discipline her child to be a good person and keep the rules of Judaism. She tries to make it fun and not about fear. That is a great. But what struck me is that she said that while she might, from time to time, yell at her daughter about other things, she would never yell at her daughter about anything having to do with religion. For her it has to be about love and happiness. Not fear and yelling. At the very least, it is something worth thinking about.</p>
<p>Overall <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> is an amazing book. It offers insight that people of all walks of life can and should learn from. I am very happy that I read it and I recommend that adults read this book.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there are many lessons in the book that can help keep as many  as possible, &#8220;chosen&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>There will be one more future post about this book forthcoming.</em></p>

I have heard of it but have never seen it. It doesn&#8217;t sound very good. But apparently it&#8217;s pretty popular. I would imagine for all the train-wreck TV fans out there, this is the perfect show.</p>
<p>The show finds horrible home cooks, teaches them culinary skills and pits them against each other in cooking competitions. One of the contestants was introduced to the viewers via his burnt cholent. Joshie Berger grew up in Boro Park and his family is Chasidic. These days Joshie is not Chasidic at all.<span id="more-3871"></span></p>
<p>The Atlantic has an article noting some of Joshie&#8217;s finer moments on the show. The article is mostly positive. But not positive in a Jewish sense. It is positive in a cultural sense. The author commends Joshie for stepping outside his comfort zone and eating shellfish. In fact Joshie is portrayed as one who is reluctant to eat non-kosher foods. The article says a &#8220;highpoint of this past season&#8221; was when Joshie overcame his aversion to treyf.</p>
<p>Some high point.</p>
<p>Joshie was a quick learner and in the end he came out on top.</p>
<p>It can be very hard for those who leave Chasidic Judaism to succeed on the outside. They have a limited education, limited social skills that are needed on the outside and they speak English as a second language. So for Joshie to emerge victorious is in fact quite impressive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also nice that, according to the article, Joshie&#8217;s old friends were rooting for him to win.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that when reading the article my stomach turned several times because of Joshie&#8217;s choices that led him away from his heritage. It&#8217;s sad.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one thing that Joshie has been preaching that is absolutely correct. Orthodox Jews need to eat better. Amen to that.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows about technology, knows that the latest and greatest gadgets are all in Las Vegas right now for the consumer electronics show. The Atlantic is covering the show and found something they deemed newsworthy that is not directly related to &#8220;Consumer Electronics&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are chasidic Jews at the show.</p>
<p>Chasidic Judaism is often misdefined as &#8220;Ultra-Orthodox Judaism. It&#8217;s not. It is simply a way of life that focuses on the spirituality of the world and comes with a certain dress code. The men keep their beards, wear long coats and fur hats on holy days. But within chasidic Judaism, some are more &#8220;pious&#8221; than others. Being a chasidic Jew does not mean that one is more religious or more holy. It is a way of Jewish life that provides opportunities for religiousness or holiness, just like any other.</p>
<p><span id="more-3619"></span>At CES, the chasidic Jews are not developing new products. That would take an expertise that nearly all chasidic Jews do not have (ie heavy training in engineering and technology). Instead they are there as the classic Jewish middlemen. Using their connections and (hopefully) trustworthiness to develop relationships that can get them good prices on electronic goods and sell them to the marketplace at a fair price.</p>
<p>I think it is a common error to assume that chasidic Jews do not have regular jobs. True, there are scarcely any chasidic Jews who are professionals. College and secondary education are shunned. But nearly all chasidic Jews work. They are small business owners, they work in the services industry and they wheel and deal as middlemen.</p>
<p>I am proud that chasidic Jews are at CES. One of the men at the show was asked by the Atlantic if being chasidic impacts his business. He replied: <em>&#8220;People look at us as very honest people&#8221;</em>. That&#8217;s more important than any degree or faux religousness.</p>
<p>That is called making a kiddush Hashem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1665 alignleft" title="The Good Wife Unorthodox" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/The-Good-Wife-Unorthodox.jpg?resize=240%2C159" alt="The Good Wife Unorthodox" data-recalc-dims="1" />The Good Wife is a new legal drama on CBS. The show is great. Usually the legal issues are portrayed correctly (at least from a law student&#8217;s perspective) and the character development of the main character has been superb.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s episode revolved around a chasidic couple living in Chicago who were responsible to fix a fallen eruv wire, but since it fell on Shabbos they had to wait until Shabbos had ended and in the meantime a woman claims she fell over the wire and is suing for 1.2 million dollars in punitive damages. The title of the episode does not refer to the couple, rather it refers to their lawyer with an unorthodox approach to law.</p>
<p>Read on for my comments, critiques and a HUGE PLOT HOLE.<span id="more-1664"></span></p>
<p>The defense is based on the 1st Amendment, freedom of speech, and claims that the couple has the right to practice their religion and a jury should decide if they are liable when they believe it would be wrong for them to fix the eruv wire. That defense fails when the wife (a recent baalas tshuva / one who returns to Orthodox Judaism later in life) is found to have been making phone calls to her father on Shabbos. If she calls her father on Shabbos she should also be able to fix the fallen wire. Ultimately, the defense shows that the entire slip and fall was concocted and the jury finds for the defense.</p>
<p>You can read a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/11/10/the-good-wife-season-1-episode-7-unorthodox-tv-recap/" target="_blank">full synopsis of the episode here</a> or, even better, you can watch the show (at least for the time being) on <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/the_good_wife/video/?pid=mqlTZ0z2Bdu4VcCYOBCTZuNSrGL4052M&amp;vs=Default&amp;play=true" target="_blank">CBS.com</a>.</p>
<p>The portrayal of the chasidic community, the laws of eruv and the relationship between the chasidic couple were pretty good. BUt there were a few things that they got wrong. It is so funny to me that any orthodox Jew would notice the nuances that are incorrect but the entire staff of the show does not see the mistakes. Ironically, last week&#8217;s episode of The Good Wife revolved around a witness who could not tell the difference between 2 black men. It seems that people from other ethnicities have a hard time seeing the nuances of other ethnicities. It is no different when Hollywood tries to portrays Jews. They simply don&#8217;t have the sensitivities to the finer details of orthodox Judaism, especially chasidic Judaism.</p>
<h3>Things They Got Mostly Correct</h3>
<p>The chasidic garb. She was wearing typical women&#8217;s dress. Subdued colors and very modest. He was in black and white with his hat nearby at all times.</p>
<p>Strollers. Everyone had strollers in the chasidic neighborhood.</p>
<p>Kosher markets. There was a kosher market within walking distance.</p>
<p>The shomrim guy. He looked like every non-chasidic Hatzalah (Jewish volunteer ambulance core) guy I know.</p>
<p>The intimacy between the couple. Most couples on the show celebrate victory with public hugs and kisses. The chasidic couple did not embrace in public, but their connection was displayed by touching each other&#8217;s hands secretly.</p>
<h3>Mistakes</h3>
<p>The chasidic guy never smiles. That is just not nice.</p>
<p>The chasidic guy has a &#8220;tchup&#8221;(coiffed hair), chasidic men have hair that is cut very short.</p>
<p>The chasidic guy has a trimmed beard, that is not common at all.</p>
<p>The chasidic guy has a RING! (I mean, come on, that&#8217;s an easy one!)</p>
<p>They say an eruv &#8220;creates a <em>symbolic courtyard</em>&#8220;, that&#8217;s not quite true, an eruv joins many domains into one common domain by surround the entire community with a wall. (But that is a hard one.)</p>
<p>A young chasidic boy has a leather kipa perched awkwardly on the back of his head.</p>
<h3>Something That Bothered Me</h3>
<p>The wife was a twice rehabbed drug loving party girl who found chasidic Judaism while incarcerated. Showing her revival as a chasidic Jewish woman bothered me slightly. It was if to say, one has to be so crazy to find chasidic Judaism attractive. Maybe I am nitpicking, but it bothered me just a little.</p>
<h3>HUGE PLOT HOLE</h3>
<p>When the plaintiff got injured it was Shabbos. She was asked why she was walking through this neighborhood and she said she was going to the market. She was asked why this market if there are four markets closer to her home and she said because this market is the kosher market where they sell gluten free products.</p>
<p>Do you see the problem? (answer below)</p>
<p>This is an inexcusable error. CBS, next time you want to do a show with chasidic or Orthodox Jewish characters and plot elements you can hire me. I will be your rabbinical consultant and make sure you get it right.</p>
<p>The Good Wife is a great show. One of the reasons it is great is not the attention to detail. A twitter buddy of mine also noticed a legal problem a few weeks ago. I guess when you are law student and a Rabbi you are going to notice the mistakes of Jewish culture and law.</p>
<p>(Plot hole answer: The kosher market is <em>closed</em> on Shabbos. She could never be walking to a kosher market on Shabbos!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/elevator-story.html" target="_blank">This post has been cross-posted to DovBear</a>. &#8211; more discussion there.</strong></em></p>
<p>In addition to my work as the Rabbi at <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center at the </a><a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Shul</a><a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank"> on the Beach</a> I am also a Law Student at <a href="http://lls.edu">Loyola Law School</a> in Los Angeles. I am part of the evening program and completed my first year of evening classes in May.</p>
<p>In December I was subjected to mid-terms in each of my courses. Many Law School exams are long fact patterns that require the student to analyze the facts and apply all the law that is relevant to the facts and then argue why the law should or should not apply to those facts. Usually these fact patterns are fiction and these essays are typically 3 &#8211; 4 hours in duration.</p>
<p>My torts professor gave us a very interesting fact pattern. The basics of the case were, two young boys named Israel and Jacob enter an elevator on their way to school. Along the way the elevator malfunctions and the boys are suspended between the 10th and 11th floor. The doors malfunction as well and the doors are opened. The younger boy, Jacob is 5 and he tries to jump from the stuck elevator to the 10th floor below. Jacob jumps and <span id="more-783"></span>does not &#8220;<a href="http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/stick_the_landing_1/" target="_blank">stick the landing</a>&#8220;. Unfortunately, he stumbles off the 10th floor and plummeted 10 stories beneath the elevator down the shaft to his death. Israel is eventually rescued.</p>
<p>There were many more legally operative facts in the fact pattern and our professor wanted us to analyze the claims against the building landlord, owner and elevator maintenance company.</p>
<p>It was a pretty shocking case for all of us. When we returned to school after the break our professor told us that the fact pattern was basically a true story with some of the facts changed to make a clearer essay. Immediately I &#8220;googled&#8221; &#8220;Jacob Israel Elevator&#8221;. I found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/nyregion/20fall.html?scp=33&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt" target="_blank">the original NY Times article with the tragic story</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Times had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/nyregion/13elevator.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;sq=elevator&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1" target="_blank">another article on the ongoing litigation</a>. Apparently, the defense wants young Israel, who is 10 and traumatized to testify. This is horrible as any memories of the tragedy could alter his psychological well being tremendously. The case is being litigated as you read this.</p>
<p>I told this entire saga to two people I know. They are both very caring and sensitive people. They both had the same reaction and that reaction is what prompted this post.</p>
<p>When I told the story over, both people had serious looks on their faces and clearly empathized with the poor child.</p>
<p>Then I told them, by the way, the little boys were <em>Chasidish children from Williamsburg</em>.</p>
<p>They both had the same second reaction. Their jaws dropped and they exclaimed <em>Oy! That&#8217;s terrible</em>! A much harsher reaction reaction than before they knew the boys&#8217; ethnicity.</p>
<p>At first I was disturbed. Do we care more about some poor Chasidish kids from Williamsburg than anyone else? Is this tragedy worse to us because they are Jewish?</p>
<p>Is this a good attitude? Could this bother non-Jews and provoke anti-semitism?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps it is normal for us to care more about our Jewish brethren. Maybe, we should feel more compassion for our fellow Jews. After all, it is a rule of Jewish law that we are responsible for one another.</p>
<p>This has been gnawing at me for a little while now. Should we care more about a Jewish tragedy than a non-Jewish tragedy?</p>
<p>Even if we are allowed to care more about a Jewish tragedy should we try and mask our feelings to be more politically correct?</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t we outraged when non-Jews do not care about Jewish tragedy as much as non-Jewish tragedy?</p>
