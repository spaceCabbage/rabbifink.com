				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1134" title="Ethics" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/law7-300x239.gif" alt="Ethics" width="300" height="239" />Lawyers take the brunt of  a lot of <a href="http://www.lawlaughs.com/money/legalethics.html" target="_blank">jokes</a> and <a href="http://www.lawlaughs.com/honesty/howmuch.html" target="_blank">jabs</a> questioning their ethics.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Law Schools actually teach Ethical Lawyering and every student is required to pass that class prior to taking the bar.</p>
<p>Law blog <a href="http://legalgeekery.com/" target="_blank">Legal Geekery</a> (recommended reading for law students) has an article criticizing the way Law Schools attempt to teach ethics to future lawyers.</p>
<p><span id="more-1131"></span>In short, the argument goes (<a href="http://legalgeekery.com/2009/09/09/law-school-ethic/" target="_blank">read here</a>), by testing law students with proctors in the room, law students are not taught how to make ethical choices. Also, exams are taken on a software that locks the test taker&#8217;s computer while they take the exam. Instead, the schools should trust students the same way they will need to be trusted when they are in the work force with no proctor watching them. By watching every move the students make, Law Schools in effect, leave Law Students unprepared for the &#8220;real world&#8221;.</p>
<p>It got me thinking. Judaism is full of rules and regulations. The Torah is basically a really tough rule book. Does keeping the Torah&#8217;s laws help one become more ethical? Using the argument on Legal Geekery, the answer is no. Just because I act ethically because I fear retribution does not help me make ethical decisions when there is no fear of retribution.</p>
<p>But I disagree. I think practice makes <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">perfect</span> better. The Torah and its commandments are practice for the not-directly-related-Torah world when we do not have explicit rules and regulations to abide by. When we train our minds and bodies to act a certain way those thoughts and actions can become second nature. Second nature is pretty powerful. In fact, I recently mentioned in a Sermon that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyah_Lopian" target="_blank">Rabbi Elyah Lopian</a> held that second nature is stronger that our inborn tendencies. Our inborn tendencies are more easily changed than our bad or good habits. That is why good habits are so important. Rabbi Lopian explains that the commandments are tools for developing those good habits.</p>
<p>I see some strong parallels to Law School.</p>
<p>Law School is about developing good habits for Law Practice. Developing good habits for reading and briefing cases and developing good habits for analyzing facts and policies are what Law School is all about. Ethical Lawyering is the same. Developing good habits in ethics is good &#8220;practice&#8221; for &#8220;practice&#8221;. Doing your own work, solving problems on your own and using only permissible resources are good practice for becoming an ethical lawyer. Making honesty a habit will serve you well in practice. When ethics become second nature we can take away the training wheels and let you ride on your own with no proctor.</p>
<p>The proctor is training you. If you practice, you will make honesty second nature.</p>
