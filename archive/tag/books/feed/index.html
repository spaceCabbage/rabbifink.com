				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A couple years back I compiled a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/06/rational-reading-and-gift-list/" target="_blank">list of my favorite books that explore and inform the rationalist Orthodox Jewish world</a>. Many people have thanked me for the list, but I get the sense that people think I never read or never have read books that would not fit into the rationalist category. These would be books of Chasidus, stories of inspiration, and mystically influenced philosophy.</p>
<p>But I have read many of those books and many of them have influenced me in a very positive way. So I continue to recommend these books for people seeking more mainstream and less controversial paths within Orthodox Judaism. Some of the books on this list are just one of several favorites from a particular author and I simply chose one of many options. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with everything in these books, but I do think that they are worth reading and they have all influenced my thinking at some time in my life.<span id="more-7832"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060930853/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060930853&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7835" alt="books_gift" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/books_gift-600x450.jpg" width="420" height="315" />The Committed Life: Principles for Good Living from Our Timeless Past</a> is my favorite book from this genre. I recommend it at least once per week to people seeking to appreciate the soul of Judaism. This is emotional, relationship oriented Judaism at its best. Rebbetzin Jungreis shares wisdom, stories, humor, and love in this book. I probably read it a dozen times. It&#8217;s a must read.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0933711174/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0933711174&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Generation to Generation: Personal Recollections of a Chassidic Legacy</a> is my favorite book of Chasidic stories. Rabbi Twerski weaves together lessons from his Chasidic pedigree into a book that is inspiring and educational. I&#8217;ve read this book a few times and don&#8217;t know of a better book in this genre.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067972043X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=067972043X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust</a> is a famous collection of stories from the Holocaust. Yaffa Eliach wrote this book 25 years ago and it remains the premier book in this genre. I used to read it every Tisha B&#8217;Av. It&#8217;s a tough book but the stories are mostly hopeful and inspirational.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0899068669/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0899068669&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology: Illuminating Expositions on Jewish Thought and Practice</a> is a great Aryeh Kaplan starter kit. So much as his work has become part of the basic philosophy of moderate Orthodox Judaism. His books are footnoted and very well researched. He takes a modern mystical approach to Torah and Mitzvos and gives compelling reasons and explanations for being an Orthodox Jew. He was a prolific writer and I recommend just about all of his books. &#8220;If You Were God&#8221; is one of my favorites so I chose this anthology. I&#8217;ve read this book a few times too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0873068653/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0873068653&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Jewish Self</a> is a bit kiruvy, but I written on a very sophisticated level. Rabbi Kagan is known to be extremely intelligent and this book is not an easy read. It&#8217;s written to be intellectual. It succeeds in parts and was too obscure for me in others. But I recommend it because it is the opposite of &#8220;dumbing down&#8221; Judaism. It&#8217;s a challenge to read this book and it inspired me when I read it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/096147727X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=096147727X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Pichifkes: Stories Heard on the Road and by the Way</a> is my favorite Hanoch Teller book. The epitome of feel good, positive, Orthodox Jewish storytelling, this book has a bunch of really great stories. It&#8217;s a very light read, and clearly Teller is loose with the facts, and heavy on embellishments. But he is good at his craft and I must have read this book 8-10 times.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568710801/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1568710801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Worldmask</a> changed my life when I read it in high school. I no longer subscribe to the views Rabbi Tatz teaches in this book, but for one who does, there is no better book on God&#8217;s place in our world. I devoured all of Rabbi Tatz&#8217;s writings in my teens and I read each of his books several times. I think Worldmask is his best work and aside from the stylistic issues that make it hard to read for some people, it&#8217;s an excellent book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/089906115X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=089906115X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Reb Simcha Speaks: Rabbi Simcha Wasserman&#8217;s Insights and Teachings on Vital Principles of Life and Faith</a> is the best Artscroll biography on the market. It&#8217;s actually co-authored by Rabbi Tatz and Yaakov Branfman, so Rabbi Tatz makes this list twice. The book tells the story of the great Rabbi Simcha Wasserman but mostly it makes one feel like they are hearing R&#8217; Simcha speak, hence the title. It&#8217;s a collection of some of his very wise teachings. I don&#8217;t agree with everything in the book, but so much of my life was inspired by this book that it may have been one of the most influential reads of my entire life. I&#8217;ve read it about half a dozen times and my copy of the book has underlines and dog eared pages. It&#8217;s a good book.</p>
<p>So there you have eight books that influenced and inspired me at some point in my life. These are not rationalist books at all. They are the kinds of books your Rosh Yeshiva or rabbi would certainly endorse. So if you are looking for Chanukah gifts for a reader in your life you would appreciate some of the best writing within the more widely accepted views of Orthodox Judaism, here you go.</p>
<p>BONUS BOOK</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140278631X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=140278631X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Out of the Depths: The Story of a Child of Buchenwald Who Returned Home at Last</a> is Rabbi Lau&#8217;s story. It&#8217;s one of the best books I&#8217;ve ever read of any genre and belongs on every Jewish bookshelf. It&#8217;s not really a Torah book per se, it&#8217;s much more of a memoir, but it&#8217;s very inspiring and I strongly recommend it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7033" alt="library-books" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books-298x300.jpg" width="298" height="300" /></a>There are several dozen prohibitions in the Torah that relate to idol worship. Writing in the 12th century, Maimonides stridently warns against studying the texts of idolatry or even learning about idol worship. (Hilchos Avodas Kochavim 2:2)</p>
<p>The argument against interfacing with idol worship is that the human mind is drawn towards the things that one studies. One is not always in perfect control of what one thinks and what one wants. So even if one is studying for the sake of satisfying curiosity, or even learning to rebut, one may be drawn toward idol worship. Maimonides extends this law to include heresy as well.</p>
<p>This is all kinds of depressing. Under this view, it can be extremely dangerous to study anything one does not already believe because whatever one studies for whatever reason can have a very negative influence. While it might be interesting to debate or dispute this assumption, I think there is a great positive lesson to be learned as well.<span id="more-7032"></span></p>
<p>If we are drawn toward the &#8220;wrong&#8221; things by studying them, we can also be drawn to the &#8220;right&#8221; things by studying them. If we want to be more drawn to our Judaism, we can jumpstart ourselves by studying Torah. It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything specific, it can be anything. I think a lot of people study things that they don&#8217;t enjoy and that causes them to want to study less. We would be wise to broaden the scope of what we study as a collective unit and give more people more opportunities to find things they enjoy studying. One doesn&#8217;t have to study the familiar texts. Study whatever Jewish texts you want. It seems that when one learns about anything, one is drawn toward that thing. We want to be more drawn to our Judaism. Let&#8217;s study.</p>
<p>Studying Torah is valuable for so many reasons. This just seems like another side benefit.</p>
<p>This is the most important thing we can do to keep ourselves, children, and communities on the path of Judaism. Study. We are the People of the Book and it is our duty to study and know the Book. Judaism requires us to be knowledgeable. But learning about Judaism seems like good advice anyway, even for people who are already quite observant. We should study things that we want to be drawn toward. Study Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Burning-book-001-450x270.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6535" title="Burning-book-001-450x270" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Burning-book-001-450x270-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a>Books were one of the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Personal Torah libraries in private homes and public Torah libraries in institutions were irreparably damaged by the raging waters.</p>
<p>The Jewish people are the People of the Book and our books are revered. We don&#8217;t simply learn from books, we treat books with respect and (in a non-creepy way), we almost give them the respect an important person would receive. Books are kissed when we put them away, we don&#8217;t leave our books open when we are not studying, we prominently display our books in our homes, we spend time each day studying the books, and when books are no longer able to be used we bury the books. Our books have been burned by our enemies and we cry over those tragedies almost as we would cry over human death. We have burned our own books and we regret those incidents. Our books are precious and we are very aware of their importance in our lives.</p>
<p>A huge number of books were destroyed in the hurricane. They deserved a proper send-off and at Yeshiva Darchei Torah in Far Rockaway the books received an appropriate farewell. The students and rabbis participated in a ceremonial funeral as they sent the books to be buried.<span id="more-6531"></span></p>
<p>The unspoken message to the students and the rabbis and to the rest of us is that our books are the basic building blocks of Judaism. In our books, the words of our Torah scholars live on and in turn they give us life. While Judaism cannot be relegated to an encyclopedia, instead it must be lived and alive. The pursuit of Torah knowledge and expertise in order to live that life is so vital to our success that the books themselves are larger than life. The books deserve our respect and our attention. We can never forget that we are called the people of the book and we must earn the title by doing our very best to know what it says in our books.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/newsweek-heaven.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6348" title="newsweek heaven" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/newsweek-heaven-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="300" /></a>Newsweek&#8217;s cover story last week was basically an advertisement for a book written by a doctor who claims to have seen heaven. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/10/07/proof-of-heaven-a-doctor-s-experience-with-the-afterlife.html" target="_blank">According to his personal account</a>, he was in a coma when he saw heaven and met fairies and angels along the way. He is convinced that this was a real place and a real experience and has written a book telling his story.</p>
<p>I have two things to say about this story and they are completely unrelated.</p>
<p>First, the claim in and of itself.</p>
<p>Reading the good doctor&#8217;s narrative is almost as entertaining as it is frustrating. The heaven he visits is coincidentally enough, exactly like a human would imagine it. White puffy clouds, soft soothing voices, lots of love, and he describes it as more &#8220;real&#8221; than the day of his own wedding and birth of his sons. He claims that his brain could not have generated the images or experience because he was in a certain type of coma. The punchline of his claim is that consciousness is independent of brain activity and when we die our consciousness lives on in a perfect world. He adds that since he was a skeptical Christian it must be that this was real because he would not have imagined it on his own.</p>
<p>Obviously, these are very specious claims.</p>
<p><span id="more-6347"></span></p>
<p>There is nothing in the article or in his story that carries any weight in convincing a skeptic that heaven exists. This sounds no different than any other fantastic claim. The only difference is that this fellow is a doctor and he seems to think this is a really big deal. As if to say that doctors would never believe in something without evidence and therefore he should be taken more seriously than a clergyman with the same claims.</p>
<p>An appeal to authority if I ever saw one.</p>
<p>I am not a neuroscientist. But Sam Harris is a neuroscientist and he debunks the sloppy science of the article. Read that here (this article safe for <em>ma&#8217;aminim bnei ma&#8217;aminim)</em> <a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/this-must-be-heaven" target="_blank">SamHarris.org</a>.</p>
<p>The more interesting question to me is what an orthodox Jew should think about this story.</p>
<p>Due to a fairly recent shift in political alignment and ideology, more and more orthodox Jews find themselves copacetic with fundamentalist Christians. There are many shared beliefs and ideals between the two groups thus creating a feeling of &#8220;what&#8217;s good for them is good for us&#8221; among orthodox Jews. That might be true sometimes. Some people think it is true all of the time.</p>
<p>This story is an example of where we must diverge. If orthodox Judaism is correct, and we believe it is, this doctor&#8217;s account must be wrong. We don&#8217;t believe in ethereally lovely looking women who make us fall in love with them as we float toward a place that teaches, “You have nothing to fear. There is nothing you can do wrong.” We disagree. We do have something to fear and we can do things that are wrong. We are supposed to fear God and God&#8217;s judgment and we can do things wrong. Our job is to make the right choices. We get judged when we die.If an orthodox Jew believes this account of heaven, the orthodox Jew must also believe our beliefs on the afterlife are wrong. Now certainly there is very little canonized material on the afterlife in Judaism. But there is also an extreme reluctance among orthodox Jews to discard cherished beliefs, even if they are not mandatory beliefs.</p>
<p>So, this article is an affront to orthodox Judaism and all non-Christians. We don&#8217;t accept their view of heaven by virtue of our own appeal to authority. It does not help our cause to promote this article nor does it present anything of value to the orthodox Jew. I read it as an advertisement for a man&#8217;s book that he believes is true but that&#8217;s only because he has been fooled by his own religion and hyperactive subconscious.</p>
<p>I hope Newsweek is being compensated well for this advertisement for a book and for Christianity because they completely sold out.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, as a I noted on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10101148965805145" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, Newsweek&#8217;s print edition is dying at the end of 2012, maybe this was they moment in the foxhole where they decided to believe in heaven&#8230;</p>

It&#8217;s a really great book and a full review is forthcoming. Something struck me as I was reading the book that is relevant to Israeli politics. In light of the UNGA I thought I would share my observations.</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles to peace in Israel is purportedly &#8220;the refugee problem&#8221;. Thousands of Arabs were displaced from their homes during the wars of 1948 and 1967. They hope to return to their homes which are now occupied by Israel. Those thousands of refugess have morphed into millions of refugees over the years.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616200405/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1616200405&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Aleppo Codex</a>, we learn one particular Jewish community in an Arab country, Aleppo Syria. As in many Arab countries, the Jews of Aleppo Syria dated back to Second Temple era over 2000 years ago. There were many ancient Jewish communities in Arab lands. Unlike the regular persecution threat to life that Jews experienced in Europe, many Jews in the Arab lands thrived as members of society. It is fascinating to read about a completely different social experience in the Arab lands than my personal history and heritage from the European lands.<span id="more-6293"></span></p>
<p>That all changed when the State of Israel was born. In response to the Jewish state, many citizens of Arab countries rioted and made life very uncomfortable for the Jews living in those countries. Although no one was killed in Aleppo, the Jews felt unsafe and had to flee. The same thing happened in other Arab countries. The Jewish homes were looted and Jews were forced to leave.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. Why is this never mentioned? The Palestinian refugees are not the only people who lost their homes when the State of Israel was granted to the Jewish people. All the Jewish communities in the Arab countries lost their homes as well! The entire Syrian community of Brooklyn and Deal, NJ is a big refugee camp. The Persian community of Los Angeles are a giant refugee camp too! And there are many others.</p>
<p>My point is quite simple. Yes, it is true that many Arabs lost their homes in 1948 and 1967. But hundreds of thousands of Jews lost their homes as well.</p>
<p>This means two things. Thousands of years of wandering has taught our people how to pack up and start over somewhere new. Not everyone is capable of doing this. Preventing people from starting over with [false] hope that they will get their homes back from half a century ago is a form of tyranny. It also means that any conversation about refugees &#8220;returning&#8221; should begin with a modest proposal that the Jews who were ousted from Arab lands get their homes back as well.</p>
<p>Like I said, the book is excellent. Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616200405/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1616200405&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Aleppo Codex: A True Story of Obsession, Faith, and the Pursuit of an Ancient Bible</a> and stay tuned for the full review.</p>

What do I know?</p>
<p>Before I even cracked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> open I had a basic idea of what to expect. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is designed to be an avant garde hagaddah. It is artistic in an almost postmodern way, it is typographically pleasing, the commentary is meant to inspire American Jews, and it was not orthodox. The commentary was written by Jeffrey Goldberg, Lemony Snicket, Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, and Nathaniel Deutsch. The translation was done by Nathan Englander. The hagaddah was edited by  Jonathan Safran Foer.</p>
<p>One of the things I was looking for in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> was whether it would be acceptable to orthodox Jews. Was there anything that would offend the orthodox Jewish adherence to halacha and general worldview? Another thing I wondered was if the commentary was any good without considering the blood pressure of orthodox Jews. The last thing I wanted to see about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> was if I would enjoy its presentation of the haggadah and Seder experience.</p>
<p>So on Shabbos afternoon I read through the whole thing.<span id="more-5315"></span> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> has three basic functions. There is the text of the haggadah in the original Hebrew plus a contemporary English translation. There is a running timeline of Jewish history with a focus on Passover, that is completely independent of the hagaddah and Passover narrative that runs through the haggadah. There is also a collection of essays and food for thought during the highlights of the haggadah. Throughout the haggadah, instructions and laws are outlined and they are accurate enough. The specific amounts of the portions is not precise. They are not wrong. They are just vague.</p>
<p>My impressions of the text and translation is overwhelmingly positive. The text is true to the orthodox Jewish tradition. This was reassuring. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, but since the Seder has taken on many different iterations throughout modernity, I had a healthy concern that the text would be different than what I was used to. Fortunately, this is not an issue at all.</p>
<p>My next area of concern was the translation. I must say that I was thoroughly impressed with the translation as well. It is a combination of beautiful English, devotion to tradition, and appropriate modern adjustments. One novel translation was in the response to the Wicked Son. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> translates this section by saying (emphasis mine) &#8220;&#8230;And by divorcing himself from the community he denies <em>our very essence. </em>Moreover, you must <em>blunt the bite of his words</em>, by telling him&#8230;&#8221; This is not the exact translation that most orthodox Jews would use, but it is true to the text and insightful. A second example of a novel translation is found in &#8220;V&#8217;Hi She&#8217;amda&#8221;. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds a poetic nuance in &#8220;For it was not one alone who stood over us, a heel on our necks, bent on our annihilation&#8230;&#8221; I found that one to be a nice touch. One last thing that stuck out was the adjustment from the oft used &#8220;simple son&#8221; to the &#8220;artless son&#8221;. This is perhaps no better than &#8220;simple&#8221; but &#8220;simple&#8221; horribly simplistic as well. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds one section of text that I had not seen previously. At the time that we fill the &#8220;fifth cup&#8221; and open the door for Shfoch Chamascha, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds a couple of verses from Tanach about Elijah the Prophet. I had not seen that before. It offends me, but only slightly, because the idea that Elijah the Prophet visits us when we open the door for Shfoch Chamascha is of questionable vintage and certainly not universally held. All in all, the text and translations were outstanding.</p>
<p>The most problematic part of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> for orthodox Jews is the &#8220;timeline&#8221;. It is highly academic and may, at times, offend orthodox sensibilities. Further, its focus on secular Jewish accomplishments are of little to no value to most orthodox Jewish Seders. One would be hard pressed to actually find anything that would be called &#8220;kefira&#8221; in the timeline, but I can see it being a source of discomfort for many orthodox Jews. I liked most of it.</p>
<p>As for the commentary, it was a lot better than I expected. The gist of the commentary could best be described as a fresh, relevant commentary. It is heavy on take-away lessons that apply in 2012 and light on rabbinic interpretation. However the rabbis of the Talmud and beyond do make several appearances.</p>
<p>If I had to point to its biggest flaw, I would say that at times it is too irreverent of God. Orthodox Jews will cringe at a few of the essays because they paint a picture of God that is not completely in sync with the contemporary orthodox Jewish views of God and His role in the world.</p>
<p>Still, many of the essays portray excellent ideas written in excellent prose that will surely spur a discussion of the haggadah that is familiar to orthodox Jews. For example, speaking of being &#8220;chosen&#8221;, one essay proclaims &#8220;Chosenness can sometimes feel like loneliness; a burden. Perhaps it is for this reason, the haggadah reminds us that our chosenness is an expression of love and a source for rejoicing.&#8221; Sounds like something an orthodox rabbi would say. Commenting on our statement that &#8220;today we are slaves&#8221; the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> asks the obvious question: But we are not slaves today? And answers that our impoverishment is our inability to do all the good that we want to do in our lives. If I told you that was from R&#8217; Yisrael Salanter, you would believe me. But it is not. It is from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a>. Another insight that sounds like a classic is the proposal that the plague that kills all the firstborns of Egypt is a &#8220;measure for measure&#8221; for the Egyptian decree to drown all the baby boys into the Nile. I am sure that others have said this as well. The point is that the commentary sometimes takes on the persona of the traditional orthodox Jewish commentators. There are other nice little &#8220;vorts&#8221; sprinkled throughout the commentary. Like the parallel between the hiding of the Afikomen and the hiding of Moshe as a baby that led to our salvation.</p>
<p>But there are two other kinds of commentary in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> that are bound to rankle some orthodox Jewish sensibilities. One is justified and the other might not be. There are a very small number of essays that may be objectively problematic. For example, one essay proposes that just like us, sometimes God forgets about people other than Himself. Ouch. But other than that, the irreverence and nonchalant tone about God and the Passover story are rarely objectively offensive, if at all.</p>
<p>The most common form of commentary in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is an anathema to most orthodox Jewish Seders, I think. That is, an attempt to take the lessons of the Seder and apply them to society at large, particularly, with a Tikkun Olam flavor. Personally, I think orthodox Jews should not recoil at the mere mention of Tikkun Olam, but many do. For example, one essay remarks that Shifra and Puah are the first examples of &#8220;civil disobedience&#8221;. This is a great point and definitely something to think about. However, few orthodox Jews will find meaning in spending precious moments at the Seder talking about it. Another essay tells a great story about Palestinian prisoners eating matzah on Passover because that is what they were served and invites questions about prison, the Intifada, and Israel. One humorous comparison pits Elijah the Prophet against Santa Claus. Both &#8220;visit&#8221; homes but Santa is forced to go through the Chimney. We stand up and open the door for Elijah. Again, a great conversation starter, but not the kind of conversation that one would expect at an orthodox Jewish Seder. But then again, maybe it should be. Our Seders are so focused on the past and interpretations from the past. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> has some great ways to bring the discussion into 2012 and that might be a good thing for some orthodox Jewish Seders.</p>
<p>In general, the preference of orthodox Jews is to quote rabbis and Torah scholars at the Seder. But as Maimonides famously said,&#8221;<a href="http://efink.tumblr.com/post/7246029090/maimonides-truth" target="_blank">Hear truth from whoever says it</a>&#8220;, I see nothing wrong with including the thoughts and ideas of a few American Jews who are not rabbis or even orthodox.</p>
<p>My only real critique is that in an attempt to be cool and hip, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> makes you turn the book on its side to read the essays and on its other side to read the timeline. Maybe I just don&#8217;t get it. But it is odd and quite annoying. I don&#8217;t see how it enhances the experience.</p>
<p>The verdict is that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is <em>acceptable</em> for orthodox Jews. It has some things to offer that will undoubtably improve your orthodox Jewish Seder. It has other things that will get ignored, but that may not be for the best. Some parts should be ignored, and that is okay too. I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> for most orthodox Jewish readers. If you want to avoid the most problematic essay skip the one that starts &#8220;God. who supposedly knows everything,&#8221;. Otherwise, to my eyes, the rest of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is completely safe. It may seem strange to discuss some of the things that are in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is wrong or a waste of time.</p>

It is unorthodox. It is a rejection. But I did not find it scandalous. Not at all.</p>
<p>There is so much about this book that needs to be discussed. Let&#8217;s get a bit of insignificant criticism out of the way. For starters, I found the writing decent. Not excellent. It got better as the book progressed, but the early chapters were tedious in my opinion. The writing is over-descriptive to a fault. Too many sentences have too many adjectives and adverbs. The book doesn&#8217;t allow the reader any imagination. There&#8217;s no room for the reader to breath. It&#8217;s sensory overload. It&#8217;s almost like the author is trying too hard to prove herself as a good writer. Personally, I found it quite annoying.</p>
<p>The story is unremarkable. Shorter version of the book: Girl raised by her grandparents because her mother is a lesbian who left the community and her father is mentally ill has high anxiety and feels constrained by the limiting lifestyle of her community eventually leaves the community. It&#8217;s not a story we haven&#8217;t heard before nor is it a story we will not hear again.</p>
<p>The truth is that anyone with high anxiety will not have an easy time in any tight-knit, insular community. It&#8217;s not really that chasidic Judaism didn&#8217;t work for Deborah. It&#8217;s that her difficult childhood and personality didn&#8217;t work well in the high pressure society of chasidic Judaism. She probably would have been fine in a more moderate form of orthodox Judaism. Unfortunately for her, she was born into extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Honestly, there was nothing &#8220;scandalous&#8221; in the book. (I will address the one scandal that has been manufactured at the end of this post).<span id="more-5177"></span> In other words, the book, fairly accurately describes the life of a chasidic girl in Williamsburg. It is insular. Education is placed at a minimum. Marriage is the goal of childhood, motherhood is the goal of adulthood. This is no scandalous. This is fact.</p>
<p>There are in fact, renegade renegade mikva attendants. There are libido charged teenage boys who are inappropriate toward girls (and other boys). There are stories of talking fish. People did burn their wigs. Secular books are frowned upon. Superstitions are rampant. People gossip. Especially about young married couples. There is abuse and it is covered up. There is prejudice against members of other chasidic sects and certainly against non-chasidic Jews, especially modern orthodox Jews and Sephardic Jews. Strange tales like eating pig will make you vomit are told. These are just the expected social conventions of the insular chasidic community. Nothing to see here.</p>
<p>But are these items an indictment of the entire chasidic community? Certainly not. Bad people and dumb ideas exist everywhere. The biggest gripe I have is simply the imaginary principle that there are no bad people or dumb ideas in the community. There are and knowing there are goes a long way to fixing those people and ideas.</p>
<p>The book brought me to tears twice. For a sap like me, that is not a good showing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> made me cry a ton of times. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen: The Hidden Lives of Hasidic Rebels</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0807036277&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> moved me to tears a bunch of times. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> was not an emotional book. The only moments for me were the birth of her child and the when she and her son come to grips with the fact that the unhappy, broken, marriage is over. That&#8217;s it. The rest felt a bit detached and unremarkable.</p>
<p>But I like to find social commentary and universal lessons in this kind of book and I think there are some important issues the book raises.</p>
<p>Deborah&#8217;s personality is to question and to learn. In her community this is a dangerous trait. Her first step off the path was learning Talmud. That&#8217;s an innocent curiosity in most orthodox communities, even for a girl. But Deborah had to hide it. She couldn&#8217;t ask questions about what she had learned. With this her rebellion began.</p>
<p>Although Deborah relates to her grandmother as a rebel. I don&#8217;t think she realized how special her grandfather was. At least, what is recorded in the book paints Zaidy as a good guy. He avoids the Satmar politics. He is willing to read a newspaper after 9/11. He doesn&#8217;t believe in superstition and stories like the talking fish in New Square. He is also a bit of a rebel. In my eyes, Zaidy is a reasonable guy throughout most of the book. What&#8217;s unfortunate is one negative portrayal made its way onto the book jacket. But other than that incident, he seems to be a good guy. I think that his independence of allegiance and thought are worthy of praise and if more of his neighbors were like him, I think many issues in the insular community would be mitigated.</p>
<p>Her shortlived marriage leaves many unanswered questions. I would have liked more details. She says they fight. About what? The book doesn&#8217;t elaborate. She talks about their neighbors in Airmont. I am from Monsey, I know those people. I would have liked more about that period of her life. The life of what has become known as a &#8220;Tuna Beigel&#8221;. They dress somewhat chasidic but are much more liberated. Why didn&#8217;t that lifestyle work for Deborah? These are areas of the book that feel rushed and unfinished.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the book was the twist of fate that began with a visit to a Kabbalist. He told Deborah that her number was &#8220;nine&#8221;. On 9/9/9 just after midnight, Deborah had a life-changing motor vehicle accident. She says that the Kabbalist was right. Her number was nine. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think that is what the Kabbalist had in mind. But it&#8217;s poetic justice that his words were used by Deborah to rationalize her departure from the community.</p>
<p>The overall &#8220;lesson&#8221; of the book, if there is one, is that her whole life, as a good Chasidic girl, Deborah was taught to trust her intellect over her impulse. She was supposed to use her knowledge of Jewish law and thought to guide her and not allow her emotions and passions. Her freedom came when she put her impulse ahead of her intellect. Judaism is really all about placing one&#8217;s intellect above their impulse. Everyone from Maimonides to Luzzato talks about this. The trick is to channel one&#8217;s impulse into positive, creative, useful activity. One is not required to suppress everything about one&#8217;s self. Rather, one is supposed to use the intellect to guide one&#8217;s passions and creativity. The goal is to use one&#8217;s personality to improve the world.</p>
<p>More balanced, moderate forms of orthodox Judaism provide a better framework for avoiding this damaging problem. Most careers and opportunities are available to orthodox Jews. There are a few exceptions. Perhaps it would be useful for the more moderate versions of orthodox Judaism to focus on this aspect of Judaism. Even better, if the more insular versions of orthodox Judaism like the chasidic sects mentioned in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> or the new insular communities in the non-chasidic world would allow these doors to be opened for their communities.</p>
<p>There is somewhat of a happy ending to the book, even for religious, orthodox Jews. Feldman says that she is still proud to be a Jew. In a different sense than before, but still, she is not a &#8220;self hating Jew&#8221; as some have claimed. This is a positive development in light of her difficulties with her community,</p>
<p>To close, allow me to address what has become the biggest controversy over this book: The murder cover-up.</p>
<p>Feldman tells the story of her brother-in-law calling their home and telling them that a heinous murder had just occurred in Kiryas Joel. He was personally there as a Hatzalah member and he claimed that there was a cover-up of the murder.</p>
<p>In the book, the story is told as a rumor. The book makes no claim as to whether or not there was a murder. The only claim being made is that this is what she was told. The point of the story is to illustrate that no one would have a hard time believing that a murder was covered up. As a reader, I am deeply troubled that a rumor like this is even possible. But I did not ever think that Feldman was reporting on something with facts to back it up. This was a record of a conversation that she recalled. The issues that remain are not whether or not there was a murder. It is a much more basic issue. Whether or not a murder could or would be covered up. I don&#8217;t think anyone would find this impossible, what with all the cover-ups of sex abuse, domestic abuse, fraud and corruption. That is the real issue. Whether or not she should have investigated and looked at police reports is irrelevant in my opinion. I don&#8217;t think Feldman thought that including this anecdote in the book would be as scandalous as it has become. I would have preferred if the she had made it clearer that the episode was rumor. But that is how I took it.</p>
<p>In my opinion, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> is a good book. Some are calling it a chillul Hashem. I find this ironic. Here is a woman who left the community. She tells her story. The story seems entirely plausible. But because she left it is chillul Hashem. Yet, when people who stay in the communirty commit crimes, acts of violence, are unseemly for other reasons, that is not a chillul Hashem. Quite the double standard if you ask me. All communities have what I call &#8220;abhorrent beliefs&#8221;. Is it a chillul Hashem when our abhorrent beliefs or practices are exposed truthfully? That&#8217;s a hard question to answer.  More important is the challenge of dealing with them in a modern world. This will be addressed in a future post. Maybe even tomorrow.<em> (Update: Posted - <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/21/what-to-do-about-abhorrent-beliefs-in-religions/">What to Do About Abhorrent Beliefs in Religions?</a>).</em></p>
<p>Should you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a>? It&#8217;s interesting enough. Deborah&#8217;s story is unique enough to hold your interest. The inside information about the insular communities of Williamsburg and beyond is worth your time. If you are looking for high drama and massive scandals look elsewhere. It&#8217;s &#8220;good reading&#8221;. Not &#8220;can&#8217;t miss reading&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5100" title="51CKG07JF5L._SS500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/51CKG07JF5L._SS500_-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Menachem Kellner is a scholar par excellence. I enjoy his books, and other writings very much. One book that I particularly enjoyed was the provocatively titled: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a></p>
<p>The book is not really about what the title implies. Instead, the book is an analysis of required beliefs in Judaism. It is an excellent book and a joy to read. I heartily recommend the book to anyone interested in the evolution of fundamental beliefs in Judaism.</p>
<p>One important issue that is thoroughly discussed is the importance the Sages of the Mishna and Talmud placed on actions while placing less importance on faith or beliefs. This is true. But the significance of this fact is debatable. That is because faith or belief in a deity was a basic assumption of life in the era in which the Sages lived. One had to be insane to be an atheist 2000 years ago. How would one even begin to explain the world in which they lived. However, today one can certainly be sane and deny the existence of God. In fact, some might argue that the tables have turned and belief in God is the less sane position. After all, there is no scientific proof of an all-knowing, all-powerful Creator. So, while I enjoyed the discussion in the book about actions having more meaning than beliefs in the eyes of the Sages, how well that transfers to modern times is another discussion entirely.</p>
<p>Another core point of the book is that in adopting the 13 Fundamental Beliefs of Maimonides there is an odd irony.<span id="more-5099"></span> On the one hand, Maimonides the Rationalist lost. By this I mean that Judaism today is mostly not the Judaism of Maimonides. Today&#8217;s Judaism is dominated by metaphysics, mysticism, and Zohar-centric Kabbalah. The Judaism of Maimonides functioned without  these elements. (For a thorough analysis and discussion of this point see Kellner&#8217;s book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158">Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation with Mysticism</a>.) So Maimonides lost. He tried to establish a Judaism free from these non-essential elements but he failed. The public rejected his approach.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the public embraced the revolutionary suggestion of Maimonides that there are 13 fundamental beliefs and what those beliefs actually entail. There were other fundamental belief systems proposed by others and Judaism may have got along just fine without a formal expression of fundamental beliefs.</p>
<p>Yet, here we are today. The public has rejected rationalism and embraced fundamental beliefs. Isn&#8217;t it ironic?</p>
<p>The final part of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a> is a polemic. Kellner argues that it should be okay to relegate the 13 Fundamental Beliefs for the sake of Jewish Unity. His proposal is based on the assumption that Orthodox Jewish rabbis and non-rabbis avoid working with non-orthodox rabbis and non-rabbis. There is no conversation or joint agenda in which orthodox and non-orthodox Jews  participate. Further, Kellner assumes that this plain fact is because of the halachic prohibition that proscribes a believer from engaging with a heretic. The logic follows that since by the lights of the 13 Fundamental Principles there is a presumption that non-orthodox Jews are technically heretics. Hence, it is forbidden to engage them. This, according to Kellner is the reason there is no communication between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. Kellner then argues that for the sake of unity, continuity, and peace we should discard with a highly literal usage of Maimonides fundamental beliefs and open the lines of communication with non-orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>One might suspect that I would agree with Kellner on this matter. In principle I do. I wrote about it here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/">There is No Tent</a>. I think we should increase communication and interaction with all Jews. But I don&#8217;t agree with Kellner&#8217;s logic here. Not at all.</p>
<p>The reason there is little interaction between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews has very little to do with halacha. It has a lot to do with social concerns. The orthodox establishment is more concerned with their children and keeping their children orthodox than the nitty-gritty of whether or not it is permissible to engage with the non-orthodox. In other words, the real reason there is little interaction between the groups is because the orthodox are concerned about the influence that non-orthodox will have over their children or even themselves. It is a matter of insulation and isolation, not a matter of halacha.</p>
<p>And so, it makes little difference to the orthodox Jew that fundamentals of faith are a novel introduction by Maimonides or that there are other codes of faith that could be acceptable. What does matter is that access to a world of Judaism that does not follow the chain of halacha that is followed by orthodox Jews could &#8220;corrupt&#8221; orthodox Jews and they may jump ship. It is merely circling the wagons. It is not a halachic decision.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kellner&#8217;s ambitious and admirable suggestion is a non-starter. Unless the orthodox Jewish community can foster a confidence in its principles and ideals to the point that interaction is not considered a spiritual danger, I don&#8217;t foresee a change in approach. As a pure academic exercise, the recommendation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a> is bold and exciting to me. But in a practical sense, it is lacking.</p>
<p>The only way intra-Jewish relations will change significantly is if our leadership suggests that it has value and that value trumps overzealous concerns over assimilation. I hope it does change.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a> and thinking about its many fascinating points for discussion. If you have read it let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

I saw it just after I wrote about the modern day exorcist here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/28/demons-dybbuks-devils-and-exorcism/" target="_blank">Demons, Dybbuks, Devils and Exorcism</a>. Buying this book was a smart decision. I read the book a little while back and neglected to do a review but I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you all about this book since I read it.</p>
<p>The author, J.H Chajes, is a professor at University of Haifa. He is a distant relative of the great Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> is very scholarly and well researched. Yet, it reads like a novel, well almost like a novel, and it kept me engrossed in its content from start to finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> chronicles the rise of recorded incidents of dybbuks and exorcism in the era of mystical writings of the Arizal&#8217;s students. Most of the book takes place in the 16th and 17th centuries. The book traces the relationship between Christian, Muslim and Jewish exorcism legends and practice as well. An appendix has full accounts of exorcisms found in rabbinic literature from that era.</p>
<p>As a skeptic, I found the restraint of Chajes astounding. It is almost as if he is winking the entire time that he is writing about demonic / disembodied soul possession. You just know that he can&#8217;t believe what he is writing as fact is even possible. But he writes as an objective 3rd party about rabbis and others performing exorcisms with a straight face.</p>
<p>There are a few points that I took away from the book that are worth sharing.<span id="more-4968"></span> First of all, the book mentions some disputes between rabbis. They were vicious disagreements. Accusations of philandering, abject immorality and horrible insults are hurled the way of one particular rabbi. I can only imagine what our rabbinic disputes will look like to historians some time in the future. Fascinating to read and fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>Second, the book supports the theory that &#8220;the more knowledge becomes accessible, the more some religious leaders will try to &#8216;esotericize&#8217; their religion to maintain a level of separation between the masses and the public&#8221;. I know, that theory is a mouthful. With regard to exorcism it works as follows. The masses were becoming more literate throughout the world. Exorcism was an art reserved for spiritual leaders and scholars. It was not available to the masses no matter how learned they became. Thus, the existence of demons and dybbuks reinforced the need for leadership. It is similar to today&#8217;s maximalist position of Daas Torah. In a time that more orthodox Jews can study the sources and responsa on a given subject, the religious leaders have reserved a segment of inaccessible knowledge under the maximalist position of Daas Torah. I&#8217;m not saying this is wrong or intentional, rather it is a pattern and it happens.</p>
<p>My third point for this review is the nature of the relationship between Jewish scholars and their Christian and Muslim counterparts. It seems that there was much interaction between them and they worked together, at least for the sake of exorcism. It was nice to see cooperation instead of the stereotypical debates and polemics against one another. If they could do it, so could we.</p>
<p>If you have ANY interest in dybbuks or demons or exorcism or 16th century mysticism, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a>.</p>

<p>I have read all these books. I wholeheartedly recommend them. I have not done full reviews of most of these books on the blog but I have included a brief description and the rationalist significance of each of these books. I hope that if you have other books to recommend you will leave your suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>The list:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4888"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583303693/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1583303693">Masterplan: Judaism&#8211;Its Program, Meaning &amp; Goals</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Carmell, this book is based on R&#8217; Hirsch&#8217;s Horeb. It gives a framework for understanding the structure of Judaism and its commandments. It does so without using a single passage from the mystical sources. It is excellent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/190411329X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=190411329X">Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation with Mysticism</a> &#8211; Written by Menachem Kellner, this book (without saying so) debunks a common claim made by contemporary orthodox Jews. The claim is that the Rambam would have been a mysticist if only he had received the Kabbalistic Tradition. This book shows that the Rambam specifically set out to forge a rationalist path of Judaism.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00876HOFI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00876HOFI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Hashgachah Pratis: An Exploration of Divine Providence</a> - Written by Rabbi Aryeh Leibowitz, this book studies the various approaches to Hashgacha Pratis. There is a maximalist view that is prevalent in orthodox Judaism today. The rationalist is more likely to find meaning in the more minimalist views of the rishonim as they are documented in this book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764239/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1906764239">The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides&#8217; Thirteen Principles Reappraised</a> &#8211; Written by Marc Shapiro, this book, in convincing fashion, describes the myriad of opinions on matters of faith. Most people assume the Rambam&#8217;s 13 Principles have universal acceptance among Jewish thinkers throughout the millennium. Shapiro demonstrates that things are not so simple. Every meaningful point in this book is made with a traditional, accepted orthodox Jewish source.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143150/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1933143150">The Challenge of Creation: Judaism&#8217;s Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book is a rationalist explanation of Cosmology. This is a particularly difficult area of Torah to navigate without mysticism. Rabbi Slifkin does an excellent job in this book. All of Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s books are excellent. This is the most crucial book for rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143185/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1933143185">Sacred Monsters: Mysterious and Mythical Creatures of Scripture, Talmud and Midrash</a> &#8211; Also written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book explains the various creatures that seem too fantastical to be real. Either they were real and magical creatures exist or they were not real and magical creatures do not exist. This book takes the latter position and explains many of these passages that have troubled rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dovbear-on-the-parsha-dov-bear/1113656036?ean=9781257153367">DovBear on the Parsha</a> &#8211; Written by DovBear, I did a review of this book here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/">Book Review | DovBear on the Parsha</a>. This is a great book that opens the reader up to a world of pshat and medrash within our mesorah that does not embrace mystical interpretations. It also shows that with a little thinking and hard work, we can all contribute to Torah.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0791408027/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0791408027">In the Shadow of History</a> &#8211; Written by Chacham Jose Faur, this is book that opens one up to a Chacham Faur&#8217;s writings. I could have chosen many of his articles and books. But I believe that this is the most thought provoking of his books and articles that I have read. It is not quite an indispensable rationalist text but Chacham Faur is indispensable so I have suggested at least one of his books in this list.</p>
<p><strong>Double Bonus</strong>: Subscribe to <a title="Visarga" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visarga">Ḥ</a><a href="http://www.hakirah.org/" target="_blank">akirah</a> and read Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s blog: <a href="%20http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/">Rationalist Judaism</a></p>

<p>Brian Jacques, the author of the Redwall books, died. Redwall was like Harry Potter when I was a kid. The books told the same kinds of stories, with the same kinds of heroes, challenges and vivid storytelling. When I read Harry Potter I assumed J.K. Rowling was inspired and influenced by Redwall. I have no idea if I was right or wrong.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the books immensely and I will recommend the books to my son as soon as they become age appropriate. Shockingly enough, that will be VERY soon. Yikes! I am getting old!</p>
<p>Anyway, I highly recommend his books for readers above the age of 8 and have fond memories of reading these books myself.</p>
<p>I also want to personally thank Brian Jacques for writing these books.<span id="more-3758"></span> I really appreciate it. Luckily, Jacques wrote over 20 books so many young men and women will have the opportunity to enjoy his books for many years to come.</p>
<p>Start here: <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441005489?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0441005489">Redwall (Redwall, Book 1)</a> and then <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142302384?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0142302384">Mossflower (Redwall, Book 2)</a>. Those should get you hooked&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Jewish-Pirates.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2599" title="Jewish Pirates" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Jewish-Pirates-196x300.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="210" /></a>A little while ago I read the unfortunately mis-titled book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385513984?tag=eliyfink-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0385513984&amp;adid=08VJ6CN5645XHVXWS555&amp;">Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</a>.</p>
<p>I say unfortunately mis-titled because the book was excellent but it really was not about Jewish Pirates and certainly was not limited at all to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The book was good because it tells the story of some of the most famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converso">Converso</a> Jews following the Spanish and Porteguese Inquisition. The well footnoted text gave me a better appreciation for the 15 century Mediterranean Jews, their struggles and their success.</p>
<p>Perhaps above all, as I was reading the book I found myself with a greater appreciation for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews">Sephardi Jews</a>.<span id="more-2598"></span></p>
<p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385513984?tag=eliyfink-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0385513984&amp;adid=08VJ6CN5645XHVXWS555&amp;">Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</a> piecemeal. Every few weeks I would pick it up again and read another section. Meanwhile, in the real world, the Rubashkin saga has been dominated Jewish headlines. All the while, playing the victim card and charges of anti-Semitism in the legal system abound. The contrast of the Rubashkin campaigns and the reactions of the Conversos was striking.</p>
<p>Following decades of persecution and systematic genocide, the Jews of Spain and Portugal were forced northward. Many settled in Amsterdam. The local government tolerated the Jews but there were some blatantly anti-Jewish laws. The Jews were able to practice Judaism and in many respects they thrived there. For these refugee Jews, life was tough. It was not easy being Jewish.</p>
<p>The book follows the story of some of the Amsterdam Jews.</p>
<p>Not once, did I see a reference to &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221;. The Meditteranean Jews did not deal with their persecution by labeling it as anti-Semitism. I did not see any attempt to portray themselves as victims or the &#8220;lamb among the lions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ashkenazic Jews were also persecuted heavily. They were ousted from many countries and killed in many genocides. To cope with the hate and bloodshed, anti-Semitism was &#8220;blamed&#8221;.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. My impression of the current Sephardic Jewry landscape is very similar. I don&#8217;t recall hearing accusations of anti-Semitism when it comes to Sephardic Jews. Just last summer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Dwek">Solomon Dwek </a> was arrested on Federal charges of bank fraud. This criminal pled guilty and awaits sentencing. I did not hear a peep about any anti-Semitism in his investigation.</p>
<p>Dwek is Sephardic.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the bank fraud that Rubashkin has been charged with. I have spoke to otherwise reasonable people who are convinced the whole thing is a plot by the anti-Semitic government. They say things like &#8220;this is how it was in Germany 1935&#8243;.</p>
<p>Rubashkin is not Sephardic.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that they heritage play a role in our collective reactions.</p>
<p>On one level, it seems that Sephardic Jewry never had a culture of blaming anti-Semitism while Ashkenazik Jewry has been crying about anti-Semitism for six centuries and using the term for around 150 years. Thus, we still react differently today.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, there also exists an anto-Sephardic bias in the Ashkenazik community (see: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/06/24/somewhat-on-the-lighter-side/">Somewhat  On The Lighter Side</a>). Perhaps the Ashkenazic community does not consider anti-Jewish activity that harms Sephardic Jews &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps not. It&#8217;s just a thought.</p>
<p><em>(Either way, I recommend </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385513984?tag=eliyfink-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0385513984&amp;adid=08VJ6CN5645XHVXWS555&amp;"><em>Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</em></a><em>. It&#8217;s a fun read and I plan another post about the episode in the book that had the biggest impact on me.)</em></p>
