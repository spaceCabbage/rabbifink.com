<p><em>Jewish and Christian communities have long struggled to make religion relevant to youth and teens. One of the ways that both communities have attempted to combat the problem of disaffected youth has been to offer alternate programming for young people.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/synagogue_during_tora_reading_better_picture.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6308" title="synagogue" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/synagogue_during_tora_reading_better_picture-300x154.png" alt="" width="300" height="154" /></a>I read in the Forward that 1 million American Jews seek identity outside Shul. The purpose of this statistic is a bit lost on me. Sure, many Jews identify as Jewish through their attendance at synagogue. It&#8217;s just that I haven&#8217;t really met anyone like that. Most Jews I meet, whether they are secular, charedi, or somewhere in between consider their Shul as a part of their Jewish identity but I certainly don&#8217;t get the sense that Jewish Americans get their Jewish identity from shul.</p>
<p>But just for fun, let&#8217;s assume the study is a bombshell discovery that very profoundly alters the entire vision of American Judaism. We will assume that the point of the survey was to show that for many American Jews, the synagogue model is not working. As the article in the Forward concludes, quoting Medalon Braun of the Workmen&#8217;s Circle, there is <em>“a real need for a Jewish home for those who do not seek a congregational affiliation.”</em></p>
<p>It seems to me that there are three take-away points that one could make upon reading this discovery and one action item.<span id="more-6307"></span></p>
<p>1) Some people actually <em>do </em>get their Jewish identity from their shuls.</p>
<p>2) The assumption is that if one does not get their Jewish identity inside a synagogue their Jewish identity is in danger of being lost.</p>
<p>3) The people who don&#8217;t go to shul often cannot be categorized as endangered Jews as they are seeking Jewish identity, albeit outside the synagogue.</p>
<p>The action item is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>It seems that there are tons of Jews who want to affiliate Jewishly outside the synagogue. But in my assessment there is a very limited number of such opportunities, especially in a group setting. But institutionalizing these opportunities runs the risk of transferring the shul experience to experiences outside of shul. It is likely that part of the reason these people are looking outside the synagogue is because they are not the type of people who love institutionalized Judaism. Thus, creating institutionalized Judaism outside the shul is probably not going to help.</p>
<p>So what are we to do? How do we appeal to American Jews who specifically do not want to identify with institutionalized Judaism?</p>
<p>Judaism <em>is </em>institutional. On one foot, the best I can think of is Torah study. One can study Torah completely independently. One can study whatever one wants. One can publish their Torah thoughts on their own. In short, Torah study has always been a hallmark of Jewish identity and has served as a counterweight to the institutionalization of shul life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won&#8217;t appeal to everyone. Some people don&#8217;t enjoy studying and learning. However, it has been my experience that when taught properly, anyone can enjoy Torah study. It is possible that non-orthodox Jews think that Torah study is for rabbis and orthodox Jews. But I disagree. It&#8217;s for everyone.</p>
<p>So maybe we don&#8217;t need a new solution. Perhaps the answer is right under our Jewish noses. We are the people of the book. Are we not?</p>
<p>Now accepting additional suggestions&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Kiddush Club:</strong> (noun) <em>a slang term applied wherever an informal group of people leave a synagogue&#8217;s sanctuary during Jewish services on Shabbat (Saturday) morning to congregate, make kiddush (frequently over liquor) and socialize. Participants often leave services during the Haftorah reading or the sermon. &#8211; </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiddush_club" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuley Yanklowitz has a scathing indictment of kiddush clubs in The Jewish Week. The Orthodox Union has banned kiddush clubs from their shuls as well.</p>
<p>Citing &#8220;some studies&#8221; that indicate alcoholism as high as 10-15% for Jews in general, Rabbi Shmuley argues that kiddush clubs are a destructive force in our synagogues. It seems that in Rabbi Shmuley&#8217;s kiddush clubs, men stagger back into shul completely drunk. It seems to Rabbi Shmuley that Jewish teens abuse alcohol because of kiddush clubs. His writing describes the kiddush clubs as being &#8220;exclusive groups&#8221; in &#8220;back rooms&#8221; reminiscent of the back rooms in a Las Vegas casino or illegal high stakes poker game.</p>
<p>I have been to many kiddush clubs in many shuls. None fits the description of Rabbi Shmuley. None.<span id="more-4504"></span></p>
<p>There is no place for drunkenness in shul. It is prohibited to pray while inebriated. Men who get drunk during kiddush club have serious problems that can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t be solved by writing scathing diatribes against kiddush club or even by banning them.</p>
<p>I have previously written about the problem of insular communities denying internal problems. I agree that alcohol abuse may be one of those issues. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/07/15/social-issues-raised-by-the-recent-tragedy/">Social Issues Raised by the Recent Tragedy</a>)</p>
<p>But, I disagree that kiddush clubs must be discouraged or banned.</p>
<p>Going to shul on Shabbos is a religious <em>and</em> social experience. Many people enjoy the social aspects of communal prayer. I believe that this element of prayer within Judaism was a stroke of genius by the rabbis of the Talmud. Making a religious experience such as prayer intertwined with a social experience is a great way to balance two basic human needs.</p>
<p>Shabbos services are quite long. I don&#8217;t think they need to be shorter nor do I think anyone should feel bound to stay inside the sanctuary for the duration of the services. Further, most men come to shul not having eaten breakfast as per the halachic requirement that one not eat before morning services.</p>
<p>A kiddush club is just a more organized way of taking a few minute break from shul. I don&#8217;t think there is anything terribly wrong about that. Like anything, the kiddush club can&#8217;t cancel out the religious experience of attending shul. But to say that it automatically turns one&#8217;s Jewish education into a waste of money is unfair and unwarranted.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if a kiddush club gives people some extra motivation to come to shul, it is a classic example of &#8220;מתוך שלא לשמה בא לשמה&#8221; &#8211; the Talmudic concept of using ulterior motives to do the right thing. Similarly, if a shot of whiskey and some herring helps one enjoy the services a bit more, it is hard to see why it should be banned. When one is basically fasting until midday, a kiddush club can be a great pick-me-up during the long Shabbos services.</p>
<p>The kiddush clubs that I have participated in, were friendly, quick and pretty harmless overall. There is no reason all kiddush clubs can&#8217;t be the same as those. There may be a few horrible kiddush clubs, but if there are, the people who make them horrible are the problem, not the clubs themselves.</p>
<p>In short, in my experience, kiddush clubs are not as seedy or nefarious as Rabbi Shmuley alleges. Some clubs may be as bad as he claims. Even in those cases, it seems to me that the problem is the participants are their drinking problems as a whole, not the actual club. Teens may wish to experiment with alcohol. I know I did. Parents and community members need to be responsible for the teens in their lives. Eliminating kiddush clubs won&#8217;t translate into teens not being enticed by alcohol. Making the claim, based on &#8220;some (unnamed) studies&#8221; that Jewish alcoholism is at 10-15% has no relationship to kiddush clubs. A tiny percentage of Jews go to shul; an even smaller percentage participate in kiddush clubs. It is hard enough to see correlation, let alone causation.</p>
<p>Shul needs to be more fun, more engaging, more social, if a kiddush club contributes to these goals I can&#8217;t see why they should be completely shunned. People always need to be responsible about what they do. A hallmark of the non-Charedi world is the willingness to let people make their own choices and give them the tools to make those choices. Not to limit those choices with bans and polemics.</p>
<p>There are some actual benefits to the typical kiddush club. In my opinion, if they are done right they are worth keeping around.</p>

<p></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Here’s another post about my recent trip to Israel: (Read the previous two posts in the series here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/23/a-jerusalem-wedding/">A Jerusalem Wedding</a> and  <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/29/the-zilberman-home-a-thriving-jewish-family-in-the-arab-quarter-of-jerusalem/">The Zilberman Home: A Thriving Jewish Family in the Arab Quarter of Jerusalem</a>)</em></p>
<p>One of my favorite places in the world is the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem. The stones are soaked in history and the roads filled with Jews and non-Jews of all kinds seeking to hear what the Old City has to say.</p>
<p>A landmark of the Jewish Quarter was the Churva synagogue ruins. A majestic arch was all that remained of a beautiful synagogue in the Jewish Quarter square. That landmark has now been supplanted by a far more majestic one. The rebuilt synagogue dominates the Cardo / Square area. I was given a tour and some history that I would like to share with you.<span id="more-4064"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_4077" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 569px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110502.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4077 " title="P1110502" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110502-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="559" height="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;The Churva Synagogue&quot;</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">The original synagogue on this plot was built in the early 18th century by students of R&#8217; Yehuda HaChassid who settled in Jerusalem. In order to build the synagogue the builders borrowed a hefty sum from the local Ottoman Arabs. When they fell significantly into arrears, the lenders had the synagogue razed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For over 140 years the synagogue lay in ruin and became known as the Churva, &#8220;Destroyed&#8221;. In the late 19th century, students of the Vilna Gaon rebuilt the synagogue and it flourished again as the main synagogue for the Jews living in the Old City. It became an international symbol of Jewish pride and the center for Jewish religious life in Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the 1948 war for Independence, the synagogue was razed once again by Arabs. This time, not for a debt, rather for vengeance. After the war, the Old City remained under Arab control and the synagogue remained a pile of rubble.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 1967, Israel regained control over the area. The Churva shul was a priority and it was hoped that it would be rebuilt quickly. Ten years later, with no progress to speak of, the city built a commemorative arch to be a placeholder until the synagogue was rebuilt in earnest. This is the familiar arch that most visitors to the Old City will recall over the last 30 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, about 5 years ago, construction commenced and was recently completed. The result is a magnificent building which retains many of the same elements as the two original structures. The outside view is beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_4082" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hurva_Synagogue_1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4082 " title="Hurva Synagogue, Jerusalem - IsraÃ«l" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hurva_Synagogue_1.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="524" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From the outside</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Inside, takes it a whole new level. I felt like I was in the most beautiful shul I had ever been to. Once you get inside, the building takes on the familiar mode of many older synagogues with a main sanctuary on the ground level and balconies for women. The bima is in the middle of the sanctuary.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align: left;">
<dl id="attachment_4066" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px;">

<dd class="wp-caption-dd">View of the Bima from the front of the shul</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The artwork throughout the building is beautiful. There are paintings above the entrance as you can see above. There is stained glass all around the shul. The stone work and moldings are exquisite. But most of all, I loved the paintings in the ceiling corners.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The ark is stunning as well. It looks like there are two arks but really there is just one. How would they use the top one!?  The bottom ark is the functional ark. The Torah scrolls are stored in there. The top section is not an ark at all. It just looks nice.</p>
<div id="attachment_4073" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110507.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4073" title="P1110507" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110507-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The ark</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see, the synagogue is stunning. If you look carefully you can see the wall is made of two shades of stone. I believe, the darker stone is original stone from the ruins and the lighter stone is the new stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, greater than the physical beauty of the shul is the symbolism of the shul. Its original builders were chasidic mystics risked everything to come to Jerusalem in an attempt to hasten the coming of the Messiah. The next builders were vehement opponents of the chasidic movement. The most recent builders was the government of Israel. Now, the shul is maintained by the Zilberman family of the Old City. Four groups of Jews that may not share all that much in common. But the shul connects them all.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Isn&#8217;t that one of the points of a shul? To build community? To connect people who would otherwise be disconnected? From Judaism? Or even just from each other?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think it is. That is why I am proud to represent the Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach. Our shul also connects all sorts of people. Our shul is also a common thread among diverse people. The Churva shul is a model for us and others. I hope more shuls can take this model and implement it in their communities in the hope that we can foster unity among our people.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Taking it one step further, the Churva shul has been destroyed twice. And rebuilt twice as well. Our Temple was destroyed twice but only rebuilt (from scratch) once so far. We hope and pray that the Third Temple will be rebuilt speedily in our days.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, in our lives we too can feel destroyed sometimes. Look to the Churva shul for inspiration and hopefully we can rebuild ourselves as beautifully as the Churva shul has been rebuilt.</p>
