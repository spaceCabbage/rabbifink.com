				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s finale season on television these days. Writers try to make the finales the most compelling episodes of the season. The best stories drag us into their narratives so deeply that we feel the emotions of the characters and the lines between fiction and reality become blurred. The story may not be true or real, but the emotions the viewer experiences are very true and very real.</p>
<p>This week’s Torah portion feels like the season finale of the Joseph saga. There’s a tendency to lose focus of the Biblical narrative and forget to experience the story. I make sure to tune in to the Joseph epic every year. It&#8217;s my favorite story in the Bible, and the season finale never fails to emotionally engage me. Joseph’s ancient drama of intrigue, fratricide, conspiracy, love, revenge, forgiveness, and reconciliation has been enthralling us for millennia but it has always been an old story about Joseph and his brothers. I can relate to elements of the story, like any other good story, but it’s always been in terms of “Joseph the person who lived in ancient Canaan with a starring role in a very old tale.”<span id="more-9065"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9068" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/untitled-188-of-272.jpeg?fit=600%2C600" alt="untitled (188 of 272)" data-recalc-dims="1" />I think there is a great need for Modern Midrash. Our old Midrashic literature is rich and full of beautiful insights from a world very different than our own. All good Midrash channels the struggles of the Zeitgeist through the lens of the Bible. Modernity has its own unique challenges that demand our attention, and we should scour the Bible for new interpretations and ideas that speak to our contemporary battles.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of Modern Midrash is Eli Schwebel’s heartfelt Ani Yosef from his Hearts Mind album. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/25/music-review-hearts-mind/" target="_blank">Hearts Mind represents a necessary evolution in the Orthodox Jewish music genre</a>. The last few decades have seen almost no musical innovation and have taken a step backwards lyrically. Ani Yosef and the rest of the album reverse that trend. The exquisite music and lyrics do not sound familiar at all in style or substance. In my mind, that is reason enough to celebrate this musical treasure.</p>
<p>More profoundly, Ani Yosef captures the tension of modern religious struggles spectacularly. It zooms out of the dramatic one-time encounter between Joseph and his brothers, turning his personal struggle into a powerful archetype of a spiritual warrior wrestling with faith and experience. We hear something original in this reinterpretation of the story. It speaks to us in a new way.</p>
<p>I discussed this modern spiritual tension with Eli. He said,<em>“Ani Yosef is my attempt at reconciling my struggle with God, my personal emotional and intellectual walls, my rich Jewish heritage, tradition, and culture, and my unfolding consciousness.”</em> The song was written at a time in Eli’s life where the tension of <em>“trying to fuse a deep sense and knowledge of oneness with the education of a very specific way to connect with God”</em> felt overwhelming. The raw emotion of that moment in Eli’s life is the soul of Ani Yosef.</p>
<p>Today, Finkorswim.com proudly presents the exclusive debut of the Ani Yosef Lyric Video. Behind the bold-faced text in the video, a story is told. This is an almost perfect metaphor for all Midrash. The text is in the foreground, but the interpretation is happening in the background. This video tells a new interpretation of the Joseph story. It’s a Midrash Inception, and in a subtle way, it makes the song’s message even more profound.</p>
<p>I asked Eli about this new artistic Midrash that combines music with Torah, and modern life. Eli grew up singing in the home of a famous singer and is the grandson of a Chazan, which gave him an intense love for music. Their music was most often expressing the sentiment of someone outside the self. <em>“You take a verse, add a tune, and voila, there is a connection. This is the first level, the lowest and the safest.”</em> There is a second level too. It is original. It tells the story of a hero outside the self. The singer steps into the shoes of the hero, almost voyeuristically. <em>“Shloima Carlebach is a great example of utilizing stories and verses as an escape from his deep inner brokenness. But he never explicitly expressed his true self. He never let go and shared his broken heart and shattered soul.”</em> There is yet a third level, when the music becomes a true expression of self. This is what we are missing. It is the place where the inner anguish and torment is displayed with complete candor and confidence. <em>“Where is the Orthodox Jewish Johnny Cash? Who is utilizing Jewish tradition, its symbols, or its Torah to say something intimate?”</em></p>
<p>It has become unfashionable in the Orthodox Jewish community to honestly acknowledge religious struggles. Instead, we’ve created a false binary choice. One is either in or out, seemingly arbitrarily. Challenges and personal struggles are not seriously addressed. Ani Yosef hits this tension in the bulls-eye.</p>
<p>Eli was very candid about this problem.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“The reason the frum world is so scared of this expression is because it speaks to what is perceived as the greatest threat to Orthodox Judaism: doubt. Any sort of doubt is considered blasphemous. The mantra is ’never doubt.’ Meaning, you may not doubt. True art and personal expression can focus and connect the entirety of the human experience, including doubt and darkness, to something beyond our personal experience. But specifically there must be a &#8216;from&#8217; to go toward. If we negate and minimize the from, we lose authentic context. If we negate and minimize our truest, deepest thoughts and feelings, we lose the ability to channel or transcend those feelings. We may feel good at a</em> kumzitz,<em> we may dance, but the artist that awakens something deeper toward something higher, is one that is completely whole with their demons and their power when they express their soul artistically. In the eternal words of the great Bob Dylan, ‘Chaos is a friend of mine.’”</em></p>
<p>Indeed, chaos should be a friend of ours. As a society, we&#8217;ve decided that chaos is our enemy. Joseph&#8217;s life was a life of chaos. Beauty and spiritual growth emerge from chaos; we just have to embrace it.</p>
<p>I asked Eli about his inspiration for the song and the video.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Towards the end of his life, my grandfather Joseph Wassner (another Yosef) and I developed a deep bond as we talked about our ideas and our struggles. This song layers the life of Biblical Yosef, imagining what he must have been going through yearning for his fathers love, dealing with the anger towards his brothers, having to deal with his identity shifting as he takes on an entirely new culture, and his ability to still hold on to the core values by which he was raised. That is exactly what I am trying to do as I discover my place in this world, as my grandfather did, as we all do. The story of Yosef is all of our stories!”</em></p>
<p>I agree. We all need to find Yosef in ourselves. We tend to see the forefathers as larger-than-life figures, and it can be impossible to relate to them. They <em>should</em> be viewed as archetypes of our struggles. We are selling ourselves short by idealizing the Bible heroes, because we lose the ability to connect to them in a meaningful way, which is the whole point. Find yourself in the stories. Find yourself in the Joseph story. You’ll discover that it is really true for you: <em>Ani Yosef</em> &#8211; I am Joseph.</p>

<p>We bared our souls and left our emotions on our sleeve throughout the last few weeks. But now it&#8217;s over. There is a void where our worry and concern occupied our hearts. It begs to be filled.</p>
<p>Music can help us heal, or at least help us cope. The tune that has been working for me is one of my favorite Jewish songs, Umacha by The Rabbis&#8217; Sons. It was therapeutic for me to make this little video with some of the poignant images set to Umacha. It helped me a little so I am sharing it with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Israel, a haredi woman named Ruth Colian is asking that the Israeli government stop funding haredi political parties because they discriminate against women. The haredi parties will not place a woman on their ballots, yet they are receiving money from the government. Colian argues that the government is sponsoring gender discrimination by supporting the patriarchal system of haredi Judaism in politics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good argument and I hope she wins. But that&#8217;s not the issue here.<span id="more-7733"></span></p>
<p>The real issue is that Colian is running as a haredi woman for political office. She won&#8217;t run on a secular list because she says she is haredi. She wants to break the glass ceiling in the haredi community. I wish her luck because it won&#8217;t be easy. In the past, people who tried to change haredi norms were either pushed out or left on their own accord. It&#8217;s an uncomfortable place to be a revolutionary but maybe Colian will be the one.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7735" alt="feminism2" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/feminism2.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If she is successful, it will mean yet another avenue that haredi women can achieve the same level of acclaim and success as men. Leaving the rabbinate as one of the few places haredi women cannot. That might prove to be a difficult position to maintain.</p>
<p>Corian is a true haredi feminist. She is haredi and she is vying for equal opportunities for women. This is the basic premise of feminism. It comes in many flavors and textures, but at the heart of all of these feminist movements is a sense that men and women should have equal opportunities and that men should not dictate the role that women must play in society. One can see how feminism and haredi life seem incompatible. While it&#8217;s true that many, if not most, haredi women choose to play the dignified and refined role of mother, wife, and homemaker on the sidelines of religious and communal life, there are many women who would prefer to have a choice to play a more public role in religious and communal life. That is what the haredi feminists want.</p>
<p>When juxtaposed with a trailer for an upcoming documentary on the hasidic community of Brooklyn called Uniforms: The Hasidic #Community, Corian&#8217;s struggle seems even more poignant. The documentary was produced by a self proclaimed non-traditional Jewish woman. She offers a peek into the softer, more spiritual side of Hasidic Judaism. It&#8217;s a noble attempt to show good people living good lives. The public has a negative perception of Hasidic Judaism and this documentary could go a long way to bridging that divide.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the extremely problematic conflation of different hasidic groups in the movie, illustrated by the visuals of chasidim in shtreimels and double head coverings for the women, while hip Chabad people talk about their more liberal way of life, there was a line in the trailer that requires attention.</p>
<p>A woman, who almost certainly is Chabad as betrayed by her perfectly unaccented English, proclaims: <em>&#8220;Jewish [sic] women, we&#8217;re kind of the biggest feminist women out there. Judaism creates space for women to tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think that if a woman wants to &#8220;tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children&#8221; she should have that opportunity. I am all for traditional values for women that want those values in their lives. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s one of the secrets to Orthodox Judaism. In fact, I think it&#8217;s a problem that so many husbands and fathers are studying all day while their wives are leaving the home to support their husbands and babies are being dropped off at day care. I believe the traditional home is a great ideal and bearing children is a wonderful and powerful role to play in this world.</p>
<p>However, it is decidedly not feminist. It can be feminist to choose that life. But if everyone is doing it, or is expected to do it, it does not fit any accepted meaning of the word. You can&#8217;t unilaterally change the entire meaning of the word feminist and apply it to haredi Judaism. It doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test, forget the smell test.</p>
<p>And why is feminism an ideal for this haredi woman? Why is she trying to pretend that a world where women are not given every opportunity that men are given and they are expected to produce large families is feminist. It&#8217;s not feminist at all. Proudly so! Recently, I heard a prominent rabbi say that Jewish feminists were comparable to reform and conservative Judaism! Orthodox Judaism is not feminist. You need to be okay with that to be orthodox.</p>
<p>In Israel, Ruth Corian is dying for the opportunity to lead her community. She is a feminist. In Brooklyn the party line is apparently that being a mom is the most feminist thing one can do.</p>
<p>Again, I am not degrading moms. God forbid! I think it&#8217;s a great choice if one can and one wants to make it. But it&#8217;s not feminist if that is what is expected. But even more perplexing is why are you trying to call it feminist?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is an isolated incident. I&#8217;ve seen this more and more often. People are selling Orthodox Judaism as feminist. I&#8217;m a pretty liberal Orthodox Jew and I don&#8217;t see how anyone could interpret my religion as feminist.</p>
<p>Personally, it bothers me. I grapple with it. I struggle with the current inequality and I empathize with those orthodox Jewish women who want to play a more prominent public role. I wish Orthodox Judaism had more feminist opportunities. I do my best to accommodate feminism within tradition. But I don&#8217;t redefine the term to conform to my orthodox worldview. Words have meaning and that meaning must be respected.</p>
<p>It seems impossible, if not extremely unlikely, that orthodox Judaism will ever have equal opportunities for men and women. Maybe that&#8217;s okay. Not every religion or creed has to conform with every modern sensibility. But let&#8217;s at least be honest about it. And if we can, try to break as many glass ceilings that we can shatter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my most precious memories are the many years we sat in our family Sukkah with my grandparents as our guests. My grandmother still joins my parents for Sukkos sometimes. But my grandfather passed away almost 11 years ago ,yet his presence in my life is constant.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible for me to think about Sukkos without thinking of my grandfather singing &#8220;A Sukkeleh.&#8221; Even as I type these words I feel a swell of emotion and tears invade my eyes. It meant that much to us. I might not have appreciated it enough as a child, but I do now.<span id="more-7640"></span></p>
<p>With some Internet elbow grease I was able to get a digital copy of the song and after a couple of hours of work I put this video together. It might be nothing special or have little meaning to you but the song means a lot to me. My grandfather would have loved this. I don&#8217;t understand Yiddish so I had to find a translation of the words online. I used R&#8217; Shafran&#8217;s version as seen on <a href="http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/stillstands.html" target="_blank">Torah.org</a>  (see his article too) with a couple of tiny adjustments:<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7642" alt="tri_55474_1999-92" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tri_55474_1999-92.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A sukkaleh, so small<br />
Wooden planks for each wall<br />
Lovingly I stood them upright<br />
I laid thatch as a ceiling<br />
And now, filled with deep feeling<br />
I sit in my sukkaleh at night.</p>
<p>A cold wind attacks,<br />
Blowing through the cracks<br />
The candles, they flicker and yearn<br />
It&#8217;s so strange a thing<br />
That as the Kiddush I sing<br />
The flames, calmed, now quietly burn.</p>
<p>In comes my daughter<br />
Bearing hot food and water<br />
Worry on her face like a pall<br />
She just stands there shaking<br />
And her voice nearly breaking<br />
Says &#8220;Tattenyu, the sukkah&#8217;s going to fall!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear daughter, don&#8217;t fret<br />
It hasn&#8217;t fallen yet<br />
The sukkah&#8217;s fine, banish your fright<br />
There have been many such fears<br />
For nigh two thousand years<br />
Yet the sukkeleh&#8217;s still standing upright.</p>

It may seem like your average AL East battle between two up and coming teams, or it could just be a symbolic contest between the two cities with Ner Israel yeshivas, Ner Israel Baltimore and Ner Israel Toronto. (No relation)</p>
<p>One bochur attended the game and I doubt he expected he would be caught on camera during the game. Surely he did not think he would be one of the stars of ESPN SportsCenter.</p>
<p>I hope he wasn&#8217;t skipping <em>seder.</em></p>
<p>Colby Rasmus hit a ball deep into foul territory just foul of left field. Nate McLouth made a spectacular attempt to catch the ball diving into the stands mere inches from our baseball loving yeshiva bochur. It wasn&#8217;t absolutely clear whether the ball was caught. The bochur attempted to clarify matters for the umpire by signaling that it was no catch. In one SportsCenter broadcast, fellow member of the tribe Steve Levy was narrating the highlight and he said something about how &#8220;you got to trust the kid in the cap&#8221; (referring to the bochur&#8217;s yarmulka). The umpire would have none of it and called the batter out.</p>
<p>Clearly the bochur is a Blue Jays fan and he got caught up in the moment. He must have thought he saw the ball pop out of McLouth&#8217;s glove. I&#8217;d hate to think he got caught lying intentionally on national television.</p>
<p><em><strong>EDIT</strong>: The bochur is sticking to his story in the comments below. He says the ball popped out. However, even if the ball did pop out it was a catch before McLouth crashed over the wall. So the umpire made the correct call.</em></p>
<p>The amazing catch finished the night as the SportsCenter Top Play of the night. The catch and the bochur were shown on TV dozens of times. The bochur is famous!<span id="more-7117"></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, the bochur had no part in the beer throwing incident moments later that resulted in the ejection of the guilty fan in the same vicinity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7081" alt="91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=230%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Over the weekend it was reported that a teacher in an orthodox Jewish school in Seattle has been charged with molesting two six year old girls in his class. It is suspected that this fellow molested more than just the two girls but he is only charged with molesting the two girls.</p>
<p>Sex abuse happens everywhere. It is no indictment of a school, community, or family if sex abuse occurs. The test is how sex abuse is dealt with. The most important question is whether the victim is able to articulate that they have been abused and that the victim has a safe place to talk about the abuse. If no one comes forward there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>It takes great courage to come forward. But more importantly, it takes education to come forward. Our best defense against abuse is quite simply our children. If they are equipped with the tools necessary to prevent molestation and report it when it happens we have our first two lines of defense in place.</p>
<p>The prosecutor in the case in Seattle attributes the girls&#8217; willingness to come forward and their ability to articulate what happened to a book that is the brainchild of Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, written by Bracha Goetz and illustrated by Tova Leff. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a>. Incredibly, it took years for this book to see the light of day. But now it is endorsed by leading Torah authorities and it must be in every home and every school.</p>
<p><span id="more-7080"></span></p>
<p>In a sensitive way, the book gives children the tools to prevent abuse. When the book was released, I bought several copies of the book for my home and anywhere else I thought it necessary.</p>
<p>Just consider for a moment how incredible it is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> helped end a cycle of abuse in Seattle. It could do the same in your community. Get the book.</p>
<p>In places where abuse is not reported and not even acknowledged there is too much space for predators to wreak havoc. It is a matter of <em>sakanas nefashos, </em>we must act now. Our children must be educated. There are no excuses. We must educate our most insular communities on the harms of abuse and help them help themselves get out from under the cycle of abuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> is so versatile that it is not only a book that prevents abuse. The book also keeps children safe generally. Rabbi Horowitz shared with me a letter that he received from a learning disabled child thanking him for the book as it helped him in several situations. The letter is so sweet and innocent, it brought tears to my eyes. It is time for us to take this challenge and grab it by the horns. The first step is buying and using this book.</p>
<p>Aside from the book, Rabbi Horowitz has an excellent video on keeping our children safe. Watch that here: <a href="http://youtu.be/LWQHaInsCGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6987" alt="bill-maher" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bill-maher.jpg?resize=250%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" />A lot of people are very excited that uber-liberal Bill Maher has nasty things to say about Islam. Maher&#8217;s premise is that Islam is the <em>most</em> violent religion today by far and therefore it is unreasonable to raise the argument that religious extremism exists in other religions.</p>
<p>The joke Maher uses to make his point is that he wonders (and this is not his joke) if there could be a &#8220;Book of Islam&#8221; on Broadway like there is a Book of Mormon on Broadway. Maher is correct that a Book of Islam show would probably incite people.</p>
<p>To make this argument work the parameters must be equal. In fact, a plain reading of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/22/a-secular-explanation-for-terrorism/" target="_blank">my post from yesterday </a>is a direct rebuttal of Maher&#8217;s point. If there were 1.6 billion or 2.2 billion (whatever the actual numbers are) Mormons living in developing countries, under oppressive regimes, with poor education, and little chance for freedom or financial success, I am fairly certain that you would have violent, Jihad-like Mormons.<span id="more-6986"></span></p>
<p>The same goes for Jews, Christians, or whomever. People living under those conditions will have a greater propensity towards violence and anti-social behavior. It spans all religions, creeds, and time.</p>
<p>We have senseless systematic violence all over the world. It usually comes back to these same factors.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the point here. There are more dispositive factors in deciphering why certain people turn to violence and others do not. Ignoring factors that are universal and pointing to factors that are theological and specific to one group is a fair argument, but it&#8217;s not the only argument and probably not the best argument.</p>
<p>Why did Christians go on Crusades every few years a few centuries ago? For the same reasons. And so when we say &#8220;look at Christian violence from history&#8221; we are not saying that Christianity is <em>also </em>a &#8220;violent religion&#8221; we are saying that the factors that made Christianity seem violent throughout history are the same factors that make Islam seem violent today. But eliminating those factors is the best way to fix the problem not blaming religion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Maher&#8217;s cute joke is a red herring and that&#8217;s why I still maintain my position that there are much more fundamental factors that create an environment conducive to senseless violence than a book.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Bill Maher dismissing a Professor of Hate and Extremism:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/angus_t_jones_blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6546" title="angus_t_jones_blog" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/angus_t_jones_blog.jpg?resize=195%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>There is a very lowbrow television show called Two and Half Men. It used to star Charlie Sheen, but he went off the reservation. Ashton Kutsher took over for Sheen. But the other two stars have been there since the start. Believe it or not, despite capitalizing on bathroom humor, objectification of women, and recycling its own jokes, Two and Half Men is the #1 comedy on TV every year and it makes zillions of dollars. (What does that say about American culture?)</p>
<p>The stars of the show make upwards of $350,000 per 30 minute episode. Angus T. Jones is the actor who plays the youngest member of the household. He is a very, very wealthy young man.</p>
<p>Recently he has been doing some soul searching. Apparently making millions did not satisfy Mr. Jones, he needed some spirituality in his life. So he joined a black Mega Church in Atlanta that is Seventh Day Adventist (my favorite kind of Christians), where a man named The Forerunner preaches about the ills of today&#8217;s society. The Forerunner did a two part video of Angus T. Jones&#8217; Testimony. This is Mega-Church-Speak for one&#8217;s story of how they found Jesus.</p>
<p>If you want to hear Angus&#8217;s story click the YouTube link at the bottom of the post. Fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>But there is one quote in there that has become newsworthy.<span id="more-6545"></span> Angus says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;If you watch &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217;, please stop watching &#8216;Two and a Half Men,&#8217; I&#8217;m on &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217; and I don&#8217;t want to be on it. If I am doing any harm, I don&#8217;t want to be here. I don&#8217;t want to be contributing to the enemy&#8217;s plan&#8230; You cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like that. I&#8217;m not okay with what I&#8217;m learning, what the Bible says and being on that television show.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Now this set off a bit of a firestorm. Angus has since apologized and all seems okay at this point.</p>
<p>The question I have is whether Angus should be working on a show that he feels goes against his morals. If he feels that it is such a disgraceful show, how can he not be a hypocrite if he still acts on the show?</p>
<p>Perhaps the fact that he is under contract makes fulfilling the terms of his obligation the morally correct thing to do. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>It just seems so disingenuous to talk about not wanting to be on the show and then being on the show. No one is forcing him. He should have the strength to act upon his convictions. If it&#8217;s really so bad (and apparently it is) he should put his money where his mouth is, and quit.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&#8217;s just a lot talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ObamaSilvermanAd_6721738.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6330" title="ObamaSilvermanAd_6721738" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ObamaSilvermanAd_6721738.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>As far as I know, Rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt is a lovely fellow. Unfortunately, he ran into some trouble over the last few days. <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/dear-sarah-silverman/2012/10/11/0/" target="_blank">After he published an open letter to Sarah Silverman in the Jewish Press</a>, and Sarah&#8217;s father responded quite forcefully in the comments, Jezebel found the whole thing more than a bit entertaining and made Rabbi Rosenblatt look like a moron.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Sarah Silverman is a Jewish comic. She is crude, not really that funny in my opinion, and only mildly entertaining when she is not trying to be too shocking. She did a little YouTube video telling black, Latino, old, and young people to make sure they register to vote. The title of the video is &#8220;Let my people vote&#8221;. The video is crude and as per usual full of colorful language. But the message is completely innocuous. Her message is to register to vote, or at least to get a firearm license. I think we all agree that registering to vote is a message we can all get behind.</p>
<p>Rabbi Rosenblatt takes offense to Sarah Silverman&#8217;s very existence it seems, but his excuse for writing his &#8220;open letter&#8221; to her is because the title of her video was &#8220;framed in biblical language&#8221;. For the life of me, I cannot comprehend how using a phrase that is based on a loosely translated verse from the bible is sufficient cause to rant against someone, but apparently it works for Rabbi Rosenblatt.</p>
<p>The rant speaks for itself. It is an anti-feminist, pro-baby making diatribe. I am not going to comment further on the appropriateness of his comment that Sarah Silverman should just have some babies already and stop worrying about politics. You can read it and the comments for yourself.<span id="more-6329"></span></p>
<p>All the publicity surrounding this letter is definitely not good PR for Jews and certainly a stain on the already suffering public reputation of orthodox Jews. Even if Sarah Silverman would have read the letter and decided that Rabbi Rosenblatt was correct in everything he said, it seems dubious to assume that this letter would be a <em>kiddush Hashem </em>of some sort. That&#8217;s another discussion as well.</p>
<p>What I do want to discuss is the theological underpinning of Rabbi Rosenblatt&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>The first theological statement is this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>You have made a career making public that which is private, making crude that which is intimate, making sensual that which is spiritual. You have experienced what traditional Judaism taught long ago: when you make sex a public thing it loses its potency. When the whisper is replaced with a shout there is no magic to speak about. And, in my opinion, Sarah, that is why you have had trouble forging a permanent relationship – the most basic desire of the feminine soul.</em></p>
<p>Both men and women have a basic desire to forge deep relationships. I am not sure if either men or women want to forge a permanent relationship so badly that it could be called the most basic desire. But more importantly, I know of no reason to connect one&#8217;s willingness to keep intimacy private with one&#8217;s ability to create a relationship. But most importantly, Sarah Silverman has had some pretty long term relationships in her life already. Kudos to her. Just because she hasn&#8217;t tied the knot doesn&#8217;t mean she can&#8217;t attempt to make a permanent relationship. Dating is not permanent. Relationships are not permanent. Marriage is not permanent either.</p>
<p>Then this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As an Orthodox rabbi, I disagree with just about everything you say, but respect your right to say it. All I ask, respectfully, is that you not use traditional Jewish terminology in your efforts. Because doing so is a lie.</em></p>
<p>The issue at stake here is whether one should register to vote. I am unsure why Rabbi Rosenblatt would disagree with this. As I said earlier, I see no reason Sarah Silverman should refrain from using traditional Jewish terminology. It&#8217;s not offensive to use &#8220;Let my people vote&#8221; as a take off on &#8220;Let my people go.&#8221; I don&#8217;t see how it can be. It certainly is not a lie.</p>
<p>And finally this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Marriage and children will change the way you see the world. It will allow you to appreciate the stability that Judaism, the religion of your ancestors, espouses. And it will allow you to understand and appreciate the traditional lifestyle’s peace, security, and respect for human dignity&#8230;</em></p>
<p> Marriage and children definitely change the way one sees the world. But I find it offensive to presume that only a married parent can find their way in Judaism. Anyone can appreciate Judaism. You don&#8217;t need to be married and a parent. God does not even require women to get married or have children in the Torah. Why does Rabbi Rosenblatt?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE </strong>(thanks to Rabbi Bronstein in the comments for helping me to see this): One more thing. It speaks to a grave misapprehension regarding mental illness and motherhood to suggest that a depressed woman have children to cure her depression. Is Rabbi Rosenblatt taking responsibility for the welfare of Sarah Silverman&#8217;s children? Depression is real. And there is an archaic attitude toward depression in the frum community that somehow thinks that having children is the cure for everything from marital issues to depression. Not good.</p>
<p>Personally, I think a public apology and retraction is in order. I see no justification for the letter nor do I see any justification for the theology behind the letter. I hope Rabbi Rosenblatt does the right thing. Hopefully it can begin to heal the wounds created by his open letter.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warning: There is plenty of strong adult language in the comments on the Jewish Press site and only more on Jezebel and even more yet in the video in question.</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6262" title="sacks" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks.jpg?resize=300%2C187" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I deeply admire Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks. It is with great interest that I watched his BBC Television program on Science vs. Religion. I really enjoyed it, but found it a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>The premise is that Rabbi Sacks is on a mission to open dialogue with premier British scientists. The production value is high and it is an enjoyable program. (Although I can&#8217;t for the life of me understand why the YouTube video is not in HD and appears squished.) The show is from his perspective. This means that it edited and cut to his liking. This is fine, but it severely limits the objectivity of the show.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch intelligent people talking about important things, but clearly the content is dumbed down for a broad audience.<span id="more-6261"></span></p>
<p>The best segment is the Richard Dawkins segment. Rabbi Sacks challenges Dawkins and Dawkins challenges the Rabbi. Neither of them really answer each other&#8217;s questions. It&#8217;s a little frustrating to the viewer who actually wants to see highly intelligent people debate.</p>
<p>But the value in this video lies not only in the actual questions and answers, its value lies in the acknowledgement that there are questions that science cannot answer and that there are questions that religion cannot answer.</p>
<p>The one thing that bothered me in watching this video how many times scientists challenged Rabbi Sacks about the &#8220;truth&#8221; of Torah and religion and Rabbi Sacks did not answer them with a clear response. I don&#8217;t know if he has a clear response, but there was none in the video.</p>
<p>But there was much to like.</p>
<p>I like how Dawkins differentiates between Darwinism to explain our existence and his refusal to use Social Darwinism to create society. I loved how Rabbi Sacks pounces on this as a way of showing that bad science can be just as damaging as bad religion. Then Rabbi Sacks uses Dawkins&#8217; response to this to show that there is common ground between Religion and Science in that we all share certain values and in those areas we should work together to ensure those mutual goals are met and not foiled by bad religion or bad science. Dawkins is even willing to work together toward common goals.</p>
<p>How many times have I said the same kind of thing with regard to atheism, other religions, secular Judaism, progressive religious Judaism and traditional religious Judaism? I agree with this vehemently. There are many problems that plague us all. Many of the solutions to those problems can be found in religion and science.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sacks ends the program with a soliloquy on the &#8220;power of the conversation&#8221;. This is my mantra as well. The Internet is a place to have that conversation but it must carry over to world of human interaction. We need to enable this kind of conversation as much as we possibly can.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that we need to have the same conversation about science and religion. I mean that we need to have conversations between all of humankind on matters upon which we agree. Those areas are so broad and vast and in those areas we can all contribute. The secular world has much to learn from religion and its values. Religion has much to gain from science. Let&#8217;s not allow our differences to get in the way of progress for mankind.</p>
<p>As we begin a new Jewish year, let us commit to opening dialogue between all people of faiths and creeds for a better tomorrow.</p>

The national media has picked up the most important story in the orthodox Jewish community of our day. Nothing compares to this. Not Internet bans or Siyum celebrations or kosher hot dogs. This is THE issue of our time.</p>
<p>CNN does a superficial but somewhat thorough and honest segment on abuse in the chasidic community.</p>
<p>I have embedded the report below. You can watch it, share it, and cry for the victims.</p>
<p>I will just make several bullet points:<span id="more-5737"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The segment is not sensationalist or riddled with half-truths. It is honest and straightforward.</li>
<li>Denial is a powerful drug.</li>
<li>I honestly believe that Hynes is not &#8220;protecting abusers&#8221; for the sake of votes. I think he can&#8217;t prosecute without witnesses and he needs cooperation from victims to prosecute. (I wrote about that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</li>
<li>One in five being abused is a number that is not scientific but is very possible. One in five thousand would be enough to push us to deal with the issue. One in five is a number that demands immediate and powerful action.</li>
<li>The intimidation of victims and their families should warrant its own segment. Protecting abusers and sacrificing victims is not just heartless and stupid, it compounds the effects of abuse by giving victims the right to think that they are sacrifices and I believe can be linked to victim suicide.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s obviously not just in the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish communities that abuse occurs, but the approach to dealing with abuse is the main difference between the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish community and the rest of the world. We are not equipped to deal with it internally even if we admit that we have a problem. How could we be?</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5680" title="good-job-blue-ribbon" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon.png?resize=217%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>After the Celtics defeated the Heat in Game 5 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals in what will surely be remembered as a disastrous game for LeBron, Wade, and company something managed to distract the public from the actual game. As Shane Battier and Ronny Turiaf exited the court through the tunnel the very loud, high pitched voice of a child pierced through the depressing noise of the arena.</p>
<p>While millions of people were watching the dejected Heat hang their heads in shame, one young fan&#8217;s voice pierced through the airwaves with an inspirational message. &#8220;Good job!&#8221; Good effort!&#8221; he cried. His team had just suffered a horrible loss, he must have been in pain, but he rose above it all to give his favorite players a bit of hope and positive reinforcement as they left the court.<span id="more-5678"></span></p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s name is Jack Meyer and he 9 years old. He has been a fan of the Heat since he was 3 or 4 years old and he must have been really upset after that loss. But he probably plays sports in a league and when his team loses or is getting outplayed his coaches probably shout out the same refrain. &#8220;Good job! Good effort!&#8221; I bet it lifts his spirits when he hears it and he just wanted to share the same inspiration to his favorite athletes.</p>
<p>The story is touching and absolutely adorable. You have to admire this kid&#8217;s positivity and his good job and good effort in inspiring his team.</p>
<p>Postivity is so important. We can accomplish so much when we feel good and when we feel like we are doing well. To be sure, pain and suffering can be excellent sources of inspiration as well. Perhaps necessity and anguish are even more effective motivators. But for the majority of us whose lives are not overloaded with pain and suffering, positive reinforcement is a great motivator and a great way to keep us from falling into melancholy or apathy.</p>
<p>But the truth is that sometimes a good job or a good effort is simply not enough. It could be argued that the Heat did not do a good a job and did not give their best effort. But let&#8217;s grant them a good effort and a good job for a moment. They still lost the game! And the game matters. Their job was to win. Their job was to give effort and do a good job but more than that, their goal was to win.</p>
<p>In life, effort matters. But results matter more. Effort matters. But achieving your goals matters more.</p>
<p>I am not trying to be a Grinch. I have a point. I think that we all have passions and responsibilities in our lives. And sometimes we neglect them. But we pat ourselves on the back and say &#8220;Good job! Good Effort! and think that is enough. It&#8217;s a start. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>If we want to learn more Torah, give more charity, spend more time with our spouses and children, do more acts of lovingkindness, make a difference in our communities, we can&#8217;t be satisfied with good effort. We need to demand from ourselves action and results. We all want to do more than we are doing. We can each apply this to various areas of our lives.</p>
<p>Much of the talk on the Internet is effort and sometimes it&#8217;s a good job. But if we don&#8217;t actually accomplish anything, we are not maximizing our opportunities. So many great ideas and conversations happen on the blogs and Facebook and Twitter (notice I left out Google Plus&#8230;), we need to somehow channel all of that into actual change.</p>
<p>It can be done. It must be done. Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p>Your inspiration:</p>

It&#8217;s too dangerous. He speaks his mind, is willing to challenge people, and he is very respected and beloved by the orthodox Jewish community.</p>
<p>Apparently, something got in the head of the Agudah Convention powers that be and they invited him to speak about the challenges some of our youth are going through in their lives. He speaks from experience, excellent instinct, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Two things to note:</p>
<p>Random clapping at the wrong times is cringeworthy but sadly humorous. You&#8217;ll notice what I am talking about.</p>
<p>The people who needed to hear this speech more than anybody else were not present. When the speech ends you can see the dais is empty. The rabbis in leadership positions needed to hear this speech more than anyone else. Maybe you can send then the youtube clip to watch on their shmutz phones.</p>
<p>Enjoy the speech. There is so much in there and almost all of it is right on the money. Please send this to as many people as you can:<span id="more-5445"></span></p>

<p>I have no idea if the curriculum is good or bad, useful or useless. Anything that can be done should and must be done.</p>
<p>Bullying is happening all over the world and the orthodox Jewish schools are not immune. I know of modern orthodox schools that have developed their own programs and they work. But there is a reputation in the more yeshivish schools that there is bullying and violence. I have seen it first hand.</p>
<p>FIX IT. NOW.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Kony-2012-Celebrity-Support.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5268" title="Kony-2012-Celebrity-Support" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Kony-2012-Celebrity-Support.jpg?resize=300%2C187" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>As of this moment the Kony 2012 video has over 74 million hits on YouTube. The video has been a smashing viral video success. Everyone knows more about Kony today than they knew a few weeks ago. (Don&#8217;t know what I am talking about? Watch the video on <a href="http://youtu.be/Y4MnpzG5Sqc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.)</p>
<p>The quality of the production is excellent. It draws you into the narrative cleverly and is very persuasive. But the video and the parent organization that produced the video, Invisible Children have also drawn criticism. All in all, the phenomena is fascinating and I think there are some lessons that are worth mentioning.<span id="more-5266"></span></p>
<p>&gt; Social media is THE media for people born in the 80&#8217;s and beyond. In other words, people 30 and under get their information and news from Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and YouTube (and maybe The Daily Show). They do not get their news from the Nightly News or the 24/7 news cycle. Obviously, there are exceptions. But I think this campaign shows that a compelling story that has been in and out of the network news for years is a new story for the under 30 crowd. This is quite simply because most of them don&#8217;t watch the networks.</p>
<p>&gt; Hits are not the same as donations, but hits can <em>turn into</em> donations. <a href="http://jezebel.com/5891878/kony-2012-director-says-its-not-about-money-while-campaign-makes-millions" target="_blank">It seems that the Kony 2012 campaign is making a lot of money</a>. People are taking action, at least in their minds, and supporting Invisible Children. This is impressive. A lot of people think that viral videos and social media campaigns are not activism, rather they are <em>slacktivism. </em>But Kony 2012 is showing that with a message that is compelling and a simple donation model, hits can turn into cash.</p>
<p>&gt; People are not very skeptical. The Kony 2012 video is riddled with misstatements. But most people seem not to care. Also, people don&#8217;t vet the charities that they support. Invisible Children is a nice cause, but there are some question marks about its spending. It strikes me as strange that so many people seemed to have donated blindly. The whole video could have been a lie and the organization could have been a sham. Be careful people!</p>
<p>&gt; Is this the best place to spend our money? Can&#8217;t we harness the same passion to save children in our own country? Doesn&#8217;t charity begin at home?</p>
<p>&gt; My last point is more of a question than a lesson. What is all this money going to do? Finance another film? How does Invisible Children intend on taking on a warlord? Pay him off? What&#8217;s the plan here? 100 million hits won&#8217;t help anybody. 100 million dollars might be able to help some of the victims of Kony, but will it? And how?</p>

I love seeing how people react to being informed about another&#8217;s beliefs. I love to watch people who don&#8217;t know that they are being watched.</p>
<p>If you are like me at all. You will like this video.</p>
<p>A young Israeli woman works at a hotel in London that serves kosher food and is designed for orthodox Jews. The conversations that she has with some of the patrons are enlightening. Some people make good impressions, others do not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great reminder to orthodox Jews that we need to be educated on our traditions so that we do not make up nonsensical answers, use a condescending tone, make assumptions and just in general reflect positively upon orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p><em>(I wonder if it is legal to film people without their consent and then post the video on youtube&#8230;)</em></p>
<p>If you have thoughts on the video please share them in the comments.<span id="more-5209"></span></p>

<p>A little while back I posted a link to a really amazing Tumblr blog called &#8220;Dear Photograph&#8221;.</p>
<p>The idea is hard to explain but when you see it for yourself the whole thing makes perfect sense and is quite touching. Dear Photograph is a blog that posts current photos of a place with a smaller old photograph of the same place being held in the same space. So for example you would see a new photo of a home and where the front steps would be there is an old photograph of some people standing at the front steps.</p>
<p>The effect is amazing. The submissions to Dear Photograph can evoke powerful emotions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so cool that I wish I had thought of it myself. Ever since I saw the blog I wished I could do some of my own Dear Photograph submissions.</p>
<p>Apparently, Chevrolet&#8217;s marketing firm wished they had thought of it too.<span id="more-4760"></span></p>
<p>A new ad campaign marking 100 years of Chevy uses the exact same concept by placing old photographs of Chevy cars and trucks in front of present day backgrounds. The resemblance to Dear Photograph is uncanny and obvious.</p>
<p>There is no attribution to Dear Photograph. I assume that Dear Photograph was not part of the campaign. A little Googling told me that I am not the only one to notice the similarities. See this: <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-chevrolet-135963" target="_blank">AdWeek</a> and the comments on YouTube.</p>
<p>It can be argued that the idea is not original to Dear Photograph either. I don&#8217;t know if it or if it is not. I can understand if Dear Photograph is annoyed by their idea being used by Chevy without being compensated for it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is no greater validation for an artist than know that their idea is being used in a multimillion dollar campaign for a 100 year old car company. It must feel great to see their vision on TV and being used commercially. If you think about it, 10 years ago there would have been no way for anyone not an ad executive to have their idea in a commercial. Now, Dear Photograph, a little blog has their idea in a huge commercial. Obviously, they would like to get paid, but it is a huge step forward for the &#8220;suits&#8221; to be taking ideas from bloggers!</p>
<p>Either way, Dear Photograph has gone mainstream and if you want to see Chevy&#8217;s inspiration head on over to their site. I think a Jewish / Israel centric Dear Photograph would be amazing. It would be really cool to see old photos of people in Israel at important sites superimposed over current photos of the same places.</p>
<p>Here is the Chevy ad:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/126571-gilad-shalit-release.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4740" title="126571-gilad-shalit-release" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/126571-gilad-shalit-release.jpg?resize=300%2C168" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>One of the more dramatic events in my lifetime has been the recent release of Gilad Shalit. I think most Jews thought he would never go home. He was released, the price was very high and now a week later we can reflect on the deal and its ramifications.</p>
<p>Perhaps the two biggest complaints that supporters of Israel have expressed are related not to Shalit, but to the 1000+ prisoners exchanged for Shalit. These complaints are divided into two categories. One category refers to the celebrations in Gaza when the prisoners returned. They were given a hero&#8217;s welcome and treated in a way that offended many people who felt that criminals and terrorists should not be celebrated.</p>
<p>I believe this criticism is partially valid. All kinds of prisoners were released. Some were terrorists and murdereres. Others were agitators who jumped the fence or snuck into Israel without permission. They were all released together. The worst offenders were supposedly sent to other countries, not Gaza.</p>
<p>For a governing body to cheer and promote terrorism there is absolutely no justification. It is horrible and should be obvious to any reasonable person that it is bad.</p>
<p>However, I do not take issue with the celebrations of individuals who were welcomed by their families and friends with cheers and whoops of joy. I have seen hardened criminals in American court and seen the reactions of their friends and families when they are released or acquitted. It is the same. I think we can all see that friends and family can be permitted to enjoy the moment their criminal / terrorist family members return home. I do not have a problem with it all.</p>
<p>The second category of complaint refers to the equivocation of some of the media and UN leadership of Shalit and the 1000+ prisoners.<span id="more-4739"></span> A similar complaint has been lodged by some members of the Jewish community against its own members who have equated Shalit with Pollard or Rubashkin. The complaint hods that there is a moral equivalency implied when Shalit and the prisoners are compared. The video below powerfully demonstrates the issue. (Watch it after you finish reading.)</p>
<p>I agree that any moral equivalency is absurd. No normal person could think that Shalit is equal to terrorist or even to Jewish criminals.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily agree that moral equivalency between Shalit and the terrorists was as common or prevalent as some others might perceive. There is a tendency to expect certain things from media coverage. When these expectations are not met one response is to get upset or point out that the media is biased or anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. I think that perhaps the expectations are simply off.</p>
<p>The media is not reading into each and every word it says like a Talmudic passage. They are reporting and for the sake of brevity, interest, ratings, or many other factors may present a headline or story from which something offensive can be inferred. In my opinion this is a useless exercise.</p>
<p>Take the primary example in the video below. The SkyNet reporter segues from the Shalit story to the &#8220;human element&#8221; of the released prisoners. Somehow this is deemed horribly offensive. I just don&#8217;t see it. There is no implied moral equivalency. What is being said is simply what was remarked above. There <em>is </em>a human element when hundreds of people who have been locked up come home. Isn&#8217;t there? So why the outrage?</p>
<p>I prefer to reserve my outrage for the actual words and acts of the despicable terrorists you laugh and giggle when told how many people they have killed. Sick.</p>
<p>Enjoy the video below.</p>

<p>The song is The Bird of Hope, the singer is Mordechai ben David.</p>
<p>For me, this song has always been a powerful metaphor for Yom Kippur. I really wanted to share it with you but it was not available anywhere online. So I decided to do it myself. I made this video <del>yesterday</del> last year. The pictures don&#8217;t do the lyrics justice, but it was worth making the video so everyone could hear the song before Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>Please watch the video and contemplate its important message.<span id="more-4695"></span></p>
<p>No matter where how drastically we fall, we can always rise from the ashes to great heights. We just need to make the right choices.</p>
<p>On a side note, this song was recorded in 1979. Mordechai ben David&#8217;s voice is so incredible in this song. It&#8217;s amazing that he is still recording new songs, but after listening to this, you will note that he a shadow of his former self&#8230;</p>
<p>I want to wish everyone a successful Yom Kippur. <em>Please forgive everyone who may have harmed you</em>. I know I have.</p>
<p>Please share this video to help everyone prepare for Yom Kippur.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/eye.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4542" title="eye" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/eye.jpg?resize=300%2C236" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In a criminal trial, several kinds of evidence are provided by the prosecution to prove the defendant is guilty. The most influential of these forms of evidence is often an eyewitness identification. A case with a positive ID is almost always going to result in a conviction.</p>
<p>The most common cause for an erroneous conviction of an innocent person is eyewitness misidentification. For years, experts have been explaining that misidentification can occur by mistake and with good faith. That doesn&#8217;t make them reliable. It just makes misidentifications into honest mistakes.</p>
<p>In many states legislation has been proposed to curb the effects of eyewitness identification. In New Jersey, the Supreme Court has spoken from the bench in an effort to fix this problem.<span id="more-4541"></span></p>
<p>When an eyewitness identification may be unreliable, the judge in the case is required to hold a hearing to determine the witness&#8217; reliability and then must instruct the jurors how much weight to place on the identification. In most cases the evidence will be heard, but the judge will educate jurors on the reliability of eyewitness identification.</p>
<p>Social science and decades of research have shown that eyewitness identifications are very often unreliable. Factors such as fear, bias, unfamiliarity with the defendant, focusing on the weapon, police misconduct, length of time between the crime and the ID all play into the reliability of the identification. Time and time again, identifications have been shown to be erroneous and have contributed to the death of innocent defendants via the death penalty and decades of prison time for other innocent defendants.</p>
<p>The New Jersey case comes ahead of a highly anticipated United States Supreme Court case next year that will decide an eyewitness identification issue. It is likely that the Supreme Court will follow the model set forth by the New Jersey Supreme Court.</p>

<p>A beautiful cross-section of Jews from around the world enjoyed the lovely musical intonations of Ron Grun. Pacific Jewish Center members showed up to the concert in strong numbers. But the non-members who joined us for the event made the concert even more special.</p>
<p>On another typical Venice Beach Sunday, dozens of folks popped their heads into the shul. Some stayed for the entire concert. Others made stayed briefly.</p>
<p>But everyone enjoyed. Once again, we were proud to spread the light of Torah and Judaism to the Venice Boardwalk community.</p>
<p>It was wonderful meeting all the people who stopped in for some of the concert and I hope we see you again soon.</p>
<p>OUR NEXT EVENT will be an art gallery over Labor Day weekend. Admission will be free.</p>
<p>We hope to see you then.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Goldstein family for sponsoring the Klezmer Concert again.</p>
<p>Enjoy some snippets below.<span id="more-4531"></span> (MY good HD video cameras were not available so you&#8217;ll have to bear with the iPhone HD quality. It&#8217;s pretty good. But not s good as last year&#8217;s video.)</p>

<p>The NY Times has been busy with a story about Ralph Branca and his heritage.</p>
<p>Who is Ralph Branca? He&#8217;s the guy who gave up the &#8220;shot heard &#8217;round the word&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the &#8220;shot heard &#8217;round the world&#8221;? The home run hit by Bobby Thompson of the New York Giants that was immediately followed by &#8220;THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT!&#8221;</p>
<p>Branca has a largely ignominious place in sports lore because he gave up that epic home run.</p>
<p>During an investigative report on his life by reporter Joshua Prager, it was discovered that Branca&#8217;s mother was a Jew who emigrated to the United States in 1901 from what was then Hungary. Branca was as shocked as anyone to learn that his mother was a Jew. Perhaps he was even more shocked to discover that <em>he</em> was a Jew as well. For in Jewish law, if one&#8217;s mother is Jewish, one is Jewish!</p>
<p>Branca was raised Catholic.</p>
<p>As a kid, Branca was a &#8220;Shabbos goy&#8221;, a term I despise for its less than glamorous connotations. He performed certain tasks forbidden for Jews on the Sabbath. (In all likelihood, it was equally impermissible for those Jews to ask young Ralphie to perform those tasks on their behalf, but I digress.) Branca is quoted at the end of the story in the Times as saying that he better remain a Catholic, otherwise he would have been liable for all his &#8220;helpfulness&#8221;. To save his soul, Branca, now 85, says he must remain Catholic.</p>
<p>His faulty logic notwithstanding, Branca is a Jew.<span id="more-4512"></span></p>
<p>At least according to Jewish law he is a Jew.</p>
<p>Alan Dershowitz is of a different mind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Ralph Branca is not a Jew,” said Alan Dershowitz, a Brooklyn-born Dodgers fan, lawyer and Harvard professor. “Whatever the definition, it doesn’t include someone who willingly accepted a different religion. He didn’t stay home on Yom Kippur like Koufax.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Koufax altered strength and guile and knew that you pitch for six days and you rest on the seventh,” he said. “Branca was straight-on; you could see there was nothing Jewish about Ralph Branca.”</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear if Dershowitz made these comments before the revelation that Branca&#8217;s mother was Jewish. If it was before, the big reveal then I am not sure what the Times is using this quote for. It is was after the revelation that Branca&#8217;s mother was a Jew I am completely at lost at how someone&#8217;s non-choice, Branca was raised Catholic or someone pitching style can be the determining factor as to one&#8217;s Jewishness. What in the world is Dershowitz saying?</p>
<p>According to Jewish law Branca is a Jew. Whether he knew it or cared for or not, he is a Jew. In this respect, Judaism is a family. A long lost cousin who did not know he was related to you can&#8217;t be excluded from the family because he has a different style than the rest of the family (if that is even a reasonable assertion, which it is not).</p>
<p>I am disappointed in Dershowitz and I welcome Ralph Branca to the tribe. Even if he was always part of it and even if he doesn&#8217;t want to be&#8230;</p>

<p>Without getting to far afield in the nitty gritty of the local politics, there is an election for a seat in Congress representing the 36th Congressional District on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Democratic candidate is Janice Hahn. She appeared to be a shoo-in for the seat in a fairly moderate to liberal district. One particular issue has turned the tides of the race and created a virtual heat heading into the final weekend.</p>
<p>The issue (this is as &#8220;neutral point of view&#8221; I can put it) is Hahn&#8217;s policies with regard to gang members. In particular she facilitated the placement of criminals as gang interventionists and had them paid via a third party.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to see how this is being portrayed negatively. Or more to the point, why this is being portrayed negatively. <span id="more-4404"></span>The biggest crime issue in Los Angeles is gangs. One of the more effective ways of curbing gang violence is negotiating peace treaties. I met the fellow who negotiated the truce between the Bloods and Crips. It took almost 10 years to form an agreement. (His name is Aquila Sherrils.) Hahn enlisted the help of some senior gang members to negotiate for peace between gangs. These representatives were paid by football legend Jim Brown&#8217;s foundation. She also strongly supported programs to help gang members receive recognition for changing their lives. All of this seems very good.</p>
<p>Yet, Fox LA ran a nearly 10 minute segment on Janice Hahn&#8217;s &#8220;horrifying&#8221; involvement with gang members. The bias and slant in this report is embarrassing (for them) and an indictment on the public. If the public does not want to see programs and initiative such as Ms. Hahn&#8217;s what do they want? If working from within gangs to promote peace treaties is a bad idea, what is a good idea? If it is seen as a blemish on ones record for thinking creatively and bravely about how to solve the gang problems what would a sparkling record look like?</p>
<p>This report has me so upset at Fox, the public and the organizers of Hahn&#8217;s opponent&#8217;s campaign who are text messaging the entire district about this horrible report. Note, the report makes no accusations of wrongdoing or impropriety. It is simply the concept that Hahn is helping gang members that is so obscene that it renders her am unqualified conduct. As one website promoting Hahn&#8217;s indiscretions put it: Hahn is directing public funds to &#8220;support violent, inner-city criminals&#8221;.<br />
Disgraceful.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think.</p>
<p>(Sorry, whoever uploaded this video squished everybody&#8230;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/common-obama1-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4275" title="common-obama1-1" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/common-obama1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C194" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A little controversy arose when the First Lady invited several performers to the White House for an evening of poetry.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounded the invitation of a rapper named Common. The controversy was not over whether rap is actually poetry. It was about the character of this man named Common.</p>
<p>I confess, I never heard of Common before this controversy. But in October 2010 a Foxnews.com report called him a rap legend and told him &#8220;your music is very positive. And you&#8217;re known as the conscious rapper.&#8221; (See this link: <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/4380489/the-hot-zone-common/" target="_blank">Fox News</a>, as seen here:<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/201105100018" target="_blank"> Media Matters</a>.)</p>
<p>Seems like a great choice.</p>
<p>But Bill O&#8217;Reilly disagreed.<span id="more-4274"></span> It was his opinion that having Common sing at the White House was a travesty. His reasoning? Common sings a song in support of a convicted cop killer who was part of the Black Liberation Army. O&#8217;Reilly opines that anyone who sings a song like that must never be allowed to perform at the White House.</p>
<p>Jon Stewart took him to task and O&#8217;Reilly invited him to debate the issue on The O&#8217;Reilly Factor.</p>
<p>This is how it went down [watch this now if you haven&#8217;t already seen it]:</p>
<p><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4ISpkUsBYuc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4ISpkUsBYuc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></p>
<p>Stewart wins this debate. Clearly. There is a selective outrage machine in all of us. In this instance it was O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s selective outrage machine that was exposed as inconsistent if not racist.</p>
<p>It is important to note that although we may have a selective outrage machine, there are very different ways we can deal with that outrage.</p>
<p>I disagree with O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s other premise that if a man sings a song about a cop killer that defines him as a person and any further discussion of that person that does not express outrage over that song is some sort of approval of that song. In other words, just because Common sings one song about a convicted cop killer, that should not disqualify any other positive contributions he can make as as an artist or a human being.</p>
<p>Agreeing with, or celebrating, or hosting someone does not and should not mean that that person has carte blanche approval for anything and everything they do.</p>
<p>Yet this phenomena exists. It exists all over the place. One place it exists is Orthodox Judaism. Especially more insular, right wing brands of Orthodox Judaism (RWOJ).</p>
<p>Theologically and historically speaking, this is an important phenomena in RWOJ. Certain people and their opinions are acceptable, others are not. Thus, the entire life of the person is considered when deciding if their opinion can be relied upon or considered.</p>
<p>This may be important to the theology and history of RWOJ, but I find it unfortunate. Many good ideas could be lost or discarded simply because of the names of the people who thought of them. People are complex. Their ideas in one area might be wrong or unacceptable, but by acknowledging another aspect of their ideas that is not wrong and is acceptable we are not giving approval to the entire corpus of the persons previously held ideas and positions. It&#8217;s a standard that is impossible to uphold. No two people agree on everything. Inevitably everyone can be thrown under the bus for something.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not what happens. What ends up happening is exactly what happened with O&#8217;Reilly. Selective outrage.</p>
<p>In the RWOJ community it can mean that thieves or abusers are still voices that can and must be heard, but others with far less severe crimes, perhaps they wear the wrong head-covering or the wrong color suit, are marginalized and disqualified by the selective outrage machine.</p>
<p>It is completely normal to be selectively outraged. We all have biases and we all have different priorities. The problem is when the selective outrage machine also determines who has a voice and a right to be heard. Then we risk losing important ideas and contributions to our communities. There is no machine I know of that can bring those lost voices back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/presumed-guilty-poster.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4092" title="presumed-guilty-poster" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/presumed-guilty-poster.jpg?resize=214%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This item will not surprise orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>We all know how great a ban can be for business. Just ask Rabbi Nosson Kamenetsky or Rabbi Natan Slifkin how their sales were after their books were banned. Their books became collectors items!</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise that a documentary film banned by the Mexican government is soaring in popularity. The film is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/presumedguilty/" target="_blank">Presumed Guilty</a>&#8221; and I have not seen it yet. So whatever I am writing is based on what I have read and heard from others.</p>
<p>The film is banned because it exposes the Mexican judicial system as a sham. Not only are the trials and proceedings full of injustices, the prison system is equally woeful and inhumane. The protagonist of the film has been excluded as a suspect by all forensic evidence, he has a legitimate alibi and the witness to the crime could not identify him. Yet, he was convicted and re-convicted in a corrupt legal system.</p>
<p>To avoid the embarrasment and the cries to reform the system, Mexico declared the movie illegal and its claims do not need to be addressed.<span id="more-4090"></span></p>
<p>The ban is always used in the same way. To avoid the substantive claims in a book or movie, authority dismisses the book or movie as illegal. That way they don&#8217;t have to deal with the claims.</p>
<p>Luckily, people are smarter than that. When something is banned, people want to know why. They want to know what was so offensive that deserved a ban. Usually, the contraband is found compelling and the people see through the veiled attempt by the authority to pretend that the flaws or issues in their own systems need addressing. If something is ban-worthy, it is probably making good points.</p>
<p>In the case of this movie, it is a point about justice.</p>
<p>In the cases of Rabbis Kamenetsky and Slifkin it was about the fallibility and humanness of rabbinic leaders.</p>
<p>All these examples make great points. If they are wrong, I would love to hear why. I would love to see some evidence to the contrary. But when something is banned and response is not necessary. A ban is the ultimove sign of weakness in authority. When their only defense is &#8220;you can&#8217;t see what they have to say about us&#8221;, their defense is not a defense at all.</p>
<p>The ban on Presumed Guilty has been lifted for the time being. It is back in theaters and DVD sales are soaring. For now&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back, Google did a video like this and it has become a sort of meme. It&#8217;s a cute meme. It takes some creativity and usually its pretty good.</p>
<p>Aish.com did a nice job with this story of the Exodus using the same style.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the story being told in a new medium and while remaining basically true to the text of the story.</p>
<p>So kudos to Aish, enjoy the video and enjoy your pre-Pesach preparations!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/typewriter.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4046" title="typewriter" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/typewriter.jpg?resize=300%2C265" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I read a fascinating article about an interesting phenomena in the NY Times.</p>
<p>Technology pervades our lives. Phones that have little computers inside them that can take lovely photos and videos, share them with the world, access the entire Internet and make a phone call live in our pockets. We have computers at home. We have computers at work. Many people use electronic devices to read books. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/12/23/orthodox-jews-and-e-readers/">Orthodox Jews and E-Readers</a>).</p>
<p>Some people feel like it has gone too far.</p>
<p>As a result, typewriters are surging in popularity. The unwieldy, noisy, with no delete button typewriters of the 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s. I am not that old, but when I was in 2nd grade I remember the school office secretary had a typewriter. But it was fancy and used a screen to show what you were typing, even had an automatic delete function and was not black metal. Those are not the popular typewriters. People want the old fashioned ones.<span id="more-4045"></span></p>
<p>A really nice point is made in the article by a Ms. Kowalski:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“You type so much quicker than you can think on a computer,” Ms. Kowalski said. “On a typewriter, you have to think.”</em></p>
<p>Writing on a computer is like using a pencil. Typing on a typewriter is using pen, or perhaps more like chiseling into a stone. Because we can type faster than we write, sometimes we write things that are incorrect, or stupid. The same thing happens when we speak before we consider the weight of our words. It can be a great exercise in cognition to type without the luxury of delete. I had a half a thought to publish this post in typewriter style, that is, without deleting or modifying anything. It would have been incoherent. I can barely write one sentence without making a correction or two, or three.</p>
<p>But the message is clear. Sometimes we do need to slow down.</p>
<p>Another great lesson I learned from the typewriter enthusiasts is the need to focus. Just while writing this blog post, I have checked and replied to email, replied to a Twitter conversation and commented on a Facebook post. There is something about using a uni-tasker. A typewriter can only do one thing. It helps one to focus and I suppose that is a good thing too.</p>
<p>The last thing I take from this typewriter revival is a bit of nostalgia. Some of us have it, some of us don&#8217;t. But in orthodox Jewish life there is much nostalgia. One of the greatest areas of this nostalgia is in the area of Torah study. Old books are treasured and revered. Old printings of those books are treasured and revered. Most significantly, old ideas are treasured and revered.</p>
<p>Using a book to study Torah is the standard. Torah scholars pore over books with ink and paper every day. Many of those texts are available digitally. But the old fashioned way lives on. When no one in the world is reading books anymore, I am positive that Torah will still be studied from books and read during services from scrolls. That nostalgia is built into Judaism. We revere the ancient, we respect the past, we look back to our parents and grand parents with love and admiration and we integrate all that into our present and future.</p>
<p>Personally, I love old things. Maybe one day I will get myself a typewriter, but until then I will need to practice typing more effectively the first time around&#8230;</p>

<p>We sometimes forget how fortunate we are. We have access to the greatest inventions, medical care, information, comfortable living conditions, every kind of food under the sun and things our great grandparents only could have dreamed of. Sure we have our probelms too. But our problems are mostly &#8220;<a href="http://therealfirstworldproblems.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">First World Problems</a>&#8220;. The Internet goes down during an epic Internet battle, our cell phone drops an important call, our takeout food is a bit soggy etc etc etc. These are First World Problems.</p>
<p>Around the world, others have Third World Problems. Dirty water, no medical care, hunger, extreme poverty, no electricity etc etc etc. Depending on where we are in the world, our problems are to varying degrees. The solutions to those problems depends on our ingenuity, willingness to think out of the box and creativity. Everywhere you go, people are dealing with whatever obstacles present themselves. Or sometimes people stagnate and resign themselves to their problems and don&#8217;t seek solutions. To me, that is failure.</p>
<p>Throughout history, Jewish people have use difficult situations to improve the world.<span id="more-4029"></span> In fact, the Talmud, one of the greatest gifts to mankind, is really a result of persectution. Due to the banning of Torah study and a lack of communication between various academies it became necessary to record the Talmud for posterity. Imagine if they had simply thrown in the towel and felt their impossible situation had no solution. The world would be a far darker place.</p>
<p>In our own lives we may be riddled with complications or issues and we don&#8217;t know how to extricate ourselves from our situation or fix what is broken. That is a sad place to be. We can all suffer from lack of inspiration at times. If you are feeling even just a tad uninspired I have the perfect way to jumpstart your creative juices. Watch this video.</p>
<p>On a floating village in Thailand called Koh Panyee the youth had nowhere to play soccer. But they needed an outlet. So they got creative and it paid off for them in a big way. The short film is based on the true story from 1986.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>Three uniquely Jewish music styles in one concert. Three masters of their craft performing together. Three entertainers worth seeing on their own are performing together on one stage in Los Angeles on March 30 2011.</p>
<p>The Soul of Jewish Music with Itzhak Perlman, Cantor Yitzchok Meir Helfgot and a Klezmer Ensemble promises to be an amazing night of Jewish music. It is not often that classical, klezmer and cantorial music styles share a stage, but this concert will do just that.</p>
<p>Not to mention, one of my favorite comedians, Elon Gold will be performing as well. Elon performed for an organization I worked for previously and he was a huge hit. He is a TV star and stand-up comedy star and he tells some of the best &#8220;Jewish jokes&#8221; I have ever heard.</p>
<p>I hope I can get tickets for this event (they are expensive) and hope I can attend. If you live in Los Angeles, and can afford it, don&#8217;t miss it.<span id="more-3944"></span></p>
<p>If I sound excited it is because I am. And this is not a paid for or sponsored advertisement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team-photo-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3776" title="team-photo-1" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team-photo-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Compton is one of the toughest neighborhoods in Los Angeles. It has been ranked as the 17th most dangerous city in America. Gangs are a part of daily life in Compton. The streets are run by ex-cons, cons and future cons. Drugs and death pervade the very air.</p>
<p>Gang life is usually not a choice for folks growing up in these neighborhoods. It&#8217;s like being born into a family. You&#8217;re in because you&#8217;re born in. It is extremely difficult to break free from the gangs. But it can be done.</p>
<p>I think it is obvious that providing non-violent outlets for youth is an important tool for helping youths avoid the gang lifestyle. <span id="more-3775"></span>The problem is that most &#8220;outlets&#8221; don&#8217;t create the family feel, structure and sense of belonging that a gang provides. The exception to that is sports. Being on a team, especially a good team feeds the same hunger that a gang feeds. Unfortunately, sports teams are also run over with gangs. The teams represent the gangs. The winners assert dominance over the losing gang.</p>
<p>On a deeper level there is another flaw with most sports as an alternative to gang life. Sports don&#8217;t really demand etiquette and respect. Trash talking is part of the game. Then there is the violence. Basketball, soccer and football, the most popular &#8220;pick up&#8221; sports in SoCal are rough and tough games. There is jostling, tackling, fouls and much contact between players. One could say that sports feed into the violent gang culture to a degree.</p>
<p>That is why this BBC report on a Cricket team from Compton is extra remarkable. Cricket has pageantry, etiquette and respect. It is the ultimate gentleman&#8217;s game. Somehow, the sport has caught on in Compton. The team has toured across the world drawing rave reviews from more experienced cricket teams in real cricket countries.</p>
<p>The team has been somewhat successful in getting kids off the streets but they have higher goals. They want to build a cricket field in Compton. I wish them the best of luck.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/super-bowl-2011-try-2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3725" title="superbowl 2011" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/super-bowl-2011-try-2.png?resize=207%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This Sunday, the most celebrated American tradition returns with its yearly dose of football. It&#8217;s the Super Bowl (TM). I know, I&#8217;m supposed to call it the &#8220;Big Game&#8221; or something nebulous like that, but I won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>For football fans, the Super Bowl is usually one of the most disappointing weeks of football. That&#8217;s because a team, OTHER THAN YOURS, wins the darn thing. But for non-football fans, the game is a yearly infusion of football and bits of entertainment spliced into 30 second spots called commercials.</p>
<p>This year, Fox is selling Super Bowl ads for about $2 million dollars a pop. It is the most watched television event every year and the cost of the commercial time creates a huge buzz surrounding the ads. Corporations dedicate millions of dollars to producing their Super Bowl ads and the ads live on far beyond the Super Bowl via YouTube and blogs inviting viewers to cast their votes as to their favorites.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Super Bowl is a huge opportunity for a company to generate buzz and market its products. Last year I wrote about the Pro-Life ad that was unnecessarily controversial (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/28/tim-tebows-pro-life-superbowl-ad-is-heartwarming-and-reckless/">Tim Tebow&#8217;s Pro-Life Super Bowl Ad is Heartwarming and Reckless</a> and then <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/07/retraction-tim-tebow-ad-was-harmless-not-reckless/">RETRACTION: Tim Tebow Ad WAS Harmless NOT Reckless</a>).<span id="more-3724"></span></p>
<p>Sometimes the ads that don&#8217;t get aired are even more interesting than the ads that do get aired.</p>
<p>This year several ads have been banned from airing during the Super Bowl. These bans are not from the FCC. They are self-censoring bans by Fox.</p>
<p>One ad is by Ashley Madison. This is a company that helps folks in committed relationships have an affair. Their slogan is &#8220;Life is short. Have an affair.&#8221; Their CEO is upset that his company&#8217;s ad was rejected it by Fox. He called it censorship. Well yes, it is censorship. The question is if it is warranted.</p>
<p>Another censored ad was an ad that could be viewed as residing on the completely opposite spectrum of morality. This ad was advising people to look to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_3:16" target="_blank">John 3:16</a> for inspiration. Fox rejected this ad because it contained &#8220;Religious Doctrine&#8221;. This is also censorship. The question is if it is warranted.</p>
<p>I think that both commercials are appropriate for Television. However, they are not appropriate for the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is a family television program. It is watched by the same people who watch Saturday morning cartoons and PBS Kids. Ads that assume that the maturity and sophistication of the audience is over 15 years old are plainly inappropriate.</p>
<p>Ashley Madison can advertise on shows and programs that adults are the primary viewers. Children are not the audience that Ashley Madison wants to target and worse, children don&#8217;t have the maturity to deal with ads that may cause them to contemplate issues that are not appropriate for their demographic, like infidelity. An ad that tells viewers to look up John 3:16, which by the way, says that with Jesus you will be alright, the inference being that without Jesus you won&#8217;t, is not appropriate for children who think they are alright without Jesus because that is how their parents raised them. The Super Bowl is a family event and the ads should reflect that reality.</p>
<p>Personally, I find ads for Viagra and Cialis or other adult only products and services during sporting events offensive. These two ads are even worse. My suggestion for parents watching sporting events with their kids is simply not to watch commercials. First of all, you will spare them the sick consumerism of the West for a little while longer. But more importantly, the advertisers are not considering the effects of their ads of kids and sometimes the ads are just not appropriate for them. Do them and yourself a favor. Skip the ads.</p>
<p>How? Get a DVR. Or turn off the TV for the commercials. Or just have the kids engage in another activity aside from watching the commercials.</p>
<p>I think Fox is in the right for censoring some Super Bowl commercials. I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing even more censorship for family programs like the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>And as a Ravens fan: Go Packers!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Ted-Williams-Homeless-Golden-Voice.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3631" title="Ted-Williams-Homeless-Golden-Voice" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Ted-Williams-Homeless-Golden-Voice.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>You&#8217;ve all heard of Ted Williams. Not the baseball player who is cryogenically frozen, the homeless man turned Radio Personality and media darling.</p>
<p>His story is inspiring. But it&#8217;s also really depressing. Why?</p>
<p>The book / movie about Michael Oher (Go Ravens!), The Blind Side, tells the true story of a homeless, gentle giant who can play football. His background is typical for an inner city mionority. His parents were incapable of raising him or his siblings.</p>
<p>In the southern hospitality tradition, an affluent, influential family takes him in and raises him as their own. They help him with his school work and his football. Overall, he is a success and winds up in the NFL and an anchor player on a team that has been in the playoffs in each of his first two seasons. It&#8217;s a great story. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039333838X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=039333838X&quot;&gt;The Blind Side (Movie Tie-in Edition)  (Movie Tie-in Editions)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=">Read the book</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VECM6S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VECM6S">see the movie</a>. Either way, it&#8217;s a powerful story</p>
<p>What is the real message of the story?<span id="more-3630"></span> Leigh Anne Tuohy, the real woman who adopted Oher in real life says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There are a million Michaels. Not every kid has the potential to become a star player in the NFL, but that kid may be the person who grows up to cure cancer, or who becomes a great husband or wife to someone.</em></p>
<p>The &#8220;Michaels&#8221; are living in horrible conditions with little to no chance of discovering their gifts and talents. Theirs is a life of survival. And many do not.</p>
<p>The urban, gang riddled centers of our cities is sacrificing their youth. And lest you think it&#8217;s not YOUR problem, it is. The cure for cancer is in one of their potential lives. The next great discovery is being lost because so many of our youth don&#8217;t have the opportunity to hone their skills and talents.</p>
<p>There are a million Michaels. Their plight is a social problem that affects all of us. Too many intelligent, charismatic people are lost to the inner city.</p>
<p>Ted Williams is another exception. He was homeless. He had no shot at a better life. His talents would have remained hidden too. But he got lucky.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t rely on the good fortune which befell Micheal Oher and Ted Williams to save an entire generation of lost minds.</p>
<p>I will never forget the enduring message of the ubiquitous <a href="http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=134">PSA</a> from the United Negro College Fund. &#8220;<em>A mind is a terrible thing to waste</em>&#8220;. When I was a kid, I heard that slogan a million times. One time for each of the million Michaels.</p>
<p>A mind <strong><em>is</em></strong> a terrible thing to waste. Yet, as a society, we do it all the time&#8230;</p>
<p>To me, that is the real, and depressing, message of the Ted Williams story.</p>
<p>Here is the original UNCF PSA:</p>

<p>If you know me well, you will not be surprised that I protested the early release of this video by not watching it until a few moments ago. It&#8217;s a great video. Google uses their products in a bit of justifiable self promotion to remind us of what we searched for on the Internet this year. The production quality is excellent. The content is even better. The video moved me and I think it will move you as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad Google made this video and I am happy to share it with you.</p>
<p>Just think, you never know who or what will change to world. Next year, it could be you&#8230;</p>

<p>I was asked what I felt about the repeal of Don&#8217;t Ask Don&#8217;t Tell. Short answer: It&#8217;s about time.</p>
<p>DADT made it illegal for anyone who was openly gay to join the military. It also prohibited military recruiters from asking potential military enlistees about their sexuality.</p>
<p>Perhaps 17 years ago this was a step forward, today it is a backwards policy.</p>
<p>A policy that so blatantly discriminated against a significant portion of our country&#8217;s citizens and told them that they were not welcome to assist in the defense of their own country is a bad policy. No matter where one stands on the issue of gay rights and gay marriage, there is no legitimate reason to exclude those who are gay from proudly serving their country.<span id="more-3516"></span></p>
<p>In the United States it is not a crime to be gay. It should not hinder one&#8217;s ability to be a patriot either.</p>
<p>I understand that the military may be a slightly hostile place to those who are gay. That is an issue that gay soldiers will need to deal with. They are used to be outsiders and I am sure they will be just fine in the military.</p>
<p>As the president said today: &#8220;We are a nation of &#8216;<em>out of many, come one</em>&#8216;&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am proud to be one of the many.</p>
<p>Watch the singing below. If you don&#8217;t care for the speeches and just want to see the actual &#8220;John Hancock&#8221; skip to the end around the 25 minute mark.</p>

<p>Watch this video and you&#8217;ll get a real feel for what it was like out there on Sunday. If you look at all the peripheral people watching from the sidelines you can see how many folks were able to enjoy the ceremony on the Venice Boardwalk.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has a nice piece on Dr. Jonathan Halpert. He is the YU basketball coach of 39 years. That is a long time to be doing any job. Certainly in a field dominated by the coaching carousel, it is a worthy achievement.</p>
<p>The article is nice. It tells of the challenges of managing a team of Orthodox Jewish basketball players. Shabbos and Holidays are off limits to games and practices. The daily grind of a YU student includes religious studies until mid afternoon and then secular classes that can go until 8 PM.</p>
<p>Halpert gives the reader insight into his coaching and life philosophy and as a reader I found him to be inspiring.<span id="more-3420"></span></p>
<p>In the article, there is one anecdote about making an impact on a player&#8217;s life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There was the player who was cut but served as team manager for a year, made the squad the following season and hit a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. Dr. Halpert made five DVDs of the game for the player to show to his children. &#8220;That&#8217;s good to keep you going another five years,&#8221; he said.</em></p>
<p>A nice story. But even nicer because I happen to know that player.</p>
<p>That player is Aryeh Magilnick. Son of PJC members <strong>Judd</strong> and <strong>Denise Magilnick</strong>.</p>
<p>And I happen to know what shot Halpert was referring to. And now you do too.</p>
<p>Click the video to watch Aryeh Magilnick hit a classic buzzer beater. (Assume there is a buzzer and that the shot was released just before the buzzer sounded.)</p>

If you haven&#8217;t, where have you been? I admit it, this one should have been first.</p>
<p>This is a great addition to the Jewish Chanukah music genre. It loses a few points for not being an original tune, but the guys do a great job &#8220;making it their own&#8221; as Simon Cowell would say. And the lyrics seem a little forced at times.</p>
<p>But the production is pretty good overall and the popularity of the video speaks for itself. Oh, and I would have loved to see a cameo by Taio Cruz. Maybe in the remix&#8230;</p>
<p>They have now been featured on <a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/12/03/hanukkah-video-helps-jews-sing-new-tune" target="_blank">CNN</a>, <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/music/festival_of_lights_burns_up_charts_SqloBtbM03L0i9humt3YtO" target="_blank">The NY Post</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/30/dynamite-hanukkah-remix-m_n_789765.html" target="_blank">The Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://plj.com/Article.asp?id=2039446&amp;spid=" target="_blank">WPLJ.com</a> and every single one of my Jewish friends&#8217; Facebook page.</p>
<p>Enjoy the Maccabeats singing Candlelight&#8230;<span id="more-3399"></span></p>

<p>One of those songs was the now famous Chanukah song. With its pop culture references, wacky rhymes and Sandler&#8217;s whiny voice, it has become the staple of Chanukah songs that non-Jews know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/call_of_duty_black_ops2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3267" title="call_of_duty_black_ops2" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/call_of_duty_black_ops2-300x187.jpg?resize=300%2C187" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Violence in video games is a subject that has become a hot topic. Some feel there should be more regulation of violence in video games. Some have called for banning violent games for children. In California a board of censors has been proposed and the Supreme Court of the United States recently heard arguments for and against creating a censorship bureau.</p>
<p>The case turns of whether video games are protected under the 1st Amendment and whether that protection should be suspended in favor of protecting children from violent video content.</p>
<p>The ruling will be an important ruling for an industry that is larger than the Television and Movie industries in America.</p>
<p>One of the more violent game series released a new installment today. Call of Duty: Black Ops<span id="more-3266"></span> puts the player in the middle of a cold-war era war. The player controls machine guns, tanks and rocket launchers in their quest to kill and destroy the enemy. It is highly anticipated and is supposed to be the &#8220;next great game&#8221;.</p>
<p>Personally, I would rather not see the government censor for the sake of children. Parents are supposed to censor for their children and expecting the government to babysit our children is lazy, irresponsible and far more dangerous than the violence contained within the video games. Parents like to pass the buck. It&#8217;s easy to tell a child &#8220;Sorry, the law makes it illegal to buy that game for you&#8221;. It&#8217;s not so easy to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that game is suitable for someone your age&#8221;. We always like to blame someone else for depriving children&#8230;</p>
<p>The biggest difference between violence in video games and tv / movies is that the violence in a game is controlled by the player. In the player&#8217;s mind, he or she is committing the act of violence. In a show or movie, the viewer is not a participant in the violence, they are a spectator. Games are great because of their &#8220;immersiveness&#8221; and that is also what some feel makes them more dangerous than seeing violence on tv or in a movie.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops does not shy away from the allure of the immersive nature of the game. In fact they glorify it with their television commercial for the game. The ad features regular folks in their regular clothing, answering their cell phones while firing their weapons in a war scene. The ad has people of all races, genders and levels of fame &#8211; it includes Kobe Bryant and Jimmy Kimmel as well. The whole point of the ad is that when we play a game we feel like we are in the game.</p>
<p>In my opinion. the ad is ingenious. It really captures the &#8220;everyman&#8221; playing the game and becoming part of the game. However, the ad is not without controversy. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/11/call-of-dutys-twisted-advertising-campaign/66293/" target="_blank">Some say</a> it makes the game &#8220;too real&#8221; and it is disturbing to consider the effects of a &#8220;real&#8221; war. A game can look almost real, but never will it look really real, as it does in the ad.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t bother me. The ad is great marketing for a controversial product that adults can choose if they would like to purchase. There&#8217;s no sense avoiding the thing that makes these games fun&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is the ad. What do you think?</p>

<p>As reported on DigitalJournal.com (original source: Al Jazeera), a woman in China was forced to abort her 8 month fetus to comply with China&#8217;s One Child rule. The Chinese Government enforces its arcane One Child Law with forced abortions and fines. Aside from its obtuse totalitarian nature, the result, in a society that values men over women, is a huge gap in men and women which presents another set of social problems. (see: <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=there-are-more-boys-than-girls" target="_blank">Scientific American</a>)</p>
<p>This woman was dragged from her home and brought to a facility where her fetus was brutally aborted in its womb.</p>
<p>The story is disturbing from a human perspective but hopeful for the future.<span id="more-3195"></span> This abortion (if you can call an 8 month fetus killed inside the womb, an &#8220;abortion&#8221;, was performed by government officials. The woman is from a modern city and her family does not know how the information was leaked to a Chinese website similar to Twitter.com. Nevertheless, a subsequent interview with her husband on YouTube posted by Al Jazeera has over 30,000 hits and it tells their story.</p>
<p>Information cannot be controlled anymore. The Internet and its social media sharing sites give everyone with an Internet connection unbridled access to the entire world. A message can be broadcast and heard by an infinite audience.</p>
<p>In China, the stirrings of a revolution may be beginning with Twitter and YouTube.</p>
<p>Gladwell, take note.</p>

One of the more interesting people I have met in my Shul is Audi Gozlan.</p>
<p>Audi is an orthodox Jewish Yogi (also a lawyer) from Montreal Canada. He visits Venice on a regular basis to try and satisfy the local thirst for innovative and exciting Yoga programs. Audi teaches a discipline of Yoga that he personally developed called Kabalah Yoga.</p>
<p>Kabalah Yoga has become quite popular and Audi session&#8217;s are packed with instructors who want to teach Kabalah Yoga. Some sessions have upwards of 200 people in attendance. The attendees are usually quite surprised when they see Audi. He looks very religious and they start to think they are in the wr0ng place. But when Audi starts his session, they are shocked to see this man in a kipa and silver beard contort his body like a skilled Yogi.<span id="more-3150"></span></p>
<p>The poses of Kabalah Yoga are in the shape of the letters of the Hebrew Aleph-Bet. The letters of the Hebrew Aleph-Bet have been interpreted in many ways. There is an entire corpus of study that uses the letters, their shapes, their sounds and their numerical values as tools for unlocking Torah secrets.</p>
<p>Audi is using them to unlock secrets of the human body.</p>
<p>I confess to never having participated in one of Audi&#8217;s sessions. But from what I hear, they are incredible. In Canada, a prime time Cable television show is being produced starring Audi and Kabalah Yoga. We may get it in the United States before long as well.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in Yoga in general I am sure you will find Audi&#8217;s website and videos fascinating.</p>
<p>If you want more information, check out Kabalah Yoga at <a href="http://www.kabalahyoga.com/" target="_blank">http://www.kabalahyoga.com/</a> and on Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Kabalah-Yoga/189918567398" target="_blank">on their page</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a very cool (well produced) sample video.</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s Torah portion was Noach. In the reading, God promises that there will never be a flood that decimates mankind like the flood that wreaked havoc to the generation of Noah. As a sign of this promise, God points to the rainbow and says that the rainbow will be the reminder of this covenant.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/08/live-like-a-rainbow-a-guest-post/">Live Like A Rainbow | A Guest Post</a> for a wonderful explanation of why the rainbow was chosen to represent this covenant.</p>
<p>Anyway, this past January we all met the Double Rainbow guy. I planned to post it this week but of course I forgot. I was reminded about it after services when <strong>Dana Abrams </strong>asked me if I knew about the Double Rainbow video. (Of course I do&#8230;)</p>

Today would have been his 70th birthday.</p>
<p>And Google is celebrating with a special doodle in honor of John Lennon. Except this doodle is not a sketch, it is an animated video.</p>
<p>See it for yourself by going to <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google.com</a> (and turn off all iGoogle settings or special backgrounds)</p>
<p>The animation is set to music. The 30 second clip is taken from Imagine.</p>
<p>There could be no more important sentiment for this week&#8217;s Torah portion. My father&#8217;s dvar Torah (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/08/live-like-a-rainbow-a-guest-post/">Live Like A Rainbow | A Guest Post</a>) echoes the words of Imagine beautifully.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I hope someday you&#8217;ll join us / and the world will live as one&#8221;</em></p>

Yesterday we hosted a Klezmer concert on the Beach and it was a smashing success!</p>
<p>Dr. Ellie Goldstein&#8217;s close friend has been playing for Dr. Goldstein and his friends at Dr. Goldstein&#8217;s home for many years. Ron Grun (along with Ken Husbands) are very talented klezmer musicians and close friends of Dr. Goldstein.</p>
<p>Over the last year, PJC has been privileged to have Dr. Goldstein and his friends join our shul. One of the many perks of their involvement was the concert taking place in the shul.<span id="more-2773"></span></p>
<p>About 60-70 people attended the concert and many others stopped by for a quick listen and carried on their way along the boardwalk. We are so appreciative that Dr. Goldstein shared the concert with us and the entire beach community.</p>
<p>The concert was great. I confess to not being a Konnoisseur of Klezmer and I was very impressed. The music was great wonderful and the explanations that our performers provided were very interesting. I am so glad that so many folks were able to join us and stop by to get a taste of our shul and the friendliness of our community.</p>
<p>We look forward to more events like this in the future.</p>
<p>If case you missed it, here is a sample of the concert. (And next time be there!)</p>

<p>Sometimes I see video on YouTube that I cannot help but share with you.</p>
<p>This 13 second gem was sent to me by a friend.</p>
<p>It appeals to my sense of humor. It actually made me laugh. Background story below&#8230;</p>
<p>Enjoy.<span id="more-2742"></span></p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EkrgsCHc_Ns?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EkrgsCHc_Ns?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>My friend was in crazy traffic (not crazy like the 3 month backup in China) and he had his tallis and shofar in the car and his friend had a camera. They were passing an Ikea and my friend chuckles to himself Ikeaaaa (sounds like Tekiaaaah) and the video was born&#8230;</p>
<p>(Further explanation: The shofar makes three sounds. One is called tekia. On Rosh Hashana someone calls out each shofar blast before it is blown. So before tekia he chants &#8220;tekiaaa&#8221;.)</p>

I confess to never seeing the ad on TV but I commend Verizon for putting their ads on YouTube. Sometimes ads are art. This is one of those times.</p>
<p>I also admit to using Verizon for absolutely zero services. I don&#8217;t like them very much, I think their logo is dated, their name is weird and their customer service is deplorable. But I know a good ad when I see one.</p>
<p>Do I think this ad translates into sales? Probably not.</p>
<p>It remains an excellent piece of art.<span id="more-2723"></span></p>
<p>Before Web 2.0 (user created content on the web) the public were consumers and not producers of content. That meant that a very select group of advantaged people became the voice of the people. Their opinions were the only opinions that mattered. This goes contrary to the American spirit of &#8220;We the People&#8221;.</p>
<p>That has all changed. The people have a voice. That voice is important (and can be disconcerting when we lose it, see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/13/your-unique-voice-and-a-kafkaesque-experience/">Your Unique Voice and A Kafkaesque Experience</a>). YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X36ACwwyscY" target="_blank">which will become YouTwitFace in the year 3000</a>) Blogging and commenting are the voice of the people. It is an almost completely democratic universe. If your content is good, people will read it or watch or discuss it. It&#8217;s a win for everyone.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t get it &#8211; watch the ad.</p>
<p>This ad gets it.</p>
