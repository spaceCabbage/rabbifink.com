				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>In this week&#8217;s Yated, Rabbi Birnbaum writes a pretty offensive article aimed at the modern orthodox community. In private and public correspondence the article is being heavily criticized for its many flaws.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wish to discuss its salient points, errors, or fallacies here or anywhere else for that matter. I am not interested in debating or fighting with Yated people about the two different communities. It&#8217;s pointless and I am sick of it.</p>
<p>Instead I want to propose a solution.<span id="more-7434"></span></p>
<p>Much of the heated exchange between the yeshivish and modern orthodox communities is based on a lot of misinformation and hearsay. There is very little communication between the two groups. Rarely do the two groups work together to solve social or political issues. There are no formal forums where both communities interact in writing. Facebook is the closest thing we have to a common area for discussion and I have been blessed to host many conversations on my Facebook page where people from across the spectrum interact. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>In the old days we lived among one another. We shared resources. We worked together on common issues. There was a rapport. Today our respective communities are so vibrant and are thriving. We don&#8217;t need each other. We stand apart, separated by the tiniest of margins. It&#8217;s a blessing that we have become so strong as individual groups but in my mind it has caused this divide.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7435" alt="Reaching out" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/handshake.jpg" /></p>
<p>True, we disagree on a lot. We disagree about the value and power of Daas Torah. We disagree about Chazal and science. We disagree on the value of full time learning and how long it is appropriate. We disagree on the importance of fathers providing for their family. We disagree on the level of insularity. We disagree on the harms of media consumption. We disagree on Zionism. We disagree on the flexibility of some areas of halacha. We disagree on the emphasis on chumros. Yes, we disagree. But in the end, this is a minuscule fraction of what we agree upon. We agree on Torah M&#8217;Sinai. We agree on Rambam. We agree on Shulchan Aruch. We agree on R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein. We basically agree on Israel. We agree on America. We basically agree on education for children. We agree on so much.</p>
<p>Yet, as we have noted many times, when we are similar to one another we seek ways to distinguish ourselves from one another. That&#8217;s what has happened here. We&#8217;ve divided ourselves over petty matters and it&#8217;s starting to affect our midos toward each other.</p>
<p>The solution here is quite simple. People from all walks of life need to get together and talk. We need to have Shabbatons for all kinds of people to enjoy the company of one another. We need to tackle issues of common concern together. We need a formal place to talk to each other instead of about each other. I doubt Rabbi Birnbaum would have dropped his article as a comment on Ha&#8217;emtza or even on my Facebook page (although I have gotten worse). But he&#8217;s writing for Yated readers and somehow (read: the Internet) the modern orthodox community gets ahold of the article, reads it, and to them he sounds off the wall. It would be so much more productive to talk to each other rather than writing screeds on blogs or &#8220;olde tyme&#8221; blogs (newspapers) like the Yated.</p>
<p>The modern orthodox community must be able to articulate its positions from a place of strength and confidence. The yeshivish community must be able to express its positions with less bombast. Both communities must try to hear the other side. But most of all, this conversation should not be between strangers, it should be between friends.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got to figure out a way to have friends from across the spectrum of orthodox Judaism. The issues have to be personalized by the humanity of relationships.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#8217;t work and we still can&#8217;t find a way to communicate civilly and productively, I&#8217;ll try to think of something else. But in the meantime, l&#8217;maan Hashem, let&#8217;s try to do this right.</p>
<p>This is a formal invitation to engage in a round table or panel discussion on the issues that are plaguing our communities. Let&#8217;s talk to each other, not about each other.</p>
<p>I am happy to host or attend such a conversation. If you are interested, please contact me. Send this to people from both sides of this issue and let&#8217;s make it happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7250" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /></a>The war over MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is rising to a crescendo. The mouthpiece of the Ultra-Orthodox American establishment is the Yated Ne&#8217;eman. The Yated and its Matzav.com website are <a href="http://www.yated.com/dov-lipman--bad-choice-to-keynote-rca-convention.7-977-7-.html" target="_blank">leading the charge to discredit and demonize Lipman</a> in every way possible. Meanwhile, the Centrist Orthodox Americans are watching from the sidelines as they watch a potential hero go to zero. The Modern Orthodox Jewish community is becoming enraged as they see their values trudged upon by their charedi brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess.</p>
<p>Two important voices from the moderate camp have invited Lipman to speak. The RCA Convention will be headlined by Lipman and the BAYT Shul in Toronto is featuring Lipman as a Scholar in Residence the last week in June.</p>
<p>For these grievous sins, Lipman, the RCA, and BAYT have come under a severe assault of attacks from the Yated and Matzav. Articles calling for boycotts of these fine institutions, articles condemning the the decision makers and rabbinic leadership of both institutions, and of course articles enumerating the horrible sins of Lipman as ammunition for their war appear regularly in their pages.<span id="more-7249"></span></p>
<p>The thrust of their arguments against Lipman focus on isolated incidents, out of context quotes, but most of all guilt by association.</p>
<p>I think this is a very important point. There are pundits who &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; to spin conspiracy tales on a daily basis. People believe it. Others just disqualify the opinions or ideas of others because they have a second cousin who gave money to someone else who has a nephew in Al Qaeda. People seem to be okay with this too. For some, guilt by association is actual guilt. For these people, who you know and with whom you associate determine your credibility.</p>
<p>Obviously, this parlor game is ridiculous. If you search long enough you can connect any two people in the world. Guilt by association is terrible way to make a point. Assuming that the two people are associated, there is no evidence that they agree on anything. They could hate each other. Or they could agree on one thing and completely disagree on another. It&#8217;s pure scare tactics and dishonesty to impugn people because of loose ties or even strong ties that they may have with others who might be different or even dangerous.</p>
<p>The same exact thing is happening now in the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish media.</p>
<p>Lipman is in the same party as Yair Lapid? And Lapid&#8217;s father, Tommy, was virulently anti-orthodox? Lipman must also be anti-orthodox! The RCA asked Lipman to speak? The RCA must agree with everything Yair Lapid says too! BAYT invited Lipman for Shabbos? BAYT is clearly anti-Torah.</p>
<p>These are the arguments being made.</p>
<p>The non-Ultra-Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t play this game. They would prefer to hear challenging ideas and thought provoking conversation than disqualify any dissenters by way of guilt by association. Does the RCA agree with every single thing Lipman says? Probably not. No two people agree on everything! Does BAYT co-sign every single thing Lipman has ever done? Of course not. But both institutions pride themselves on appealing to a broad spectrum of orthodox Jews and care passionately about matters of great communal importance. Thus, Lipman is a great candidate for a talk in both places.</p>
<p>But the uber-charedi world it doesn&#8217;t work like that. Unless someone is 100% kosher, they can&#8217;t get to the table. No matter how salient their points may be, they don&#8217;t have the opportunity to be heard. Worse, when two people are associated, and person A says or does something controversial, everyone runs to person B and asks if person B &#8220;holds of&#8221; what person A did. It&#8217;s ridiculous! People can disagree. People can have different opinions. Why is it even expected that if person B associates with person A they would agree with everything person A does? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>This is the best way to seek and destroy any dissent or debate. There is no room for dissent or debate when as soon as someone dissents or debates all that person&#8217;s associates are impugned and they are forced to distance themselves from the dissenter or debater. Nothing could be more chilling.</p>
<p>The other way is to analyze ideas, not people. Rambam writes &#8220;Hear truth from whoever says it.&#8221; These are wise words. The source of an idea is only secondary to the content of the idea. Great people can say stupid things and stupid people can say great things. It&#8217;s terribly insecure and unwise to automatically eliminate so many voices simply because they are guilty by association.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the primary issue that is at play here. Since Lipman is straddling two worlds, he is by definition persona non grata in the Ultra-Orthodox world. One can&#8217;t be for Torah and also cavort with people who are not for Torah. Therefore he is automatically wrong and all the rules of fair play and honesty are no longer relevant. He is a threat who must be stopped. He is not a voice that must be answered. This is the only explanation for the completely disingenuous and false attacks against Lipman.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old argument within orthodox Judaism. For some time now there has been resistance against fostering debate and conversation amongst people with differing views and perspectives. Worse, it has long been established that orthodox Rabbis may not sit on organizations with non-orthodox Jews lest it be perceived as endorsement of non-orthodox values. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a great tactic, nor do I think it&#8217;s wise in the long run. Writing for Tradition Magazine, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/23256285" target="_blank">Rabbi Shubert Spero addressed this issue in 1966</a> and we can see how things have changed since then. Rabbi Spero was writing about engaging non-orthodox Jews. Engaging orthodox Jews wasn&#8217;t an issue in 1966.</p>
<p>Look where we are today. We still don&#8217;t participate with non-orthodox Jews. In fact the <a href="http://matzav.com/the-rca-and-the-women-of-the-wall" target="_blank">Yated recently addressed this very issue</a>, going so far as to compare Reform Jews in the mid-20th century with the Women of the Wall and MK Lipman. The Yated takes for granted that it would be prohibited to work together with Reform Jews, the additional point was that this rule would also apply to WoW and Lipman. In 1966 Rabbi Spero was hopeful that orthodox Jews could participate with non-orthodox Jews. Here we stand in 2013 and orthodox Jews cannot participate with orthodox Jews who associate with non-orthodox Jews! It seems to me we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>What will it take to change the tenor of discourse in the orthodox Jewish community? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe an Asifa. An <em>achdus</em> Asifa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Quill_Pen_graphic_for_web_t670.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7003" alt="Quill_Pen_graphic_for_web_t670" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Quill_Pen_graphic_for_web_t670-300x188.jpg" width="300" height="188" /></a>The Yated published its first edition since last week&#8217;s hit job on R&#8217; Gil Student and R&#8217; Harry Maryles. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/19/the-difference-between-hirhurim-and-the-yated-a-defense-of-r-gil-student/">The Difference Between Hirhurim and the Yated: A Defense of R’ Gil Student</a>) I am positive that they were barraged with letters to the editor. Some of them were sent to me so I know for certain that they were written.</p>
<p>They published one letter to the editor. It was from R&#8217; Gil Student. That&#8217;s it. His letter was respectful and polite. He also asked for an apology. Then they published a rebuttal from Avrohom Birnbaum who wrote the original article. In his rebuttal Birnbaum demonstrates an incredible ability to be obtuse. He doesn&#8217;t understand why his article was so wrong and doubles down on his unwarranted criticism.</p>
<p>A link to the letters is at the bottom of this post. Don&#8217;t miss the letter from Mrs. Herzog on a completely different topic.</p>
<p>The Yated should have published some more letters supporting R&#8217; Gil and R&#8217; Harry. They did not. So we take to the Internet where we are free to publish whatever we please.</p>
<p>I present a letter to the editor written by <strong>Simcha Schonfeld</strong> who has been published in the letters to the editor section of the Yated several times in the past.</p>
<p><span id="more-7002"></span><br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>An article penned by Avrohom Birnbaum appeared in last week&#8217;s edition that troubled me most deeply. In his piece entitled &#8220;The Broyde Affair and the Media Double Standard&#8221;, Mr. Birnbaum attacked Rabbi Gil Student and his blog Hirhurim for a manufactured series of misdeeds that are more the products of Mr. Birnbaum&#8217;s imagination than they are based in any objective reality. Birnbaum began his attempt at character assassination by accusing Rabbi Student and his website of being &#8220;controversial&#8221; and guilty of &#8220;chareidi smashing&#8221; though in a departure from good and accepted journalistic practices, he offered no evidence to support such incredible accusations. In fact, Rabbi Student is a respected and gentle talmud chacham whose entire essence lacks even a single cell of disrespect for any torah authority, regardless of the hat they wear &#8211; including those who wear black ones, like Rabbi Student himself. He has often taken other bloggers to task for doing exactly what Mr. Birnbaum accused him of. What&#8217;s more, Hihurim (<a href="http://torahmusings.com/">TorahMusings.com</a>) is a <em>chashuv makom torah</em>, an oasis of <em>halacha</em> and <em>machshava</em> on the web that has actually spawned seforim comprised entirely of posts appearing there. One such sefer was given to me as a gift by my (dare I say Chareidi) father. Since Mr. Birnbaum elected to offer no basis for the serious accusations he made, I invite your readers to view the website itself and reach their own conclusions.</p>
<p>I was further puzzled by level of vitriol that Birnbaum used in attacking Rabbi Student for having the perceived gall to decline to answer some of the Yated&#8217;s questions. I do not know who asked the six questions referenced in the piece and am unfamiliar with that individual&#8217;s educational background and journalistic training; however, I could only assume that his/her mentors would have been dissatisfied with the profoundly unprofessional, unnecessarily provocative and outright childish manner in which Rabbi Student was challenged. The questions that Rabbi Student declined to offer comments on included such crass phraseology as accusing Rabbi Student of being a &#8220;mouthpiece&#8221; of &#8220;an outright liar and an ethically tainted individual&#8221; and asked, rhetorically, whether Rabbi Student believed he owed an &#8220;apology&#8221; to his readership. Regardless of what one may think of Michael Broyde, there is a way to communicate in life and there are standards of professionalism in journalism. Those were not adhered to by the author of these intentionally loaded questions that conveyed clear hostility and disrespect more than any earnest desire to know. In response to the Yated&#8217;s adolescent style of questioning, Rabbi Student appropriately took the high road and offered no response at all. Sadly, as Mr. Birnbaum&#8217;s article demonstrates, the high road is all too often the road less traveled.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6971" alt="part 2_1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/part-2_1-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />In the secular world, the print media is losing to digital media. Newspapers are being replaced by websites and journalists are being replaced with bloggers. Apparently the same thing is happening in the charedi world. The print media is losing to the bloggers.</p>
<p>The Yated Ne&#8217;eman has attacked blogs in the past but this week&#8217;s paper has a full page article attacking two specific blogs, Hirhurim and Emes V&#8217;Emunah.</p>
<p>In their article, Avraham Birnbaum manages to write a couple thousand words without saying anything of substance.</p>
<p>The entire premise of the article hinges on the presumption that the Hirhurim community and R&#8217; Gil Student use his blog to attack charedim on a regular basis. Birnbaum portrays Hirhurim as a <em>moshav leitzim</em> of constant charedi bashing.<span id="more-6970"></span></p>
<p>The reader has no way of knowing if this true or not seeing as Birnbaum does not cite a single example or offer a shred of proof for his salacious claims. It&#8217;s one thing to criticize a blog, it&#8217;s another to criticize a blog for something without any support. I went back and did some research. I looked at several weeks of blog posts on Hirhurim. It&#8217;s not so much that Hirhurim bashes charedim, it&#8217;s more like Hirhurim completely ignores charedim. I know that it does not feel especially good to be ignored,  but being ignored is hardly akin to bashing.</p>
<p>In fact, in my experience, there is no blog that promotes respectful discourse more than Hirhurim. The posts are scholarly, thoughtful, substantive, and respectful. If there was a blog that should be acceptable to charedim, it should be Hirhurim!</p>
<p>The Yated reached out to R&#8217; Gil for comment. R&#8217; Gil politely declined to answer the six questions they asked him in an email. The only other experience R&#8217; Gil has had with the Yated has been negative. It serves R&#8217; Gil no purpose to provide soundbites to the Yated. Further, R&#8217; Gil and R&#8217; Michael Broyde are friends. There is no reason for R&#8217; Gil to incriminate his friend in the pages of the Yated.</p>
<p>But the Yated is a scorned mistress. Birnbaum presents R&#8217; Gil&#8217;s polite &#8220;no comment&#8221; as a severe crime. His argument is the classic fallacious argument of  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10101483653832655" target="_blank">what I call the worst argument ever</a>: <em>&#8220;You are doing A in response to B. I think if it was X you would do Y. WHY ARE YOU NOT DOING Y?&#8221;</em> Birnbaum posits that if a charedi leader was involved in a scandal like R&#8217; Broyde&#8217;s R&#8217; Gil would be savoring every moment of it. But here R&#8217; Gil is silent. This is somehow unacceptable.</p>
<p>The Yated expects a response from R&#8217; Gil because of several assumptions. Then they turn a &#8220;no comment&#8221; into a terrible crime. As if anyone who reads the Yated read Orwell, Birnbaum invokes &#8220;a<em>ll animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal</em>&#8220;. Invoking Orwell because R&#8217; Gil said &#8220;no comment&#8221;?  This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Birnbaum claims that the Jewish Week and the Forward were hardly able to contain their glee in their reporting of the scandal. I didn&#8217;t notice that at all. But I might reconsider my position if there was a shred of evidence in the article to support this claim. None is provided.</p>
<p>I do submit that Birnbaum&#8217;s characterization of Emes V&#8217;Emunah is less strident and more accurate. Perhaps he just has an axe to grind with Hirhurim, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Birnbaum is incredibly preachy and condescending. But that wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if his article was rooted in fact. Unfortunately it is not. He just sounds like a child who didn&#8217;t get what he wanted so he stomps his feet loudly in the hope that someone will listen.</p>
<p>To me, this article represents everything wrong with lazy orthodox Judaism. The reader is expected to rely on the writer without evidence. The reader will likely take Birnbaum&#8217;s word for everything he says simply because he is published in the Yated and R&#8217; Gil is published on an unholy blog. I doubt any of the Yated readers will check Hirhurim for themselves to see if the levied criticisms are accurate. At the very least, Birnbaum could have suggested readers do their own investigation and come to their own conclusion.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the way of the Yated or its readers. It is the paper for people who want other people to do their thinking for them. The Yated culture does not encourage critical thinking or challenging the status quo. Hirhurim does. That is the real story here. Aside from the print media vs. the digital media war, there is a more fundamental battle taking place here. Hirhurim represents critical thinking and the Yated represents blind faith in authority. One Hirhurim post has more footnotes than every edition of the Yated ever printed. Hirhurim invites open discussion. The Yated only prints things that are absolutely consistent with their ideology. That&#8217;s the real issue here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close with three points in summary:</p>
<p>1) The Yated should be ashamed of this article for its complete mischaracterization of Hirhurim without evidence.<br />
2) R&#8217; Gil has no obligation to talk to the Yated, especially about a friend.<br />
3) The Yated and Hirhurim operate as polar opposites with regard to independent research vs. appeal to authority.</p>

<p><em>Full disclosure: My esteemed father writes a weekly dvar Torah column for the Yated and is the voice of reason (obviously) on their Chinuch Roundtable.</em></p>
