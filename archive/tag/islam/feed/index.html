				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pew Research Center released their recent study, and the results paint a bleak picture of our religious future in America. It is clear: God’s poll numbers are down across the board, and especially among Millennials. Immediately, frantic media headlines prophesied the end of religion as we know it.</p>
<p>Is this fate? Are we destined to live in a non-religious world? I don’t think we are doomed, unless we keep doing the same things we are doing now. If we want to reverse the trend, we need to reverse course. Suggesting change in religious circles is often taboo. It reminds me of one of my father’s oft repeated (aren’t they all?) jokes. <em>How many Ultra-Orthodox rabbis does it take to change a lightbulb?</em> [beat] <em>Change?!</em><br />
<span id="more-9356"></span></p>
<p>We believers think God gave us our religions. They are not ours to be tinkered and toyed with on a whim.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/07/13/religion-is-dead-long-live-religion/sf/" rel="attachment wp-att-9357"><img class="alignright wp-image-9357 size-thumbnail" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sf.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="sf" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Thus, many believers exclaim that people are abandoning religion because we have become too flexible, too apologetic, too concerned with popular opinion and trends. Their solution is fundamentalism, as it was for the Puritans after the Renaissance, premillennial dispensationalists after Darwin, and Evangelicals in the 80’s after the sexual revolution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, post-modern fundamentalists are making a fundamental mistake. Most Millennials will never be fundamentalists. Above all, they reject the idea that there is only one universal truth. Where hippies rejected authority on principle, Millennials reject appeals to authority because there is no such thing as an authority of ideas. For my entire lifetime of active learning, I’ve been able to fact check anything asserted by an authority as fact. I have never needed to trust authority or rely on the opinions of one person. Self-guided research, diversity, and subjectivity are native to the Millennial generation.</p>
<p>When presented with fundamentalist ideas, we don’t find the “all or nothing” packages attractive. Some of the ideas that are preached by fundamentalists have merit, but that does not translate into adopting fundamentalism. It did in the 80’s. Evangelical Christianity and the Jewish “returnee” movement were massive movements that took hold in the 80’s, and both remain in their own shadows from that time. More fundamentalism is not the answer. In fact, it&#8217;s part of the problem.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the non-fundamentalist option has been to change. When the rules get tough, change the rules. If some of the theology is at odds with modern ideals, just rewrite it. By drawing a target around the arrow after it is lodged in the tree, liberal religious groups can make participation effortless and guiltless. The appeal of change is that is promises everything, but the reality is that this sort of change completely undermines religion.</p>
<p>Millennials flock to authentic experiences. Burning Man is a perfect example of this.  A Burning Man experience is powerful, unique, and above all, authentic.  Similarly, artisanal foods are quintessentially Millennial. No Millennial is trading fine French cuisine for a Big Mac. We want the real thing. We want meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>A counterfeit religious experience is no religious experience at all. It might keep families together at church and synagogue for a few more years, but without authenticity and engagement, nothing will connect Millennials to the experience. It’s hollow. When the structural shell is removed, nothing remains.</p>
<p>But all is not lost. I think there is an alternative approach that respects tradition, does not compromise authenticity, and works for Millennials. The first part of my proposal is that religion is actually a collection of beliefs and practices which ask us to struggle in the tension they create. There is beauty in tension. Ambiguity and doubt are key ingredients to great art. Poetry, music, theater, visual arts, culinary arts, love, and beauty are all ambiguous. They are all open to interpretation, and they all ask us to insert our struggles into the space they create for creative understanding.</p>
<p>We must stop preaching certainty and begin preaching doubt and struggle. Find beauty in the tension, instead of satisfaction in certainty. Religious leaders must be honest, and publicly acknowledge their own struggles and doubts. Instead of occupying the space of certainty that is anathema to Millennials, religion must occupy the space of subjectivity, ambiguity, and struggle. Religion is not the answer to life’s questions. Religion is the tool for exploring the big questions.</p>
<p>We can tolerate mistakes, difficult challenges, unanswered questions, and tension between tradition and modernity. We will not tolerate platitudes, over-confidence, false bravado, and apologetics. Be honest. Acknowledge the problems. Admit your own struggles. Then, invite the Millennials in your life to join you for an authentic experience of engaging with life’s struggles through the lens of religion. The Biblical heroes were flawed and they struggled. Let’s emphasize those stories and animate those Bible passages in our teachings.</p>
<p>The second part of my proposal is found in the tension between nostalgia and relevance. So much of our religious instruction and experience is nostalgic. We try to recapture something magical from our childhood, or a latent memory from a place and time that tugs at us. Millennials love nostalgia, and it’s a valuable tool when, but religion cannot subsist on nostalgia alone.</p>
<p>Our world is so different from the world of our Biblical heroes. Our lives are virtually nothing like the lives of the centuries of interpreters and teachers of religion. We must continue to lean on the eternal teaching they have bequeathed to us, but their teachings felt contemporary to their direct audiences. When we retell their teachings, they may feel nostalgic at best and irrelevant at worst. We must continue to write and create teachings that resonate with us and tell our story.</p>
<p>The Bible is an incredible canvas. Religious texts offer innumerable opportunities for modern interpretation. Not the kind that strips religion of its precepts, rather, the sort of modern interpretations that bring ancient teachings to life. When we explain our rituals, we must choose explanations that add meaning to our lives today. Take ownership of our religions. We can&#8217;t expect Millennials to be spectators of their religion. Millennials want to participate with mind, spirit, soul, and body. Relevance is key to hooking religion to our lives, and not merely relegating our traditions to museums and mausoleums.</p>
<p>I believe in God. I believe in religion. I believe in Millennials. This is fixable problem. Let’s fix it. Acknowledge our struggles. Live in the tension. Make religion relevant with new and modern interpretation. Live a life infused with religious meaning. When the results of the next Pew report on religion in America are released, we can shock the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6987" alt="bill-maher" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bill-maher.jpg?resize=250%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" />A lot of people are very excited that uber-liberal Bill Maher has nasty things to say about Islam. Maher&#8217;s premise is that Islam is the <em>most</em> violent religion today by far and therefore it is unreasonable to raise the argument that religious extremism exists in other religions.</p>
<p>The joke Maher uses to make his point is that he wonders (and this is not his joke) if there could be a &#8220;Book of Islam&#8221; on Broadway like there is a Book of Mormon on Broadway. Maher is correct that a Book of Islam show would probably incite people.</p>
<p>To make this argument work the parameters must be equal. In fact, a plain reading of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/22/a-secular-explanation-for-terrorism/" target="_blank">my post from yesterday </a>is a direct rebuttal of Maher&#8217;s point. If there were 1.6 billion or 2.2 billion (whatever the actual numbers are) Mormons living in developing countries, under oppressive regimes, with poor education, and little chance for freedom or financial success, I am fairly certain that you would have violent, Jihad-like Mormons.<span id="more-6986"></span></p>
<p>The same goes for Jews, Christians, or whomever. People living under those conditions will have a greater propensity towards violence and anti-social behavior. It spans all religions, creeds, and time.</p>
<p>We have senseless systematic violence all over the world. It usually comes back to these same factors.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the point here. There are more dispositive factors in deciphering why certain people turn to violence and others do not. Ignoring factors that are universal and pointing to factors that are theological and specific to one group is a fair argument, but it&#8217;s not the only argument and probably not the best argument.</p>
<p>Why did Christians go on Crusades every few years a few centuries ago? For the same reasons. And so when we say &#8220;look at Christian violence from history&#8221; we are not saying that Christianity is <em>also </em>a &#8220;violent religion&#8221; we are saying that the factors that made Christianity seem violent throughout history are the same factors that make Islam seem violent today. But eliminating those factors is the best way to fix the problem not blaming religion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Maher&#8217;s cute joke is a red herring and that&#8217;s why I still maintain my position that there are much more fundamental factors that create an environment conducive to senseless violence than a book.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Bill Maher dismissing a Professor of Hate and Extremism:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6981" alt="stop-terrorism" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stop-terrorism.jpg?resize=300%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" />Americans are still reeling from a terror attack in Boston last week. The bombers have been identified through fairly conclusive evidence and one is in custody while the other is dead. They were immigrants from war torn Chechnya and they practiced Islam.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the word. Whenever we hear about a violent crime, or regional violence and we hear the word Islam, there is a tendency to presume that the violence is <em>because </em>of Islam. Part of this is because many violent Muslims claim to be acting for the sake of Allah or Jihad. Also, there are a large number of verses in the Quran and Hadith that seem to promote violence and so outsiders can connect the dots and attribute the violence to religion.</p>
<p>Our minds yearn for simple answers to explain complicated things. We want one answer for everything. Our brains are wired with this built-in laziness. It is the same laziness that creates and perpetuates stereotypes through selection bias. It&#8217;s just easier for our brains to make everything simple, and so we try. I submit that my blog post is <em>also</em> an oversimplification. But it is an alternative explanation that does away with bigotry and racism. For that reason alone I think it is worth considering.</p>
<p>For the sake of this post we are going to assume that there is more violence in Arab Muslim countries and that Arab Muslims commit more acts of terror than other groups. <strong>NOTE: I believe these assumptions can be rebutted. However my point will stand even if these assumptions are conceded. Maybe another time we will discuss these presumptions.</strong></p>
<p><em>If you are going to comment on this post here or on Facebook, or wherever, I ask that you please address the arguments and stick to facts instead of just calling people names. Thank you.</p>
<p><span id="more-6980"></span></p>
<p></em></p>
<p>In the USA there are about 40 murders every day. Over 14,000 people are senselessly killed in our country every year. The top countries on a list of the rate of intentional deaths around the world is dominated by non-Arab Muslim countries. Death is everywhere. Violence is everywhere. It&#8217;s not an Arab Muslim phenomena.</p>
<p>Why do people kill? What are the factors that create the social circumstances ripe for murder and death?</p>
<p>I think the first thing we need to do is distinguish between isolated murders and systematic killing. [By systematic killing we don&#8217;t mean genocide. That is a government systematically killing people. We are talking about subcultures where killing is part of normal life.] In the USA many homicides are part of systematic killing cycles. Gang wars, drug cartel and mafia killings are a very large percentage of USA homicides. These are not isolated killings, they are part of a culture of killing and death. We are going to ignore isolated murders because terrorism fits more neatly into the latter category.</p>
<p>In the parts of the USA that we find systematic killing, specifically street gangs and to a lesser extent organized crime I think you&#8217;ll find that their social environments provide very few escape hatches. One is born into a neighborhood or a family and that becomes that person&#8217;s identity. It is very hard to break free from the default positions we are born into. Even more so for those with few economic prospects on the outside. Inevitably, education is shunned and it becomes even more difficult to leave.</p>
<p>People living in those conditions don&#8217;t have as much to live for as the rest of us. We view the world through a lens of opportunity, they view it through a lens of oppression. Their violent way of life is not excusable. It is destructive and they are culpable for their bad choices, but we can understand that their struggle is quite different than the white middle class American&#8217;s struggle.</p>
<p>These are the conditions that are ripe for violence: Little hope of improving one&#8217;s situation, a culture where violence is mistaken for bravery, where education is not valued and hard to come by, and primitive views of &#8220;might is right&#8221; prevail. This is what our gang culture looks like in the USA.</p>
<p>It also happens to be what the world of many Arab Muslims in developing countries looks like.</p>
<p>Another example. In apartheid South Africa, there was a lot of black on white violence. I am not excusing the violence. However, it is obvious to us in hindsight that an oppressed group of people with the same conditions that are present in gang culture would resort to violence. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain. These are the conditions ripe for death and violence.</p>
<p>A third example. Before terrorism we had the Cold War. The enemy was Communism and its violent fanatics. I think we can draw similar parallels to Communist violence as well. People had nothing to lose and everything to gain by being violent. It takes a long time to change that mindset. As it stands today, Russia still has a high homicide rate (more than double the rate in the USA). The conditions have not changed enough in the last few decades to give people the hope and opportunity to succeed. Violence is still rampant.</p>
<p>While it is true that all Arab Muslim terrorists read the Quran and may even claim to be acting for the sake of Allah, those are not necessarily the reasons the terrorists among them act violently. It is more reasonable to assume that they systematically kill for the same reason that other people kill. It is a much more elegant explanation.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that once a person is set upon a path of violence they will use whatever justification that they can find. Arab Muslims will use the Quran, gang members will use the &#8220;Code&#8221;, blacks suffering from apartheid will use the struggle for freedom, Cold War Communists will use the &#8220;Mother Country&#8221; as their justifications. The ideologies may or may not be corrupt or wrong, but to people seeking an escape they provide the after-the-fact justification. In other words, even if the Quran was as genteel as Confucius, people living under these conditions would likely turn to violence anyway.</p>
<p>At this point, we don&#8217;t know the motivations of Boston Bombers. However, just because they are Muslim and killers does not mean that they killed because of their Muslim faith. There are many other reasons that people kill and there is a strong correlation between all systematic killings that spans the racial and religious gamut. I know that Glenn Beck could probably explain how Communism and Gangs and apartheid Blacks are all really using the same ideology as Islam, but we are trying to have a mature conversation about this issue.</p>
<p>Further, even if they claim that they acted on behalf of their religious beliefs, this is not an indictment of Islam. Anything can be used as justification for death. It is only an indictment of their flawed justification. And if we are looking for an explanation, stopping with &#8220;The Quran&#8221; is lazy, and in all likelihood very, very wrong.</p>
<p>The next level of this discussion is that it is wrong to profile all Arab Muslims the same way it would be wrong to profile all poor people with inferior education. Yes, many terrorists are Arab Muslims but by focusing on that one point and ignoring the rest of their social conditions is too lazy and too unfair. If we eliminated Islam from the world people would just use a different justification for their violence. Murder does not require religion or ideology. But systematic killing can usually be traced to a combination of factors that transcend religion.</p>
<p>Our collective energies are more wisely targeted if we can help remove the barriers to education and financial success in the communities where violence is so prevalent. Whether it&#8217;s on the South Side of Chicago, Watts in Los Angeles, East Baltimore, Cairo, or some remote village in Chechnya we can do more to eliminate the social ills that make violence and terrorism possible. We need to give them the tools they need to succeed. Most of all we need to give them hope.</p>

<p>The best book I read this year was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists: A Non-believer&#8217;s Guide to the Uses of Religion</a> by Alain de Botton. The author is a Jewish atheist and apparently a direct descendant of the author of the Lechem Mishnah commentary on Maimonides&#8217; Mishnah Torah. The book is excellent and I highly recommend that everyone read it.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the book is written for atheists. I think believers should read this book at least as much as atheists should read it. The book tries to show that there is a lot that atheists can learn from religion. Generally speaking, de Botton argues that even if religion is  complete bunk there is a reason it developed, evolved, and flourishes. There are evolutionary needs that religion addresses. Religion serves a very important role in the scheme of man&#8217;s existence and when people abandon religion as atheists, they risk losing the very important evolutionary benefits of religion.</p>
<p>In other words, atheists cannot abandon the principles of religion simply because they disbelieve in God. In fact, it almost makes no sense to do that. An atheist must believe that religion evolved as a response to a human need because the atheists does not believe that religion could possibly be a revelation from God since God does not exist according to the atheist! It follows that according to atheists, religion is a human response to some innate needs and its development and success are vital to the success and progress of humanity. Excising religion from the human experience may be necessary for the atheist, but it is fraught with risks. There are elements of religion that are necessary for human development and without religion, those needs may not be met.<span id="more-6667"></span></p>
<p>So the book then goes on to describe some of the humanistic benefits of various religions. Most of the focus is on Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. I found the references to Judaism very fascinating and enlightening. The author even uses some of the harshest victims of atheistic criticism as examples of worthy ideas that should be emulated. For example, he uses mikvah, (yes mikvah!), as an example of attaching ritual and meaning to washing. He says that there is something valuable in attaching bathing to renewal and associating outer washing with inner purity. As orthodox Jews, we may scoff at this humanistic approach to mikvah and it may not be sufficient to allay some of the discomfort that some orthodox Jewish women have with mikvah, but it is refreshing to see a non-believer try to find beauty and meaning in this practice.</p>
<p>Another great example in the book is his section on forgiveness. Yom Kippur is an ingenious way of reconnecting people. It is a day where we are forced to reconcile with our past. Non-believers need such a day as well.</p>
<p>Most importantly, religion creates community and responsibility toward one another. The book mentions Jewish weddings and Bar Mitzvah celebrations as important rituals within a community that should be emulated by non-believers.</p>
<p>The follow up point to each example is that atheists must create analogous practices and rituals for their lives in order to satisfy their needs that are not being met by the absence of religion in their lives. The book proposes cathedrals for atheists, yearly celebrations of bounty, and other corollaries to religious practices for atheists. The proposals are fantastic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mostly theoretical book because I don&#8217;t see how any of this would every come into being. But if it would happen, I think it would be great for society.</p>
<p>Although the book is written for atheists, I think there is something important here for believers as well. We need to appreciate the depth and beauty of our religious practices. We need to see how to a non-believer many of our practices are useful even if God did not exist. To us, who believe God does exist, the benefits of religion are even greater. We need to appreciate how incredibly useful our religion is to our psyche and wellbeing and we need to thank God for giving us such a wonderful way of life to satisfy those needs. This is the true value of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> to the believer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not recommending orthopraxy. I am suggesting that the believer take into account all that religion does for the believer in a religious but also in a secular, psychological, and evolutionary way. We need to realize that what we are doing was given to us by God and it goes beyond just ritual or Divine command that has no non-religious benefit. We should acknowledge and explore the potential humanistic reasons for practicing orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The book also can serve as a bit of a bridge between atheists and believers. It gives us common ground and serves as an antidote to the Dawkins inspired derision of religion. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to see a debate between Dawkins and de Botton. I also wish the Chief Rabbi would have read this book and incorporated some of its lessons in his Op-Ed earlier this week.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> enough. It is a great book for believers and non-believers alike.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/western_religious_symbols.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5278" title="western_religious_symbols" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/western_religious_symbols.jpg?resize=214%2C167" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Remember Tapps? Tapps is the governing body of Texas parochial schools including Beren Academy. A few weeks ago they became a household name after they refused to adjust their tournament schedule out of deference to Beren&#8217;s observance of Shabbos. Everyone from CNN, the NY Times, ESPN, and others reported the story and eventually Tapps acquiesced. Beren played Friday afternoon and won. They moved on to the championship on Saturday night and lost in the final game.</p>
<p>At the time, some people accused Tapps of anti-Semitism. I didn&#8217;t feel like it was anti-Semitism as much as it was myopia and insensitivity to others. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/28/beren-academy-forfeits-tournament-game-because-of-shabbos-and-the-world-reacts/">Beren Academy Forfeits Tournament Game Because of Shabbos and the World Reacts</a>).</p>
<p>The NY Times decided to do a little digging and has made some interesting discoveries. While Tapps may not be anti-Semitic on its face, some new information forces us to reconsider.<span id="more-5277"></span></p>
<p>It seems that not only did Tapps make life difficult for a Jewish school, Beren, but they have made it impossible, if not extremely degrading, for Muslim schools to join Tapps. While their decisions with regard to the Jewish school were ambiguous, their actions toward the Muslim schools can only be described as bigoted.</p>
<p>One school was given the opportunity to be considered for acceptance in Tapps and was asked to fill out a questionnaire. No  non-Muslim schools were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The queries on the questionnaire were also quite offensive. Here are some of the nuggets discovered by NY Times:</p>
<p><em>Historically, there is nothing in the Koran that fully embraces Christianity or Judaism in the way a Christian and/or a Jew understands his religion. Why, then, are you interested in joining an association whose basic beliefs your religion condemns?”</em></p>
<p><em>It is our understanding that the Koran tells you not to mix with (and even eliminate) the infidels. Christians and Jews fall into that category. Why do you wish to join an organization whose membership is in disagreement with your religious beliefs?</em></p>
<p><em>How does your school address certain Christian concepts? (i.e. celebrating Christmas)</em></p>
<p><em>When was the Bible allegedly polluted? Does the Koran actually state that the Bible is polluted?</em></p>
<p><em>What is your attitude about the spread of Islam in America? What are the goals of your school in this regard?</em></p>
<p>The school answered the questionnaire and was still not accepted into Tapps.</p>
<p>Tapps also sent a survey to the other schools asking questions like &#8220;would you leave the association if Muslim schools were included?&#8221;and &#8220;Is it in the best interest of Tapps to accept Islamic schools for membership?&#8221;. The results may be even more disturbing. 67% of respondents felt Muslim schools should not be allowed in Tapps.</p>
<p>There are multiple levels to this. First, Tapps is clearly not a friendly place for non-Christians. They are fervent in their beliefs and the beliefs of others not acceptable to them. They don&#8217;t play on their Sabbath, but refused to acknowledge the Jewish Sabbath. They believe that Muslims and Jews are doomed because they do not accept Jesus. (Generally, Christians really believe this, it says so in the <a href="http://www.openbible.info/topics/non_believers" target="_blank">Bible</a>, just many Christians don&#8217;t act on these beliefs in the public sphere.) But they challenge those same beliefs in others. These beliefs are abhorrent and are not acceptable in 2012. One can, <em>no, one must,</em> be fervently religious without being hateful toward other religions.</p>
<p>I am sure there are some of you who think that the questions asked of Muslims are legitimate. I have a few things to say to you. First of all, this is sports league, not a religious debate league. It should not matter one bit what the beliefs of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are with regard to anything other than the scheduling and executing of the league schedule. The idea that the Muslim schools need to be &#8220;vetted&#8221; just so that they could play in the same league is extremely xenophobic.</p>
<p>Second, a questionnaire is not appropriate even if the league were a debate of religion league. They betray a deeply held prejudice against non-members of Christianity in general and an even deeper prejudice for Islam. These kids are living in Texas, not Saudi Arabia! Obviously their parents are more comfortable in a free country like America than they would be in a fascist country. Further, they are asking to play basketball, a Western game. They just want to be American kids. The questioning is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Third the particular questions are even more inappropriate. All religions condemn other religions. That&#8217;s a fact of religions. Move on. Accept it. The Christmas question is hilarious. Christians have asked me with incredulity &#8220;You don&#8217;t celebrate Christmas?!&#8221;. That&#8217;s right. Non-Christians don&#8217;t celebrate Christmas. Why is this an issue? The question that gives it all away is the last one. The &#8220;spread of Islam&#8221; is an irrational fear that has become a deeply rooted fundamental belief of non-Muslims. American Muslims who I know and talk to about these issues have no such agenda. Sure, there are insane fundamentalists who live in backwards, oppressed countries who want to convert the entire world to Islam. They have nothing to do with normal American Muslims. But thanks to the tireless efforts of heroes like Pam Geller, the average, bigoted, non-thinking, Christian American actually thinks that his religious beliefs are under siege from normal American Muslims. This is hate. Pure and simple.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t really blame Tapps. They are just buying what their heroes are selling. I blame those who are selling it. The best way that I know of eliminating hate is by getting to know one another. When people who are different on the outside get to know each other, preconceived notions are burst and understanding and appreciating can begin. The unfortunate result of Tapps&#8217; bigotry is that it reinforces itself by discouraging their schools from increased interaction with the Muslim students. No interaction means no opportunities to unlearn their bigotry. But perhaps that is what Tapps wanted all along.</p>
<p>Although I was willing to overlook Tapps&#8217; faux pas with regard to Beren as simple-mindedness, I am now changing my opinion and declaring them general bigots towards anyone not of the same religious beliefs as them. In 2012 this is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for Christians in Texas and it is unacceptable for Jews and Muslims as well. We are all part of a global community now. Deal with each other in a civil way or go away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/science1.jpeg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5021" title="science1" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/science1-300x156.jpg?resize=270%2C140" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>We did a family trip to the California Science Center at Exposition Park in Los Angeles yesterday. The museum is nice, albeit a bit outdated. Such is the fate of any museum that has exhibits of the latest and greatest in technology. Cell phones were a new obscure invention according to the exhibit on technology. Even better was the section describing how phone lines are not fast enough for video conferencing. Hehe.</p>
<p>Anyway, the highlights of the museum are the Hubble 3D IMAX movie and the temporary exhibit called 1001 Inventions. The IMAX was incredible. It told the story of the Hubble telescope and some of its most incredible discoveries. It was really powerful to see the beauty and seeming infinite scope of outer space. The 3D images of galaxies and galaxy clusters trillions of light years away is awe-inspiring. The 3D glasses, 9 story screen and excellent sound system make you feel like you are traveling through space. Simply remarkable.</p>
<p>1001 Inventions is an international project that demonstrates some of the technological marvels and advances contributed by the Arab world in the Middle Ages. In a time that is stereotyped as the Dark Ages in Europe, much &#8220;light&#8221; was found in Arab countries. Hundreds of ideas and inventions are part of the exhibit. It is modern and compelling and I really enjoyed it.<span id="more-5017"></span></p>
<p>Socially, the exhibit attracted many Muslims and I found pleasure and inspiration exploring the exhibit side by side with devout Muslims.</p>
<p>Politically, I can anticipate that there are those who will object to the exhibit simply because it portrays Islam in a favorable light. It has become en vogue for social conservatives and progressives to battle over the imagery of Islam in America. Some people find it harmful that Islam be portrayed as peaceful or beneficial to society. Others bend over backwards to ignore Islamic extremism and oppression in Arab countries. I don&#8217;t think either of those approaches are wise or prudent, but that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>When examining the exhibit through those lenses I think the exhibit was fair. It only spoke to technology and medicine and the scholarship within the Arab word during the Middle Ages. I think this is an message for Arabs and non-Arabs in 2012. It is important for non-Arabs because it reminds them (or informs them) that there is a rich history of wisdom and forward thinking in the Arab world. We need to be thankful for their contributions to society. It is important for Arabs because in its current iteration, it seems as thought the Arab community is mired in backwards thinking. Technology and progress are not priorities. Thinking and scholarship are not priorities either. Advances are not coming from the Arab world at the same rate as they come from Asia, Europe or America. It would be great if this exhibit inspired a return to scholarship and innovation that contributes to the good of the world community. With such a rich history, I would imagine reinvigorating efforts for progress would be natural.</p>
<p>The second take-away from the exhibit that I had was that it tried to show that relations between members of different religions were not always contentious. The best proof of this was the only non-Muslim or Arab with a prominent place in the exhibit. That would be the Maimonides display:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_04561.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5019 aligncenter" title="IMG_0456" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_04561-e1326132152413-768x1024.jpg?resize=592%2C789" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I found the description of Maimonides fair and positive. It might be a bit understated though. I think Maimonides was even more of an iconoclast than he is given credit for in the panel. A video accompanied this panel and went a bit more in depth than the panel. In general, I was very pleased that Maimonides was included in the exhibit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am sure that some will find nefarious intentions in his inclusions. Something along the lines of the &#8220;Muslims are stealing Maimonides&#8221; or something like that. But I think that is misguided and wrong. The text clearly says that he was a Jewish doctor. Most importantly, the text notes that he helped people of all faiths. Indeed, this is one of the legacies of Maimonides.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The exhibit is worth seeing if you are in LA or one of the other locations. If you have seen it, I am interested in your impressions of the exhibit.</p>

I saw it just after I wrote about the modern day exorcist here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/28/demons-dybbuks-devils-and-exorcism/" target="_blank">Demons, Dybbuks, Devils and Exorcism</a>. Buying this book was a smart decision. I read the book a little while back and neglected to do a review but I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you all about this book since I read it.</p>
<p>The author, J.H Chajes, is a professor at University of Haifa. He is a distant relative of the great Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> is very scholarly and well researched. Yet, it reads like a novel, well almost like a novel, and it kept me engrossed in its content from start to finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> chronicles the rise of recorded incidents of dybbuks and exorcism in the era of mystical writings of the Arizal&#8217;s students. Most of the book takes place in the 16th and 17th centuries. The book traces the relationship between Christian, Muslim and Jewish exorcism legends and practice as well. An appendix has full accounts of exorcisms found in rabbinic literature from that era.</p>
<p>As a skeptic, I found the restraint of Chajes astounding. It is almost as if he is winking the entire time that he is writing about demonic / disembodied soul possession. You just know that he can&#8217;t believe what he is writing as fact is even possible. But he writes as an objective 3rd party about rabbis and others performing exorcisms with a straight face.</p>
<p>There are a few points that I took away from the book that are worth sharing.<span id="more-4968"></span> First of all, the book mentions some disputes between rabbis. They were vicious disagreements. Accusations of philandering, abject immorality and horrible insults are hurled the way of one particular rabbi. I can only imagine what our rabbinic disputes will look like to historians some time in the future. Fascinating to read and fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>Second, the book supports the theory that &#8220;the more knowledge becomes accessible, the more some religious leaders will try to &#8216;esotericize&#8217; their religion to maintain a level of separation between the masses and the public&#8221;. I know, that theory is a mouthful. With regard to exorcism it works as follows. The masses were becoming more literate throughout the world. Exorcism was an art reserved for spiritual leaders and scholars. It was not available to the masses no matter how learned they became. Thus, the existence of demons and dybbuks reinforced the need for leadership. It is similar to today&#8217;s maximalist position of Daas Torah. In a time that more orthodox Jews can study the sources and responsa on a given subject, the religious leaders have reserved a segment of inaccessible knowledge under the maximalist position of Daas Torah. I&#8217;m not saying this is wrong or intentional, rather it is a pattern and it happens.</p>
<p>My third point for this review is the nature of the relationship between Jewish scholars and their Christian and Muslim counterparts. It seems that there was much interaction between them and they worked together, at least for the sake of exorcism. It was nice to see cooperation instead of the stereotypical debates and polemics against one another. If they could do it, so could we.</p>
<p>If you have ANY interest in dybbuks or demons or exorcism or 16th century mysticism, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20071121-first-thanksgiving.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4873" title="20071121-first-thanksgiving" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20071121-first-thanksgiving.png?resize=300%2C252" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>You might find it odd that the day after Thanksgiving I am writing about Thanksgiving. The truth is that I am not really writing about Thanksgiving rather some of the nutty things that happened this year on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Of course I am talking about some the controversies that arose regarding the celebrations of Thanksgiving that don&#8217;t fit the mold of the religious Christian Thanksgiving. Two incidents in particular created some buzz but I am sure there were others as well.</p>
<p>First we turn to the Butterball Turkey situation. One blogger called upon her readers to boycott Butterball because they dared to have their Turkeys Halal certified. This means that it is slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law. It is very similar to Shechita, the method of slaughter required by Jewish law. According to Ms. Geller:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Halal turkey, slaughtered according to the rules of Islamic law, is just the opposite of what Thanksgiving represents: freedom and inclusiveness, neither of which are allowed for under that same Islamic law.&#8221;<span id="more-4872"></span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, Thanksgiving DOES NOT represent freedom or inclusiveness. It never has and never will. I can provide Ms. Geller with a hint as to what the holiday represents &#8211; it&#8217;s in the name. Oh yes. It&#8217;s thanks and appreciation.</p>
<p>More importantly, any religious ceremony is by default not free or inclusive. Jewish law, Canon law, Islamic law, any religious law that makes specific requirements is not (on the surface) &#8220;freedom&#8221;. They are restrictions. Moreover, religious law is never going to be inclusive. It calls for rituals that make the performer of the ritual a religious person and by default the one who does not perform the ritual irreligious. This can create a barrier between the religious and irreligious. All religions suffer this potential flaw.</p>
<p>Just look at my Tim Tebow post from a couple days ago: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/23/tim-tebows-relationship-with-his-god/">Tim Tebow’s Relationship With His God</a>. Not everyone is so comfortable with Tebow&#8217;s religious proclivities. But have a look at the comment left by the Christian fellow in the comments. Do you think his religion is &#8220;inclusive&#8221; of me? (Or Ms. Geller?) Is that the sound of freedom? In Ms. Geller&#8217;s world that makes Tebow the commenter people who should not allowed to celebrate Thanksgiving. They are not inclusive enough.</p>
<p>Ms. Geller calls Halal slaughtering a form of torture. This is obviously offensive to all kosher eating people as well.</p>
<p>But the real point is that Ms. Geller is being as two-faced as one can be. By denying an entire group the right to have a Thanksgiving dinner, Ms. Geller is being as freedom hating and non-inclusive as one can be. But that was obvious.</p>
<p>Finally, I imagine that the reason Butterball markets Halal turkeys is because it is good business. To me, that&#8217;s just the free market that Ms. Geller loves so much.</p>
<p>Now we turn to controversy number two. The President gave the traditional Presidential Thanksgiving address and neglected to mention God in his words. The president dedicated this year&#8217;s holiday celebration to the troops fighting our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also thanked the volunteers in soup kitchens across America. So what was the problem? He did not mention God. This is a terrible sin that violates the ancient and holy laws of Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Never mind that in the Presidential Thanksgiving Proclamation he did mention God.</p>
<p>The omission set off a firestorm of vitriol toward the president.</p>
<p>A particularly bombastic twitterer called Obama a &#8220;militant atheist&#8221; for not mentioning God in the address. As irresponsible and insane of a statement it is to &#8220;out&#8221; someone as an atheist when they clearly are not an atheist, the tweet ignores the Proclamation and Obama&#8217;s 2009 and 2010 Thanksgiving addresses where he did mention God.</p>
<p>How is this reconciled? Was he a believer before but now he is all of the sudden a &#8220;militant atheist&#8221;? Or maybe he was a &#8220;militant atheist&#8221; all along but he has finally decided to own up to his true non-beliefs?</p>
<p>As far as militant atheists go, Obama would hardly be very successful. He goes to Church, says the appropriate God Bless Americas and to my knowledge has never engaged a believer in debate trying to convince the believer that belief in God is wrong.</p>
<p>Obama is not an atheist and certainly is not a militant atheist. This the kind of message that someone tweets to pander to right wing conservative Christians and bait left wing liberal non-Christians. It&#8217;s a call for attention. Well, he got it. Congratulations. But at what cost? Credibility. You can only say so many crazy things before everything you say is considered crazy.</p>
<p>All the silliness aside, I think that Thanksgiving is one day that should be enjoyed and celebrated by people of all faiths and people of no faith. That Ms. Geller and the bombastic twitterer feel that Thanksgiving must be celebrated in one way and in no other is a fallacy. Thanksgiving is the perfect time to push aside our differences and be thankful for the wonderful things in our lives to whomever or whatever we attribute them to.</p>
<p>The irony is that both Ms. Geller and the bombastic twitterer are Jewish and that they would prefer a Christian version of the holiday than a non-denominational celebration tells me that they have sold out the ever important freedom of religion and inclusiveness of America&#8217;s Constitution for the sake making friends in religious right.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is for everyone. Let&#8217;s keep it that way.</p>

<p>I have NOT read the book. I have read the interview.</p>
<p>The book is a study of how and why religions became part of the human experience from the perspective of social evolution. The premise is that humans need religion and this spawned religion.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not a perspective that most religious people are going to be comfortable sharing. For religious people, religion came directly from God. Not because of a human need to create religion.</p>
<p>Although, reading the interview made me think about how religions view other contemporary religions to their own and religions that preceded their own. For example, what does Judaism / Christianity / Islam / Buddhism / Hinduism / Native American religions etc. say about how the &#8220;others&#8221; practice. If each religion claims it was revealed by God then what are all those other people doing? Did God give them other instructions? Or did <em>they</em> invent their religions while <em>yours</em> is correct? Where did those religions come from if God only revealed your religion?</p>
<p>Very interesting questions.<span id="more-4524"></span></p>
<p>As for Judaism, Maimonides has a comprehensive approach to explain the existence of religions prior to Abraham and how one served God before the revelation of the Torah.</p>
<p>Briefly, God revealed to Adam some basic commandments but of primary importance was to recognize the existence of a Singular, All Powerful Creator. A few individuals were able to maintain this level of observance. But most people corrupted it and began to focus their attention to things that they viewed as &#8220;powers&#8221; such as the sun, moon, wind etc. Instead of worshipping the Creator they worshipped these &#8220;powers&#8221;. Eventually this gave way to full blown pagan religions.</p>
<p>The only monotheistic religion was the small group of people who followed Adam&#8217;s teachings. Abraham was chosen as the man from whom would grow a people who would teach this system. Eventually this became the Jewish people who got a much more complete set of instructions at Sinai.</p>
<p>Christianity and Islam are clear and direct branches off the Judaism tree.</p>
<p>We are forced to say that other religions either evolved from the original pagans who did not accept the monotheism of Adam / Abraham or that they borrowed ideas from existing Adam / Abraham monotheism. As for their claims that God revealed their religion to them through a prophet and the instructions differ from ours, there are two points. First, there is certainly room for prophecy among non-Jews but it is unlikely that a pagan would be a prophet considering the qualifications. Further, if the prophet contradicted the Torah or the Abrahamic version of monotheism we would be forced to say the prophet is a fraud.</p>
<p>Being part of a global community of religions sometimes means that we need to admit that our traditions are mutually exclusive. I think it is important and worthwhile to analyze how we deal with questions about how other religions were formed. Each religion believes it is the right one. But they cannot ignore the fact that others exist.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the presence of such questions and analyzing their answers does not prove or disprove the validity of religion in general or a specific religion in question.</p>

<p>I relate to many Libertarian views and I read articles that Reason posts on Facebook all the time. The article I read today was so good that I want to share it with all of you.</p>
<p>I am not saying that I agree with everything written in the article. But I am saying that the article very clearly chronicles the mainstreaming of the irrational fear of Islam. Most importantly for orthodox Jews are the sections that compare how halacha (Jewish law) is treated by our secular government and the general public with how Sharia (Islamic law) is treated by our secular government and the general public.</p>
<p>Agree or disagree with the conclusions in the article, the facts are worth knowing and the analysis is worth discussing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/koran2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3957" title="koran2" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/koran2.jpg?resize=300%2C244" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Fox News is reporting, and one of my Facebook friends is bleating, that a &#8220;Florida judge is defending his controversial decision to apply Islamic law instead of state or federal statutes in determining whether an arbitration award was correct&#8221;.</p>
<p>What this means is that a dispute arose between Muslims. It is some lawsuit about trustees on a board of a Mosque. Before the dispute, they agreed to go to &#8220;arbitration&#8221; to settle any future dispute. The arbitrator was to be an Imam and he was to be instructed to use Islamic law to settle the case. They did just that and I guess the losing party decided to give the American legal system a shot. The judge decided that the arbitration was binding and that the parties could not pursue futher litigation in the secular courts.</p>
<p>This is being portrayed as Sharia law creeping into America. For some, it is the confirmation they need that &#8220;the end is near&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fox News calls this a &#8220;controversial decision&#8221;.</p>
<p>Conservatives are pulling their hair out over this.</p>
<p>This makes me afraid.<span id="more-3956"></span></p>
<p>Orthodox Jews use a similar system of arbitration to settle disputes between Orthodox Jews. The Jewish courts apply Jewish law and are held as binding by American courts. The Jewish courts are called Beis Din and their decisions are accepted as binding arbitration by the legal system.</p>
<p>In fact, here is a quote from an Illinois appeal from someone who was excommunicated in Beis Din and sued the Beis Din for intentional infliction of emotional distress:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Plaintiff has aligned himself with this particular Orthodox Jewish community and by doing so has accepted its laws, rules and procedures. One of these laws, of which plaintiff admits he was aware, allows for excommunication where, as here, the Rabbinic Court determines that plaintiff has refused three consecutive summonses to appear before it. Because of plaintiff&#8217;s actions and knowledge of this community&#8217;s rules and practices, the actions of the Rabbinical Court of which plaintiff complains are not so outrageous as to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thomas v. Fuerst 345 Ill.App.3d 929</em></p>
<p>The secular courts are very deferential to the religious courts when the parties have agreed to use a religious court. Jews have experienced this many many times.</p>
<p>Thus, the Florida judge is doing exactly what he is supposed to do. There is no controversy here. This is not Sharia law taking over America. It is the laws of binding arbitration as applied to Islamic Law in nearly the EXACT same way it applies to Jewish Law.</p>
<p>So take a chill pill Fox News and your insane commenters.</p>
<p>Insane commenters like this one:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This judge should be removed from his seat and disbarred!There is n place in America for sharia law!If one wants to be more sharia compliant they need to pack all belongings and move to another country where these clowns are tolerated.THIS I AMERICA comply by OUR rules or get out!</em></p>
<p>Um, hello? The judge is applying American law. Got it?</p>
<p>Fair and balanced?</p>

Hardly something ripped from the headlines. This kind of thing happens all the time. But this time, the Church has come under fire for it&#8217;s friendliness.</p>
<p>The Heartsong Church in Cordova Tennessee (it&#8217;s not named after anything Muslim, calm down) allowed the local Memphis Islamic Center to use its facilities while the Islamic Center was being renovated. Church members feel it is their duty as righteous Christians to open their doors to anyone in need. These Muslims were in need of a decent place to pray and the Church was more than willing to lend a hand.<span id="more-3824"></span></p>
<p>The two groups have a longstanding relationship and share a Thanksgiving meal each year as well. Sounds like a wonderful story to me.</p>
<p>Critics are saying that this is akin to &#8220;sleeping with the enemy&#8221;. In fact (friend of Israel) Mike Huckabee has (half in jest) compared it to showing adult films in a Church. The not in jest part of Huckabee&#8217;s statement was:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“If the purpose of a church is to push forward the gospel of Jesus Christ, and then you have a muslim group that says that Jesus Christ and all the people that follow him are a bunch of infidels who should be essentially obliterated, I have a hard time understanding that.”</em></p>
<p>Well, Mr. Huckabee allow me to explain it to you. (I&#8217;m not saying I believe this. I am saying that a religious Christian would / should believe this.) First of all, maybe the members of the Church are trying to teach the Muslims about charity and love the way Jesus tried to teach those same values to people of all faiths. That seems like a nice way to teach everyone about Jesus. Second of all, these people are friends! They are not trying to obliterate each other. They are neighbors and friends and have an existing relationship!</p>
<p>Look, Huckabee is over reacting. But I think everyone that is ignoring this story is under reacting. I don&#8217;t mean reacting to Huckabee&#8217;s inane comparisons. I mean reacting to supposed enemies getting along just fine.</p>
<p>When people are friends first and religious ideologues second (or not at all), they can be friends no matter what their beliefs. When people see others as people and foster good relationships it is hard to hate them. It&#8217;s a good thing. Isn&#8217;t this the kind of Christianity and Islam that will usher in a new era of peace among all religions?</p>
<p>I think so. And I hope that we will see more interfaith relationships among people of all backgrounds, faiths and political aspirations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3716" title="the-future" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg?resize=300%2C239" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you&#8217;ve known me for a little while you know I am an optimist. If we&#8217;ve talked about the conflict in the Middle East you know I am optimistic about that too.</p>
<p>For a little while now (at least a couple of years) I have maintained that the conflict will in effect, resolve itself, eventually.</p>
<p>Until recently, Gazans and West Bank Palestinians have heard one voice. A voice that told them in categorical terms that their life would be better under autonomous rule by Hamas or the PLO. Palestinians believed them. It created fanatics, fascists and suicide bombers. But people can only be told a lie so long as there is no evidence to the contrary.<span id="more-3710"></span></p>
<p>If someone tells you that the world is flat you know he is lying because you have information that shows him to be lying. Information is king. Therefore, I have contended that my generation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y" target="_blank">Generation Y</a>) is the information generation. My generation does not accept lies or legends at face value. We know there is a way to learn on our own to unmask lies passed off as facts or legends passed off as history. We are the Wikipedia generation. We know that the information is available and we are willing to find it ourselves.</p>
<p>So long as information can be controlled, the public will kneel to authority, corrupt or otherwise. But once information is freely available to the masses, the lies unravel, the legends are exposed and truth can prevail. Authority that told those lies and legends is discarded and the people want truth, a voice and democracy. I have been saying that my generation of Palestinians and Muslims in general who have access to information will undoubtedly prefer to join the West in its freedoms, capitalism and democracy.</p>
<p>When the choices are death or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is easy. When the choice is money, entertainment, enlightenment or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is even easier. With the wave of unbridled information entering the oppressed masses in Arab countries, fundamental fanaticism will be replaced with a thirst for information and the allure of modern civilization. A lifestyle of books and e-books, Facebook and Twitter, Playstation and XBOX, e-commerce and ebay sure as heck beats a Third World existence. This is why my generation will resolve the conflict. Conflict serves no one but the elite and corrupt leaders. It will mean out with oppressive rulers and in with freedom.</p>
<p>The beginnings of this movement has already been formed in Gaza. A few weeks ago the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/02/free-gaza-youth-manifesto-palestinian" target="_blank">Guardian reported</a> on a &#8220;Manifesto&#8221; written by disgruntled Palestinians. They don&#8217;t want Hamas, they don&#8217;t want Fatah, they don&#8217;t want Israel, they want freedom.</p>
<p>What happened in Tunisia and what is happening right now in Egypt is more of the same. The people will not be controlled by corrupt Heads of State who demand allegiance for no reason other than &#8220;I said so&#8221;. The people want their freedom. They want what we have in the West. And they will get it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/28/president-reagans-message-for-protesters-in-egypt/">President Reagan’s Message for the Protesters in Egypt</a>)</p>
<p>A little bit of patience and gentle prodding from the West will help the next generation of Arabs achieve their emancipation. I maintain that 9/11 was a final salvo. The fundamentalist establishment tried one last time to supress the free flow of information by trying to destroy it. They failed and freedom is around the corner.</p>
<p>Just ask the protestors in Tunisia and Egypt.</p>
<p>I do admit that the protests are not without flaws. It is entirely possible that the new leaders will be equally despotic as their predecessors. We can only hope that will not be the case. But even if it is, it won&#8217;t last long. Change is coming. The cat is out of the bag and freedom is like a drug that is addictive and readily available. The public won&#8217;t be satisfied until they can drink the elixir of freedom. And they will.</p>
<p>This phenomena has also affected the orthodox Jewish community. The more information that becomes available, the more the religious leaders are concerned about losing their authority. This is silly. The authority of rabbis was never binding except in a rabbinic court or perhaps via an uncontested responsa. It is a folly of this generation&#8217;s leadership (or its handlers) that asserted this unilateral power. It never existed and yes, with information this imagined power will disappear. This is why the Internet is so feared by these rabbis. That is why the Internet is banned in charedi circles. It is because of the information and free flow of ideas that the Internet provides which in turn minimizes their invented power. Orthodox Judaism does not depend on charismatic or authoritarian rabbis, it depends of individual commitment to Jewish law and theology. Information is a boon to that kind of religious practice. If we are confident in orthodox Judaism as a viable way of life, information must be a friend, not a foe. I know that I am confident, I can&#8217;t say the same for those who cower in fear from information.</p>
<p>The future is now, or coming soon enough. The Internet is giving people a thirst for freedom and independence. Totalitarianism cannot win against the almost infinite amount of information that is easily accessible from a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">device smaller</a> than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoPf98i8A0g" target="_blank">George Costanza&#8217;s wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Say hello to the future.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>

<p>In case you didn&#8217;t know, I have another mini-blog on Tumblr. It&#8217;s called efink&#8217;s tumblrings and you can see it here: <a href="http://efink.tumblr.com/">efink&#8217;s tumblrings</a>. On Tumblr you can follow other Tumblrs. One of the Tumblrers that I follow linked an excellent article by a Muslim Feminist named Mona Eltahawy, called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/article/905569--let-me-a-muslim-feminist-confuse-you" target="_blank">Let Me, a Muslim Feminist, Confuse You.</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s excellent because it is passionate, interesting, well written and important.</p>
<p>I found it very interesting how some of the struggles she encounters and experiences as a progressive Muslim woman reflect similar encounters and experiences within the orthodox Jewish community.<span id="more-3473"></span></p>
<p>She takes a little shot at ultra-Orthodox Jews in this line:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p><em>I moved to Israel, where I was the first Egyptian to live and work there for a western news agency. I became a liberal Muslim because my ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbours reminded me of ultra-orthodox Muslim Saudis. Orthodoxy serves men much more than it does women.</em></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>But, it&#8217;s hard to argue with her perceptions. Although I will say that the predominant levels of oppression that exist within the ultra-Orthodox community are nowhere near the levels of oppression found in hardline, fundamentalist Islamic community.</p>
<p>And as an orthodox Jew it&#8217;s very easy to relate to her struggle. It is worth noting that passionate religious beliefs can be hard to maintain in a modern world. In this respect, Ms. Eltahawy and I are in very similar situations. I am sure there is much that I could learn from her.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, for my orthodox Jewish friends who do not acknowledge the movement within Islam that is progressive and modern this article is exhibit A. Its author is not alone and its author represents the kind of Islam that all Americans should support.</p>

<p><em>Then they came for the Happy Meals and I did not speak up because I don&#8217;t eat happy meals.</em></p>
<p><em>Then they came for those who circumcise their sons and fortunately, there are plenty to speak up.</em></p>
<p>San Francisco is a favorite city of mine. I think I may have to reconsider.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/02/business/la-fi-happy-meals-20101103" target="_blank">Happy Meal ban</a> is dumb, but it doesn&#8217;t discriminate against a particular group. The circumcision ban would present a big problem for a lot of people. San Francisco &#8220;intactivists&#8221; are gathering the requisite signatures to place a circumcision ban on the ballot. If it gets on the ballot and gets enough votes, circumcision would be banned in San Francisco.<span id="more-3316"></span></p>
<p>Judaism and Islam require male circumcision.</p>
<p>The proposed law raises some very interesting constitutional issues. It is very hard to prove discrimination against a religion. So long as there is another purpose for the law, besides discrimination, the law is likely to be upheld and not in violation of the &#8220;Free Exercise&#8221; Clause. If the proponents of the ban can show that there is a legal interest that is being protected by the law then it will likely be upheld.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment protects a parent&#8217;s rights to make decisions for their child without interference from the government. The court has found that there is a Fundamental Right to &#8220;direct a child&#8217;s upbringing&#8221;. The issue here would be if there is a compelling government interest in banning circumcision. I don&#8217;t think the proposed law could withstand this challenge. If the court would not find that circumcision is part of &#8220;the upbringing of a child&#8221;, then the law would have a chance.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on the legal analysis? Lawyers? Law Students? Others?</p>
<p>I can completely understand why someone who is not religious would not want to circumcise their son. I can even understand why they think it is wrong or inappropriate. However, for a person who is religious, their religion is their law and their life. The &#8220;intactivists&#8221; claim that religion is a choice and the baby cannot choose their religion when they are getting circumcised. I think that most children raised in a mildly religious environment with a basic appreciation for their traditions and practicing some of those traditions will be happy to continue in their tradition and would appreciate their parents&#8217; role in helping them be a faithful member of that religion, even if it means circumcision.</p>
<p>The health benefits and detriments are neglible as science has shown. Circumcision is about religion and not about ancient medicine.</p>
<p>As an aside, my father is a Mohel (traditional Jewish &#8220;circumciser&#8221;).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only thing this law would accomplish, even if passed, is that it would force Jews and Muslims who are compelled to circumcise their sons to either move out of San Francisco, or simply have the circumcision performed outside the city limits. Seems pretty silly to me&#8230;</p>

A while ago I wrote about the efforts of Dutch Christians like Corrie Ten Boom who saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust (<a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/2010/03/03/time-with-corrie-ten-boom-review/">Time With Corrie ten Boom | Review</a>). The Holocaust did not affect Jews in Muslim countries nearly as much as it affected Jews in Christian countries. One has to wonder what happened to Jews in Muslim countries.</p>
<p>My friend <strong>Calvin Ngo</strong> sent this item to me.</p>
<p>CNN has linked to an article about this exhibit in a Jewish Temple about Albanian Muslims who felt a kinship with their neighbor Jews and risked their lives to save them.</p>
<p>The quotes are profound and hopeful.<span id="more-3180"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to share the same faith. You have to respect each other&#8217;s faith&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Jews are God&#8217;s people like us&#8221;</p>
<p>and more in the video&#8230;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this the way it is supposed to be? People caring for people?</p>
<p>I am hopeful that this exhibit will remind, Jews, Muslims and everyone else that we can and must coexist in a tolerant society.</p>
<p>Hatred is SO 20th Century&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tolerance.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3169" title="Tolerance" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tolerance.jpg?resize=289%2C289" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In the comment threads that follow the two posts I wrote about Esther Petrack (who has been eliminated from ANTM) (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/16/esther-petrack-modern-orthodox-jewish-girl-on-americas-next-top-model-drops-shabbos-on-television/">Esther Petrack: Modern Orthodox Jewish Girl on America’s Next Top Model Drops Shabbos on Television</a> and <a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/2010/10/19/esther-petracks-mother-speaks-esther-is-observant-it-was-all-editing/">Esther Petrack&#8217;s Mother Speaks: Esther is observant, it was all editing</a>) I noticed something that I feel needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>Much of the conversation was about whether Esther could be considered &#8220;Orthodox&#8221; or &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; in light of her decision to model. The first comment thread assumed that she dropped Shabbos (even though we knew it could be editing and my post was not about her per se) and the second thread assumed that even if she kept Shabbos there was a problem with her modeling.</p>
<p>Quite a few commenters found the need to &#8220;draw a line&#8221; between what they do and what Esther did. Some said she desecrated God&#8217;s name. Others said that violated a law and not being ashamed is enough for them to be ousted from orthodoxy or modern orthodoxy. I debated the merits of those claims on the thread (and even received a number of emails thanking me) and I don&#8217;t care to debate them further.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is this need that has been expressed to self define by whom we exclude.<span id="more-3168"></span></p>
<p>This phenomena is part of what drove the &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; laws of the first half of the 20th century. Sure blacks couldn&#8217;t be used as slaves anymore, but by excluding them from social life, and certain privileges the white majority still felt superior.</p>
<p>In politics you&#8217;ll see the same kind of lines of demarcation drawn. Someone is only as right or left wing as they are compared to the next guy. So political groups find it necessary to define themselves by who and what they are not. The last two major election campaigns (&#8217;08, &#8217;10) both focused on change. &#8220;We are not like them&#8221;.</p>
<p>In religions it is the same way. Folks want to feel superior or more authentic so they say &#8220;we are the REAL ____ [Jews / Christian / Muslims (/ Atheists)]. Huge sects of Christianity and Islam are built on this principle. Judaism is smaller and has been united by common persecution so these tendencies may have existed but it did not yield similar results.</p>
<p>Once Jews were freed from the ghetto this phenomena found its way into Judaism. Different sects within Judaism formed and people began to define themselves by whom they were not like. Most people do what their parents do. It wasn&#8217;t a conscious choice, yet they self define &#8220;real Judaism&#8221; as their version. And their version can be so narrowly construed that no one else can fit in to their little world. It&#8217;s isolationism at its best.</p>
<p>This is what many Modern Orthodox Jews find so disturbing about Charedi Judaism. The Charedi establishment excludes non-conformists. This includes in action and in thought. For example Rabbi Natan Slifkin performs the same actions / mitzvos as the Charedim. But he is excluded for his thoughts. On the other hand, those who look the part but don&#8217;t act like Charedi Jews are also excluded. For some (maybe most) this doesn&#8217;t affect them because they have self selected themselves out of the Charedi world. But for Rabbi Slifkin who self selected himself as a Charedi Jew, this created a personal conflict. Subsequent to the entire affair he self excluded himself. The merits of Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s opinions and the merits of the Charedi criticisms are not relevant. The point is that he was excluded for his thoughts.</p>
<p>Modern Orthodox Jews are more inclusive. There is a broader range of activity and thought that is acceptable. But when someone so much as tiptoes over the line they are out. Rabbi Avi Weiss dared tread just across the line and everyone and their grandmother has &#8220;excluded&#8221; him or proclaimed him to be &#8220;beyond the pale&#8221;. The truth is that Modern Orthodoxy is more inclusive but only because they have a broader definition of what is acceptable thought and action. However, going outside that self-defined perimeter means you are outside Modern Orthodoxy. There is not more tolerance, just more tolerated activity.</p>
<p>The same thing drove the comments that ousted Esther Petrack from Modern Orthodoxy. Esther&#8217;s mother wrote that her family goes &#8220;mixed swimming&#8221; (and wear bathing suits in public). This is an accepted action within Modern Orthodoxy. (Forget halacha for a minute, this is a social issue, not a halachic issue.) Yet, Esther&#8217;s modeling was outside what some people want to define as Modern Orthodoxy so she is out. Esther self defines as Modern Orthodox. Somehow people think they have a right to tell others how they are to be defined.</p>
<p>How does it help Modern Orthodox Jew be a better person or a better Jew by excluding Esther? What is the motivation?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same phenomena. People need to feel better about themselves and they take the feel good shortcut by telling themselves and others that they are better / more important / more religious / more privileged than someone else.</p>
<p>Isolating others from the place that they define as their place is self serving. Further it can hurt others. Esther is 18 years old. If you care about her as your sister and you want her to be successful professionally and more importantly, spiritually then you would be best served offering her support and reminding her that we are her family no matter what.</p>
<p>Teens who are at-risk are the darlings of the Orthodox Jewish community. Money, time, resources, blog posts and magazine articles are dedicated to solving their problems. Do we hear anyone trying to exclude them from the places they want to be included? Of course not. I am not equating at risk teens and Esther. All I am saying is that even we have come to understand that inclusion is a much more powerful tool than exclusion.</p>
<p>This is not just about Esther. It is about being inclusive. Halacha tells us how to act. It doesn&#8217;t tell us to exclude those who may not follow halacha to the standards that we arbitrarily create.</p>
<p>Above all else: V&#8217;ahavta l&#8217;reyacha kamocha, zeh klal gadol baTorah.</p>

All three religions share a reverence for Abraham. Abraham is credited with discovering monotheism. Belief in one God enabled religions to focus on action and philosophy of religion as opposed to constant appeasement of the many Gods. Thus it is not accident that Christianity, Islam and Judaism all focus on action and understanding of religion and have passed the test of time.</p>
<p>The article in the New York Times was written by<strong> Edward Rothstein</strong> who went to school with <strong>Judd Magilnick</strong> who is a member at the <strong>Pacific Jewish Center</strong>. Judd heaped high praise on the article and for good reason. The article threads a difficult needle. It recognizes that the exhibit&#8217;s focus is the commonality of the three religions while acknowledging the challenges, historic and current that the three religions face in modern times attempting to achieve a harmonious coexistence.<span id="more-3161"></span></p>
<p>The actual exhibit features some stunning artifacts. An ancient Talmud, a 13th Century Hebrew Bible, a Guggenheim Bible and a 14th Century Quran are part of the exhibit.</p>
<p>I hope I will have a chance to see this exhibit, but I don&#8217;t foresee being in New York before the end of February when the exhibit ends.</p>
<p>So, if you can get to the museum, I would love to hear what you think about the exhibit.</p>
<p>As for me, I find the current tension between these three religions beyond annoying. I would love to see more mutual understanding between members of all sects of all these faiths. I know that when it comes to tolerance and coexistence some are better and some are worse than others. But in the current era it seems completely anachronistic to be fighting holy wars that began 2000 / 1000 / 500 / 100 years ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just not worth it.</p>
<p>Exhibits like this that show the world and show us the common ground we share are important and hopefully will be a positive step towards all around tolerance.</p>
<p>Please see the article in the NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/arts/design/23faiths.html" target="_blank">Abraham’s Progeny, and Their Texts</a></p>

<p>First, the official position of Lebanon and Hezbollah is that they are not anti-Jewish, they are anti-Zionist. This is a distinction that gets muddied by Jews and non-Jews alike. It is possible to be a religious Jew and not be in favor of the Israeli Government or even the right of Jews to settle the Land of Israel exclusively. It is also possible for people who dislike Israel&#8217;s Government but still like Jewish people. I think this is an important point.</p>
<p>Second, the restoration of the synagogue is a wonderful gesture of tolerance. Israel and Lebanon fought a war not too long ago. There is still tension between Hezbollah and Israel. However, it is possible that CITIZENS of Israel and CITIZENS of Lebanon can get along. I find the restoring of the synagogue very optimistic and a positive step toward understanding and peace.</p>
<p>Third, Maghen Abraham Synagogue has been compared to Park51 (The center that is being called the Ground Zero Mosque). Some have even called it the Ground Zero Synagogue. I support BOTH projects but I do not think they are quite the same. 3000 civilians died in an unprovoked attack against a financial building. There is no way to twist the Twin Towers into a military target. The synagogue was shelled. It was a military target and no one died. The symbolisms may be similar but it is disingenuous to compare the two. Again, I am in FAVOR of Park51 and Maghen Abraham Synagogue, I just think they are different projects. Park51 is a cultural center with a mosque. It is a building that is supposed to demonstrate moderate Islam. The synagogue will be very utilitarian with no universal message. Again, they are just very different initiatives.</p>
<p>It is my fervent hope that all people will continue to exhibit tolerance and willingness to learn about others. The more we know about one another, the more we will realize that we share much more than we don&#8217;t. Let these two symbols of freedom and tolerance promote more freedom and tolerance across the world.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, my new friend Curtis left was is the most epic comment of all on my blog a couple weeks ago. The original post is: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/18/ground-zero-mosque-vs-downtown-manhattan-islamic-cultural-center-video-debate/">Ground Zero Mosque vs. Downtown Manhattan Islamic Cultural Center: Video Debate</a> and you can see the looooog comment on the post is written by a fellow named Curtis. I have taken the time to respond to Curtis&#8217; comment. (By the way, the second most epic comment is on this post: <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;ved=0CEsQ7gUwCg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ffinkorswim.com%2F2009%2F07%2F28%2Fhave-you-been-invited-to-a-brachos-party-or-an-amen-party%2F&amp;ei=-yuDTOj_FYGgsQONu533Bw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyLPK54-h0zVs4lPRYJ8qGgg6V_w&amp;sig2=uxUnxFg2n3ulTFd0dTaHCA"> Have You Been Invited To A Brachos Party Or An Amen Party?</a> &#8211; if you don&#8217;t understand what that means, skip it).</p>
<p>Anyway, here is my response to Curtis. His comment is in italics and mine are not. Simple enough. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>Curtis says:<span id="more-2790"></span><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>I believe triumphalism is the only reason why Imam Rauf and his hidden supporters and funders want to build an Islamic center and mosque.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting belief. Do you have any basis for that belief? Or is it just &#8220;faith&#8221;?</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, there is a mosque.</em></p>
<p>Yes there is. No one said otherwise. However it is a minor part of a major building that includes Tennis courts and a culinary school.</p>
<p><em>I invite you to disprove that point. Every single reference in the media includes “and a mosque.” Representing otherwise is mere deception.</em></p>
<p>Representing that I represented otherwise is deception. I never said that. Nor did Olbermann.</p>
<p><em>But we’re learning more everyday, aren’t we? It seems Iran will not be excluded from funding the project.</em></p>
<p>Like the country? The country of Iran will not be excluded? What does this even mean? Or do you mean Iranians? I know plenty of Iranians that are wonderful people. I don&#8217;t have a problem with allowing Iranians to support this center.</p>
<p><em>Iran. Saudia Arabia. Muslims already have plenty of protectors. Why do you want to be one of them?</em></p>
<p>Wha? Am I &#8220;protecting&#8221; foreign countries by supporting a moderate Islamic cultural center?</p>
<p><em>Here’s a potential irony: The billlion plus dollars the US has given the Muslims in Gaza could be funnelled into the Cordoba project. Hamas may very well fund the project. . . with our dollars. They would love that!</em></p>
<p>That is way better than funding suicide bombers in Israel. Is it not?</p>
<p><em>How many clues does one need: The naming of the project as “Cordoba&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>It has been renamed to Park51 so as not to offend your sensibilities.</p>
<p><em>Coincidence of 10 year anniversary of the attack and the proposed date of dedication of the building.</em></p>
<p>False. There is no dedication date. The NY Post made that one up out of thin air.</p>
<p><em>Islamic history.</em></p>
<p>And what of Christian history?</p>
<p><em>The background and statements of Rauf.</em></p>
<p>Actually, these cut against you. He is a moderate. George W. Bush felt he was moderate. I see no evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p><em>The nature and reality of Sharia and Taqiyeh.</em></p>
<p>The USA has a Constitution. Sharia will never be the law here. And even if I were afraid it would be, Park51 is not who I am afraid of&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Umdat al-Salik.</em></p>
<p>See above.</p>
<p><em>Muslim Brotherhood.</em></p>
<p>And their relationship to this project is&#8230;?</p>
<p><em>MSA at UCI. (How dear are the rights to Muslim students of fellow Jews?)</em></p>
<p>See above.</p>
<p><em>Deerborn Michigan.</em></p>
<p>See above again.</p>
<p><em>Rifqa Bary.</em></p>
<p>See above again.</p>
<p><em>Johnathon Pollard. (Okay, the last doesn’t really belong in this category. I leave it to your Talmudic brilliance to make a connection. And anyway, let’s not forget Johnathon! I hope that’s one area we can agree on.)</em></p>
<p>Hardee har har har.</p>
<p><em>When those (Rauf and Kahn) who represent and promote a religion and culture which throughout the world allows no democratic rule but just the opposite; when those who refuse to reveal all the facts and persons behind their organization; when those who wrap themselves in a flag and creed not their own; when those who show little empathy for the thousands who had family and friends slain; when those who purportedly embrace outreach and compromise refuse to compromise: well . . .</em></p>
<p>Hello. This is America. The country has its own laws. Not Islamic laws. If they break those laws they will go to jail. Just like you and me.</p>
<p><em>Worse yet: For somone who has the power of Talmudic study and knows how to balance the Scriptures and Talmud, you sure seem to be decidedly “one-issue” stagnant. Is freedom of religious expession the only value to be considered?</em></p>
<p>No. It is an important issue for all non-Majority folks. I am one those. So is Park51. Censoring them is in effect censoring me as well.</p>
<p><em>How will anyone be damaged if the project is moved or even ended?</em></p>
<p>How will anyone be damaged if the project moves forward?</p>
<p><em>And do you not consider how Islam, in Europe, has managed to legislate “freedom of religion” as a singular right for Muslims so that when anyone criticizes Islam it is now categorized as hate speech?</em></p>
<p>You might want to check your facts on that one. Hate speech is a crime in all Euro countries as a response to the HOLOCAUST.</p>
<p><em>You want THAT freedom of religion?</em></p>
<p>Won&#8217;t happen here. We have a different view of Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Religion that Europe. Our 1st Amendment Tradition is much stronger.</p>
<p><em>People in our own United States are afraid to voice their opposition to Islam’s brutal and primitive Quran and teachings. Criticize Mohammad. I kill you. Leave Islam. You’re dead.</em></p>
<p>That is why I support moderate Islam. The more strength given those who are opposed to that sort of religion the better.</p>
<p><em>What has happened in Europe, you want that in America?</em></p>
<p>See above.</p>
<p><em>Anti-Semitism on the rise. Jews being attacked without any provocation.</em></p>
<p>Happens here too.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps after two millinium of surviving by absorbing the hate and persecution and learning that resistance was futile has left you bereft of outrage. But not for us. It is altogether right that we use our power, not legal in this instance, but social and cultural, to express our outrage at deception and evil. We will keep it legal, but not friendly.</em></p>
<p>You are so noble. Not. The only deception and evil present are in your own mind.</p>
<p><em>And most discouraging, your straw man arguments are reprehensible.</em></p>
<p>I made no arguments. Where is the straw man?</p>
<p><em>For while we have come to expect deception from the Muslims, so many of us are greatly saddened by such intellects and good hearts as yours and other progressives who lack the common sense to either expose the deception or think the American way is open to it.</em></p>
<p>THERE IS NO DECEPTION!</p>
<p><em>Arguing for your enemies.</em></p>
<p>How are these my enemies? They aren&#8217;t. So don&#8217;t tell me they are.</p>
<p><em>I know you think you’re doing the right thing, so more’s the pity. During World War II, couldn’t understand, didn’t believe. Oh no, surely not that. And now, is it any different.</em></p>
<p>OF COURSE IT IS DIFFERENT. There are a small number of fundamentalist Muslims that are trying to kill people. Why does that mean I should oppose Park51?</p>
<p><em>Do you have the history of the complicity, the ease with which the Muslims melded with the Nazi’s?</em></p>
<p>And what of the Pope? And all the God fearing Christians in Europe who &#8220;melded&#8221; with the Nazis as well?</p>
<p><em>Let’s just take the points you made. I’ll just refute them without naming them again: 1)Few think Osama is providing the funding, although there is little reason to not think so. Hamas came out for funding of it. Why not Osama. And we know the promoters have not been cooperative in revealing their funding. Recently we just learned they did not have all the rights to buy the adjacent building;</em></p>
<p>Why the obsession with their funding? Fox News is owned by a supporter of Terrorism. I don&#8217;t care and neither do you. Further, Osama bin Ladin hates these moderates more than you. They are the antithesis of all he stands for. Isn&#8217;t that ironic&#8230;</p>
<p><em>2) Most know by now the “Cordoba” house–renamed “park51″– is not right on top of the twin towers. There has been no disinformation campaign or suggestion of such.</em></p>
<p>Really? So you didn&#8217;t see the ads with the Twin Towers burning saying NO MOSQUE? It&#8217;s on my blog.</p>
<p><em>I haven’t even heard of anything remotely suggestive and even President Obama states the site is considered hallowed ground.</em></p>
<p>The whole lower Manhattan is Hallowed Ground?</p>
<p><em>If one has followed the news at all, one knows it is at the Burlington coat factory, and that opponents tried to convince the commission to declare the coat factory a landmark in order to prevent it being torn down and the mosque rebuilt there. There appears a subtle but real conviction in your thinking that all opponents must merely be uninformed, stupid people;</em></p>
<p>They are for the most part.</p>
<p><em>3) picking two videos where it is evident one is an emotional appeal and then comparing it to one handpicked as reasonable and mild. That’s a set-up fromt the word go. Handpicked anecdotal evidence! C’mon.</em></p>
<p>Yup. Handpicked. I couldn&#8217;t find a single reasonable opposition to the mosque. Sorry.</p>
<p><em>Again, there is, in your blog, a slight but real slight against those who oppose the mosque as somewhat benighted creatures lacking intellectual capability.</em></p>
<p>I think you are.</p>
<p><em>I might lack your intellectual powers, but I’m not the one being hoodwinked. You’re too smart for your own good. Just like 2000 years of philosophy winding up 2000 years of hard thinking with the postmodern assertion that nothing is knowable, but power is oppression and evil. These are the people who along with Muslims want to destroy Jerusalem. Forever. And you enable them. Help them. Understand them. Your wasting your time. And that’s a sin.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t preach to me about what is a sin. You are not God nor His prophet. You don&#8217;t know anything about me or what I think or how smart or dumb I am. This is just you being silly.</p>
<p><em>But worst of all is the following statement: “If people only knew the truth.” Well the truth may never be known until it’s too late because we can’t know for sure what is in the heart of Rauf.</em></p>
<p>Apparently it is known to you already&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Yet, as stated, the evidence doesn’t point to an all embracing love for all religions and mankind. He is a Muslim and most likely one that supports what happened on 911!</em></p>
<p>Where do you come off making accusations like this?! Seriously?!</p>
<p><em>He celebrates the attack</em></p>
<p>Source?</p>
<p><em>and desires the implementation of Sharia law in the United States,</em></p>
<p>Source?</p>
<p><em>which would mean the end of our institutions. He is not our friend.</em></p>
<p>Not yours. That much is clear.</p>
<p><em>He is our enemy. Can I provide proof positive? No. Just some pretty heavy circumstantial evidence!</em></p>
<p>Where? And it&#8217;s kind of absurd to imagine enemies.</p>
<p><em>He and his kind may live here but don’t expect me to believe their lies.</em></p>
<p>Why so paranoid?</p>
<p><em>And expect me to be watchful and ready. And expect me to shout like hell when they try to expand their influence.</em></p>
<p>As you should be. That is your right. And I support that right.</p>
<p><em>And really expect me to protest and get emotional when, on hallowed ground, they attempt to do something which even looks like its triumphalism.</em></p>
<p>In your own twisted mind. Listen: To the Park51 people your association of them to the 9/11 terrorists is hilarious. They don&#8217;t understand how a reasonable person could say that all Muslims / Arabs are guilty of 9/11 by association. That is a horribly bigoted and hateful thing to say. It is just like saying all Catholics are child molesters. Exactly.</p>
<p><em>What does Talmud say about negligent trust? Israel was instructed, contrary to the other nations which Gd was going to deliver into their hands, to kill all the adult males of the tribes therein listed in the Torah because Gd did not want his people to be corrupted into their practices . Now, of course, we’re not living in Israel and we’re not conquering a land, but don’t we have a responsibility to safeguard our values and liberties and traditions and institutions much like a man safeguards his premises so that innocent guests are not injured?</em></p>
<p>We do. They are not being threatened so put your pitchfork away and go home. And as for your comparisons to listening to the word of God, as far as we know God has not spoken to this issue. We don&#8217;t know what God wants.</p>
<p><em>If done for guests, how much more for family? Can you really say that allowing this particular project to proceed is in the best interests of the survival of freedom?</em></p>
<p>100% yes.</p>
<p><em>We see the march of Islam all over the world. Overtaking Europe.</em></p>
<p>France does not equal &#8220;Europe&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>It has Pakistan.</em></p>
<p>There are Muslims in Pakistan. What does that have to do with Park51?</p>
<p><em>Wants India.</em></p>
<p>Source?</p>
<p><em>All of Africa.</em></p>
<p>Interesting. So all those Missions in Africa are really fronts for Islamic Fundamentalists?</p>
<p><em>Indonesia.Russia</em>?</p>
<p>Russia??? Either way, your argument here is beyond ridiculous. Curtis says that since Muslims are &#8220;taking over the world&#8221; Park51 should be protested. EF says: Well what if they move 10 blocks away? Curtis: That would be ok. EF: How is that any less &#8220;taking over the world?????!!!!!&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>What does Islam have to offer?</em></p>
<p>What does any religion offer?</p>
<p><em>Obama has attempted to appease and befriend them.</em></p>
<p>So did George W. Bush.</p>
<p><em>His approval has decreased with them. We have nothing to prove to the world, especially when seeking approval imperils our survival.</em></p>
<p>That is a fair criticism of the President. But then again, W. also tried to ingratiate himself in the Arab world. Hmmm.</p>
<p><em>Your singleminded devotion to progressive and multicultural largesse is out of order here.</em></p>
<p>Singleminded? Do you know what I am passionate about?</p>
<p><em>People with the ability to balance the truth of a statement with who is saying it, ie., those with commons sense, aren’t about to accept a Trojan horse.</em></p>
<p>You do realize that the Trojan horse was a TRICK. The Greeks FOOLED the Trojans. Are you so paranoid that you think that Park51 is a Trojan Horse? And again &#8211; how would moving it help at all???</p>
<p><em>I think the Greek allusion is especially appropriate here. There has always been the temptation for God’s people to follow the wisdom of the world or mix it with his Torah. The calamity here is that one who has been schooled in Torah and Talmud has had those treasures perverted by progressive deception.</em></p>
<p>So you&#8217;re the expert on what the Torah says? And what God wants? Really?</p>
<p><em>That you could even write such an article is worse than the proposed “community center” being built.</em></p>
<p>Hyperbole at best. Blasphemy at worst. But in the end I would rather toss my hat with moderates like them than fundamentalists LIKE YOU!</p>

<p>The Westboro Baptist Church practices and preaches an extremely fundamental version of Christianity. They hold that God punishes American soldiers in Iraq because there are &#8220;Gays in the military&#8221;. They hate Jews because Jews are they killed Jesus and are the cause of fornication. They protest at shuls, Holocaust Museums and funerals of soldiers. They are fundamentalists and like many fundies are obscene, anti-social and hateful.</p>
<p>There are orthodox Jews who practice a very fundamental view of Judaism. They say that God killed<span id="more-2698"></span> the Haitians in a massive earthquake because of Gays in the military (or Lashon Hara) See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/04/why-the-earthquake-in-haiti-happened/">Why The Earthquake in Haiti Happened</a>. They say that Hurricane Katrina was punishment for Mardi Gras. They have been known to murder innocent people for the sake of their beliefs They hate liberals because they allow for depravity such as gay marriage. They protest all over on behalf of their causes.</p>
<p>There are Jihadist Muslims who practice a very fundamental and oftentimes violent version of Islam. They wish to rid the world of infidels, including Jews. They have bombed and fired weapons and thrown rocks in favor of their cause. They hate pretty much everyone that is not exactly like them and have no desire to integrate into a democratic society.</p>
<p>There are environmentalists who believe in a very fundamental version of liberalism. They are super passionate about the environment and nature. They stand in front of bulldozers, destroy private property and call people names all to protect nature. They put their lives at risk for their cause and spend millions of dollars promoting their cause. They put their cause above all else (for example instead of procreating) See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/22/green-gone-wild/">Green Gone Wild</a>.</p>
<p>In all these examples, the extremists make a lot of noise and find their way into the headlines. Would it be fair to associate these extreme elements with the more moderate practitioners of their ideologies? Of course not. I don&#8217;t want to be judged by the crazed acts of fundamentalist orthodox Jews and I am sure that moderate Muslims, Christian and Liberals feel the same way about the extremists in their ideologies.</p>
<p>Extremism is bad. Nobody likes it except the ones acting extreme. I find it disturbing that Islam is judged solely by its extreme and fairly recent activities. Prior to the 20th century, Muslims were far more benevolent to members of other religions than Christians were. Recently, extremists have become the face of Islam. I think that is unfortunate. It is our best interest to support moderate forms of Islam and help them fight against the extremists.</p>
<p>Are there dangerous forms of Islam? Yes. Are there dangerous forms of all faiths, beliefs and ideologies? Yes again. We should be working together to foster moderates who are tolerant of others in all walks of life.</p>

<p>It seems that the Cordoba House in downtown Manhattan has cleared a major hurdle by winning a 9-0 vote of the Landmarks Conservation Commission. (NY Times <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/mosque-near-ground-zero-clears-key-hurdle/?hp" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>Conservatives and liberals seem to be at loggerheads on this particular issue. Sarah Palin made headlines with her plea that the center be blocked and fellow right wing pundits have expressed their distaste to the center. They feel it disgraces the deceased by glorifying what they believe to be the religion that caused the tragedy at Ground Zero almost 9 years ago. Liberals, on the other hand, see the center as an olive branch to Islam and think the center glorifies America, not the dangerous form of Islamic Fundamentalism that took down the Twin Towers, 3000 victims and the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say whether the center is an affront or not.<span id="more-2689"></span> That&#8217;s because it varies with each person. Everyone is free to react as they choose. I can&#8217;t say one side is right and one side is wrong.</p>
<p>What I can say is that the center has a bad marketing plan.</p>
<p>The center is not a mosque. It is a massive cultural center. There is a sanctuary planned but it is a minor part of a broader institution. An institution that, according to their website attempts to bring the gap between Islam and the West. An institution that also fights for women&#8217;s rights and opportunitities within Islam. In fact, if we are to believe the Cordoba website, it is exactly what Americans (especially Conservatives) should be supporting.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cordoba House is a Muslim-led project which will build a world-class facility that promotes tolerance, reflecting the rich diversity of New York City.  The center will be community-driven, serving as a platform for inter-community gatherings and cooperation at all levels, providing a space for all New Yorkers to enjoy.</p>
<p>This proposed project is about promoting integration, tolerance of difference and community cohesion through arts and culture.  Cordoba House will provide a place where individuals, regardless of their backgrounds, will find a center of learning, art and culture; and most importantly, a center guided by Islamic values in their truest form &#8211; compassion, generosity, and respect for all.</p>
<p>The site will contain tremendous amounts of resources that otherwise would not exist in Lower Manhattan; a 500-seat auditorium, swimming pool, art exhibition spaces, bookstores, restaurants &#8211; all these services would form a cultural nexus for a region of New York City that, as it continues to grow, requires the sort of hub that Cordoba House will provide.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why call themselves a mosque? Bad marketing.</p>
<p>The center is not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221; either. It is 2 blocks away. If you&#8217;ve never been to Manhattan you can&#8217;t appreciate how FAR part 2 blocks in NYC are. Two blocks in Manhattan is very far. It is a few minutes walk and more importantly, it is certainly not within the line of sight. They should be saying that their center is a few minutes walk from Ground Zero. Not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221;.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2690" title="Cordoba Location" src="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map1.jpg?resize=500%2C245" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>So the Mosque at Ground Zero is neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero. It is an Islamic Center in Downtown Manhattan. Is that still as offensive to those who oppose the center?</p>
<p>The only reasonable explanation for opposition that remains is conspiracy.</p>
<p>In other words, the website is a sham. The REAL purpose of Cordoba House is to spread Fundamental Islam and serve as a springboard for the continued spread of Islam in their quest for world dominance. This is Islamaphobia.</p>
<p>There are people who believe this to be the case. I do not.</p>
<p>If you are asking me, which you aren&#8217;t, I say support the Cordoba House and the brand of Islam they espouse and perhaps get involved a see it for yourself if you are not convinced. Working together will go a long way.</p>

<p>(What is Hijab? click <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hijab" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Most of us think of the black, shapeless head to toe covering when we think of the Hijab. According the article, the black color, and amorphous shape is not required in Islamic Law. Hijab is a modesty that requires that the body be covered completely by clothing. It is permissible to add color and style to the Hijab.</p>
<p>The article highlights some locals who are celebrating their personal style within the limits of what is required by Hijab.</p>
<p>I think that is great.<span id="more-2531"></span></p>
<p>It is really very similar to the way many orthodox Jewish women follow the Jewish laws of tznius. There are rules of modesty but in no way does that need to hinder one&#8217;s sense of style. Many of the drab dressing folks are just drab dressing folks, it is not that they are more pious in their adherence to tznius. Rather, they just don&#8217;t use the opportunities within the system to look great.</p>
<p>It is important for people that are religious to maintain their standards. But I believe it is also important to modernize the social things that are not determined by religious law. These Muslim women are doing just that. They are taking their religious law and strictly adhering to the law. But they are also making it more comfortable for a 21st Century Woman.</p>
<p>Just as some people are uncomfortable wearing the black, amorphous HIjab, there are those who are uncomfortable when they see women dressed that way. It defies the Western Standards of how women should dress. I understand how it can be offensive. Trying to adapt to a more current way of following Islamic Law is a great way to bridge the gap. The more common ground that is shared between the &#8220;West&#8221; and Islamic World the greater our chances of peace.</p>
