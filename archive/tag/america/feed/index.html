				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>There is no more perfect secular holiday than Thanksgiving. It has a universal message, warm traditions, and is versatile enough to work to all kinds of people. I think it&#8217;s especially wonderful that so many Jewish people, including Orthodox Jews, have embraced Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>On a Jewish level there is nothing more basic than giving thanks. Gratitude begins the moment we arise with Modeh Ani. But that is a private declaration of appreciation to God. Thanksgiving gives us an opportunity to build greater gratitude with our friends and family. It&#8217;s a time to publicly give thanks to God and all the people in our lives who deserves appreciation. It&#8217;s true that we must be thankful everyday, but setting aside one day a year as a communal expression of appreciation is a wise tradition.<span id="more-7907"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7908" alt="The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961-600x382.jpg" width="360" height="229" /></a>Further, Jews need to be thankful simply for the existence of Thanksgiving. It is a uniquely American holiday and we have been blessed in America, flourishing and growing in unprecedented numbers. Thanksgiving celebrates America. We must celebrate America too. Indeed, we must be thankful for Thanksgiving itself.</p>
<p>Most of all, Thanksgiving gives us a splendid opportunity to share in an American tradition with our fellow Americans. So many other American traditions are antithetical to Torah and Judaism. We can&#8217;t in good conscience join in those celebrations. Christmas? Drinking and debauchery on New Years? Easter? as well as several other hallowed American traditions are not our traditions. But this one, Thanksgiving, that&#8217;s right in our wheelhouse. It gives us the chance to join together with the rest of America and in unison say thank you. That in itself is worth the effort to participate in the holiday. Although we don&#8217;t primarily associate as Americans, rather we are Jews first, it is a powerful declaration of unity to connect with 300 million Americans from diverse backgrounds, with a plurality of beliefs to celebrate Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>This year it&#8217;s even more fun as we can merge and meld some of our Chanukah traditions with Thanksgiving. The connections between the two holidays are self evident. Both were belated Sukkos style celebrations giving thanks to God. They are like siblings from the same parents.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s enjoy the holiday and be proud to live in a country that makes a holiday out of giving thanks, just like us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6650" alt="ap_newtown_sandy_hook_school_Sign_balloons_thg_121215_wg" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ap_newtown_sandy_hook_school_Sign_balloons_thg_121215_wg-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" />There are no words to properly describe the horror of last friday&#8217;s shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. I was a wreck the entire Friday. My job requires me to be strong and put on a good face over Shabbos. I did the best I could. My sermon was heavily influenced by my feelings about the tragedy. After Shabbos and on Sunday and Monday, it was still too hard to get through full sentences when reading or talking about the tragedy. It was impossible to watch the news.</p>
<p>I did talk a little about the tragedy on Facebook and tried to facilitate some discussion. But it was too hard to write about it in this space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still hard, but less so at this point. That&#8217;s the blessing of our ability to forget. But it&#8217;s also a curse to be able forget if we don&#8217;t do what we can to prevent future tragedy.</p>
<p>I have a few things to say on the tragedy and they are not really related. So please excuse the unrelated points in this post.<span id="more-6649"></span></p>
<p><strong>I. Children</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to read about parents losing their children in this senseless shooting and not be so thankful every day that our children (or your brothers and sisters, or your nieces and nephews) are safe. It makes us pause and reflect on how precious our children are to us. It makes us want to shower our children with love and keep them safe and happy. It makes us forget any <em>tzaar gidul banim </em>that we may have felt. All we want to do is reassure our children that they will be okay and that we will always be there for them. People mean it when they say &#8220;hug your children a little more&#8221; after a tragedy like this. I know I did.</p>
<p><strong>II. Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>We need better mental health awareness and care in this country. This area of medicine is always evolving and what we know now is so much more than what we knew years ago. We can do more than ever for people who need help. But unfortunately, there is a very negative stigma attached to those who need mental health care. We push people away from it as long as possible to avoid the stigma and then it can sometimes be too late to make a real difference. So while more care is important, it is even more important that those who need and receive care are not stigmatized.</p>
<p>A few hundred years ago we would have said that these people were possessed by the devil or a dybbuk. Now we know better. But we need to act differently and not see them as horrible people, rather they are people with challenges just like everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>III. Empathy</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge America faces as a society is that we do not share a common ancestry or ethnicity. It is also a huge blessing and makes America a beautiful melting pot. But because we are not as connected as people in other nations our sense of community suffers. People feel isolated. We live very manufactured lives. Most of us are not involved in the process of producing stuff, we just consume stuff. We are detached from our communities and neighbors. This has several harmful effects.</p>
<p>First, it means that if the neighbor&#8217;s kid is acting strange or we think he needs help, we don&#8217;t say anything. It&#8217;s not our business, we say. We are not comfortable poking into other people&#8217;s lives. Privacy is great and I think people should mind their own business. The problem is that &#8220;their own business&#8221; is so narrow that it only includes a very small number of people. I think it&#8217;s healthy when people are able to have relationships with others that change their business into your own business. If you think about it, my brother&#8217;s business is my business. That&#8217;s because we care about each other. We love each other. What he does matters to me. But I don&#8217;t feel that way about my neighbor. Certainly, some bounderies are necessary for a functioning society, but I think we need to care about each other more. When we think someone needs help, we need to have the courage to say something and we also need to have the courage to hear it and not lash out against those trying to help.</p>
<p>Second, it means that someone can get to the point that they are so isolated that they can shoot children and not care. A person who feels empathy and connects with others in their community does not kill people in that community. This is a general solution that could solve so much of our crime. People don&#8217;t harm people that they care about. We need to expand the group of people of whom we care about.</p>
<p>We need to figure out why mass shootings are a uniquely American phenomena. I think this might be part of the reason. Judaism very strongly promotes creating this kind of empathetic society. We need to do a better job amongst ourselves to play our role as a light unto the nations.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Guns</strong></p>
<p>I am<b> </b>not going to discuss arguments for or against increased gun control laws. It&#8217;s a very, very, very complicated issue and neither side of the debate has a viable solution.</p>
<p>However, I have a different observation. Let&#8217;s assume that increased or decreased gun control laws won&#8217;t significantly affect future mass shootings. There is still an argument to be made that some people don&#8217;t want to &#8220;live in a place that embraces / bans guns&#8221;. In other words, sometimes the law is not what makes the difference, it&#8217;s the principle of the law. Pro-gun people will say &#8220;I want to live in a place where citizens can have guns and have the right to defend themselves against violent crime&#8221;. Anti-gun people will say &#8220;I want to live in a place where gun ownership is taboo&#8221;.</p>
<p>But I think this argument is flawed. We should all want to live in a place where all kinds of people want to live. Isolating some or many of them is selfish. One will hear similar arguments about gay marriage. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if people are gay. I just don&#8217;t want to live in a place that being gay is considered normal and a law that recognizes gay marriage does just that&#8221;. This argument is also abhorrent. We should all want to live in a place that gives every non-criminal or non-danger to society a comfortable place to exist. I feel the same way about this genre of argument regarding guns.</p>
<p>The only thing that I will say about the gun debate in our country is that it has become a very partisan issue and that precludes meaningful discussion. I don&#8217;t think there is any one event that would sway an ardent gun advocate to the other side of the debate, lest they change ideology and vice versa. More mass shootings turn into arguments for more guns and just as passionately against guns.</p>
<p>I will just say that owning a gun is a serious halachic issue, particularly if one has children in the home and must be discussed with a halachic authority or independently researched.</p>
<p><strong>V. Theodicy</strong></p>
<p>People will ask: How does God allow senseless murders? Why do tragedies like this happen?</p>
<p>There is only answer that is acceptable. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Any moron who says anything other than &#8220;we don&#8217;t know&#8221; needs to be stopped. Please.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/9-11-01-logo-300x285.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4592" title="9-11-01-logo-300x285" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/9-11-01-logo-300x285.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="285" /></a>There are seemingly infinite ways to commemorate 9|11.</p>
<p>I plan several posts over the weekend to express my feelings, memories and hope for this important day in American history.</p>
<p>The first of these posts illustrates to me that 9|11 really has two components. The national component and the personal. On a national level we were thrust into mourning and war. It is a war that does not seem likely to end anytime soon. Every day without a terrorist attack is a day that we have won that war. But that war also carries a very significant price tag. Lives, dollars, foreign relations and other corners of life have suffered. In the end, we can only hope the sacrifices are worthwhile.</p>
<p>The more compelling component, that is less widely discussed is the personal component. By personal, I mean the effects of the tragedy on individuals and their subsequent stories of survival, rebuilding and healing.</p>
<p>The nexus of the national and personal stories is found in the media. The media is in a position to nationalize the personal stories. I find the various ways of expressing these stories absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>I have chosen 4 different media outlets to illustrate this.<span id="more-4588"></span></p>
<p><strong>ESPN</strong></p>
<p>On ESPN, the 9|11 narrative is told from the perspective of a sports fan. Great moments in sports led up to September 11, 2001. Agassi v. Sampras, Bonds hitting #61, 62 and 63 (of 73), Michael Jordon unretired. These seemed like important moments at the time. Nothing compared to 9|11.</p>
<p>Sports also played a prominent role in our healing. Getting back to business and playing those games told us and our enemies that they cannot destroy America and our vibrant culture. Sports offered an escape when we needed it most.</p>
<p>ESPN&#8217;s article is a must read for any sports fan.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/6937733/sports-sept-11-2001-espn-magazine" target="_blank">ESPN</a></p>
<p><strong>People Magazine</strong></p>
<p>I am NOT a reader of People. I noticed their cover story at CVS and I found it very interesting. The magazine chronicles the lives of children born to a parent who died on 9|11.</p>
<p>What a powerful lens through which to see the tragedy of it all. This is as personal as it gets. Yet, we can relate to it all through these almost 10 year old children. It also reminds us that we have a lot to live for. The next generation of America needed us to snap out of our funk.</p>
<p>I have not read the article, though I did see a video on the article and here is the short synopsis on <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20524377,00.html" target="_blank">People.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Slate</strong></p>
<p>In its inimitable way, Slate takes us back to when we had the Twin Towers. We see the Twin Towers through the camera lens and we are shown pictures where the Towers look small. They loom in the distance. The slideshow is called Tiny Towers.</p>
<p>To me, these photos are powerful and personal. They remind us that the Towers were part of the tapestry of New York life. Always there. Always tall.</p>
<p>But seeing them looking so small also reminds me that everything is a matter of perspective. Sometimes things can look so large. Larger than life. But when we pull back, the same towering ideas can become much smaller.</p>
<p>Our national mourning was so intimidating. But as we pulled back, we gained the perspective needed to heal.</p>
<p>Check out the photos here: <a href="http://www.slate.com/slideshow/arts/tiny-towers/">Slate</a></p>
<p><strong>CNN</strong></p>
<p>At the gym I saw a documentary being promoted on CNN. The idea of the documentary is to take all the details, all the footnotes of history and have them tell the stories. We hear from the ticketing agent who sold Mohammed Atta his ticket. We hear about all the minutia of the day and events that led up to the day. We hear from everyday people. It&#8217;s personal.</p>
<p>These details of everyday life give the event a more personal nature. They humanize it into a seemingly random selection of moments. But we know how profound those moments became.</p>
<p>This perspective reminds all of us that our acts and thoughts matter. Each moment can and does make a tremendous difference. Sometimes we can see it right away and other times we cannot. But it is there.</p>
<p>See it here: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/09/06/september.11.footnotes/index.html" target="_blank">The Footnotes of September 11</a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>In the end, the collective message is that in America we celebrate diversity. We celebrate different points of view. We challenge ourselves to have a voice and to hear the voice of others. Seeing just four of the myriad ways to remember on this 9|11 affirms the splendor and beauty of America.</p>
<p>On a national scale we may never completely win this war.</p>
<p>On a personal level we won a long time ago. We won on September 12, 2001 &#8211; the very next day. By continuing to do and believe in what make America great, each of us, as individuals has defeated each and all of the terrorists who changed it all 10 years ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/statue.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4391" title="statue" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/statue-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>When considering the importance of the July 4th holiday in America, it is almost impossible to overstate it. July 4th is the day it all began. It is the day that set into motion all of the wonderful things that is the United States of America.</p>
<p>Perhaps above all, the second line of the Declaration of Independence illustrates why July 4th 1776 changed the world forever.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This line has taken on a life that goes well beyond the intended meaning of this proclamation. It has become a calling card for civil rights and equality for all. It has created an environment where many religions have been able to flourish alongside seculars and humanists. It has created a country where no one can be discriminated against for their beliefs.<span id="more-4390"></span></p>
<p>In theory this is certainly a powerful sentiment. But if people are forced into non-discrimination would that create a harmonious atmosphere of different groups working together? Or would it simply protect against overt acts of violence or threats between groups?</p>
<p>In real life, it&#8217;s a mixed bag. Too often it is the latter. When it is the former it is worth noting. Especially on July 4th.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s LA Times ran an article about the LA Eruv. (What&#8217;s an Eruv? My explanation is here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/11/the-good-wife-unorthodox-from-a-rabbi-law-student-perspective/">The Good Wife: Unorthodox, From a Rabbi / Law Student Perspective</a>.) The LA Eruv uses the 405 Freeway for one of its walls. In case you haven&#8217;t heard, the 405 is the world&#8217;s biggest parking lot. During rush hour it can literally take an hour to travel a mile. To help relieve some of the stress on the 405, Caltrans is doing some construction.</p>
<p>The 405&#8242;s most dense corridor runs between the 10 Freeway and the 101 Freeway. That corridor will be 100% closed for TWO FULL DAYS. Los Angeles will be a traffic nightmare. (<a href="http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/06/405_freeway_closure_july_16_17_traffic_los_angeles_subway.php" target="_blank">Carmaggedon</a> &#8211; of course)</p>
<p>All the construction has also been a potential nightmare for the Eruv committee. Each project along the 405 breaks the wall and it is necessary to fill that area in with a temporary &#8220;wall&#8221; until the construction in that area is complete. Working together with Caltrans, the Eruv committee has been able to satisfy the halachic requirements for the Eruv every week during the construction.</p>
<p>But they have help. Howard Witkin, an administrator with the LA Eruv says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;The level of help we&#8217;ve had, from the Roman Catholic permit people at Caltrans … to the Muslim line inspector along the freeways who gave us engineering help.…The level of deference and courtesy and kindness — it makes you feel good that you live in America.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Yes it does.</p>
<p>So on July 4th, we celebrate the birth of a country that enables this kind of relationship between vastly different groups with very different beliefs.</p>

<p>Persistence pays off. Photographer Jay Fine waited over 40 years for this picture. And it is spectacular.</p>
<p>A bolt of lightning striking the Statue of Liberty. Wow.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the message?</p>
<p>Perhaps that freedom and liberty are a lightning rod topic. Some people value it, others don&#8217;t. Some people want to spread the message of freedom and liberty, others say don&#8217;t impose specific  values on others. Some say we have freedom and liberty in the United States of America, others say that we do not. Some say that America stands for freedom and liberty, others want to take that away. <span id="more-3103"></span>Plenty to think about&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, here is the pic. Enjoy.</p>
