				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6936" alt="baby" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-300x294.png" width="300" height="294" />The beginning of Parshas Tazria instructs the Jewish people on commandments that relate to matters of childbirth. One law sates that a woman who gives birth is ritually impure for seven days if she bears a son and fourteen days if she bears a daughter.</p>
<p>The Torah does not tell us why there is a difference between the days of ritual impurity for a son and a daughter. Naturally, this led our great rabbis to speculate and provide their own insights into these laws. Inevitably these commentaries will reflect the social and scientific norms of their milieu.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to track the development of these ideas.</p>
<p>Two general categories of interpretations are given to explain the discrepancy between the days of impurity for a son and a daughter. One category goes the social route and the other goes the medical route.<span id="more-6935"></span></p>
<p>The social route generally considers sons to be a great blessing and daughters to be a bit of a curse. Rabbi Josh Waxman has a great example of one medieval commentator who takes this tack (see: <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com/2013/04/guys-rule-in-tazria.html">Guys rule in Tazria</a>). One can see hints of this sort of thinking in the Talmud as well. Boys earned money for the family while girls were a financial strain on the ancient family. Thus, it follows that there would be a longer period of ritual impurity for a daughter because it was less joyous. I&#8217;m not sure how this actually works logically, but you do see this line of thinking.</p>
<p>The medical route considers the birth of a son to be easier or to expel less blood or that girls are born &#8220;cooler&#8221; so the mother needs longer to heal because coolness causes illness or that boys are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 40 days and girls are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 80 days. These are ideas found in the Rishonim to explain the double waiting time for a daughter.</p>
<p>None of these reasons would satisfy the modern reader of the Chumash. No matter how &#8220;frum&#8221; one may be, these explanations don&#8217;t work anymore. Either because girls no longer cost more than boys, or because daughters are not considered a curse. Further, we know that the medicine found in these interpretations is incorrect as well.</p>
<p>Artscroll, which is by and large very traditionalist in their interpretations, shies away from these ancient commentaries as well. They are almost forced to pluck a beautiful idea from a very unlikely source to give some sort of explanation here. Artscroll quotes R&#8217; Dovid Tzvi Hoffman (late 19th century) who says that really the appropriate amount of days would be fourteen days. But since we want the mother of the child to attend the Bris Milah the Torah subtracts some time from the ritual impurity and knocks it down to seven days so that she will be able to participate in her son&#8217;s entering of the covenant.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Hoffman&#8217;s answer is lovely. But it is not found in earlier commentaries. The reason for that is because up until recently, the other interpretations were plausible. Once those interpretations became anachronistic, another interpretation was needed. R&#8217; Hoffman provides one such interpretation. Artscroll is written for 21st century Jews. They wisely choose the newer, more modern interpretation for their publication.</p>
<p>The beginning of the parsha also features some ancient science on conception. The verse says that a &#8220;woman who seeds a seed a births a son.&#8221; The implication is that the son is born because because the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221;. The Talmud explains that when the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a son. When the man &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a daughter. Ramban explains that the woman&#8217;s blood meets the man&#8217;s semen and they are the two ingredients that form the child. Whichever is &#8220;first&#8221; determines the gender. With this (wrong) medical explanation, the verse makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Ramban also brings the Greek version of conception which is different and has nothing to do with who is first. So he then explains how the verse is rendered if one holds like the Greeks! Ramban says that the word simply means seed in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>What are we to make of all this?</p>
<p>First of all, we see several examples of interpretations from ancient times that no longer work today. We are forced to abandon these commentaries and seek out newer commentaries. More importantly, it means that the ancient commentaries were based on conventional wisdom of their times. They did the best they could with what they had available to them. But their commentaries were not infallible. Particularly in areas of matters that are flux we cannot avoid the conclusion that they made mistakes and that their science or social conventions were not Divine.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think we see that even Ramban himself wasn&#8217;t so sure that Chazal were right about conception. He quotes the Greeks and gives a less elegant interpretation of the verse to reconcile their view. What does this mean? It means that when science buttresses up against the words of a verse, we are forced to reconcile the verse using creative interpretations. That must be allowed. After all the Ramban did just that. Today we are faced with similar challenges. Sometimes the old, simpler interpretations no longer work. What would Ramban do? He would reinterpret. But who among us has the shoulders of Ramban? Anyone? No one?</p>
<p>It is possible that the next Ramban is in our midst today. But with our somewhat stifling manner of Chumash study which hardly allows for innovation and reinterpretation, how will our Ramban ever show himself? Or perhaps she is a she? Who knows? One thing is clear, we don&#8217;t learn or teach Chumash the same way our ancestors learned Chumash. Instead we teach ChumashÂ <em>the way our ancestors taught it.</em> I think we can do better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/laura-talmudStretch.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5618" title="laura-talmudStretch" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/laura-talmudStretch-253x300.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="300" /></a>I received a press release for the New English Talmud from Koren a few days ago. With all the excitement over the Asifa and the unexpected brouhaha over the role of women in chasidic Judaism, I neglected to post my initial thoughts on this edition of the Talmud.</p>
<p>First of all, I am a huge fan of the Talmud. I think studying Talmud is amazing. The experience of Talmud study, when done right, can be at least as inspirational and spiritually satisfying as anything else in the world. The problem is that it can be a locked book. An English translation is nice, but so much of the Talmud requires background information and illustration that the simple rendering of the words into English is not sufficient to unlock the Talmud.</p>
<p>Artscroll has magnificently risen to the occasion with their English Talmud. Their contribution marked a key turning point for mainstreaming Talmud study. Their translation and interpretations follow Yeshiva style conventions. The Artscroll Talmud may be the greatest contribution to Torah study since the first printing of the Tamud in the 16th century. Its commentary digest is extremely well researched and presented and the sheer magnitude of the project is awe-inspiring.<span id="more-5617"></span></p>
<p>It is hard to believe, but 30 years prior to the Artscroll Talmud was conceived, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz began a similar project translating the Talmud into modern Hebrew and penning a fresh Hebrew commentary digest. His work would have been more widely used if he had maintained the canonized page format of all the previous printings of the Talmud. But he did not and his version was placed under Rabbinic ban.</p>
<p>The New English Talmud will provide another option for English speaking sudents of the Talmud. The translation is adapted from Rabbi Steinsaltz&#8217;s translation into modern Hebrew and the commentary is his. But in keeping with tradition, the New English Talmud stays true to the canonized pagination of the Talmud thus rectifying an unfortunate error in the previous versions.</p>
<p>More options is a good thing. In particular, this version has an emphasis on the aesthetic, taking layout seriously and using color illustrations. It truly looks to be a remarkable and fresh way to study the Talmud. Plus, having two big names in the English Talmud game will force both to step up their games and bring even more innovative, high quality products to the market.</p>
<p>Artscroll announced their iPad app a few months ago. Koren is also supplying an app. Only a few details are available at this point but I look forward to using both of them.</p>
<p>My shul has a set of Artscroll and I have been gifted (by a loving family member) a significant selection of the New English Talmud so I will be able to do a more complete comparison after I receive my copy. In the meantime, if you are considering an English Talmud purchase, I strongly urge you to consider the Koren version. It looks to be amazing.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, the YouTube video promo for the New English Talmud is a tad on the ridiculous side. I&#8217;m not sure what they were thinking.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fshas.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5217" title="fshas" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fshas-300x176.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="176" /></a>In case you have not heard, Artscroll is joining the digital revolution. Perhaps Artscroll&#8217;s greatest contribution to date is the Schottenstein Talmud. Their version of the Talmud is comprehensive and useful for beginners and scholars alike. It has likely opened the doors of Talmud study to more people than any other edition of the Talmud in the history of the Talmud.</p>
<p>Now Artscroll is taking the Talmud to the next level. As mentioned previously, the iPad is a magical Torah study device. It lends itself to Torah study more than any other piece of technology. You can hold it in your hand, you navigate with your fingers, pop-ups are the perfect method for providing additional information beyond the text that is so key to Talmud study. Artscroll is bringing the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud to the iPad.</p>
<p>The features are extensive and the video below outlines many of the key features. It&#8217;s a really impressive feature set.<span id="more-5216"></span></p>
<p>iTalmud did a wonderful job with their limited resources. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/14/italmud-ipad-edition-app-review/" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a>. They did not have access to the copyrighted material and research that went into the Schottenstein edition. But iTalmud pales in comparison to what Artscroll can offer. Of course I expect this to be reflected in the price, iTalmud is $40. Each volume of the printed Shottenstein Talmud is $40 and some tractates are several volumes long. If ebook prices are any indication, the Artscroll digital edition will be priced similarly to the printed edition. That is a lot of money.</p>
<p>A source tells me that there will be various options to gain access to the app. You can buy a daf, a tractate or the entire Shas. There will also be a rental model that will allow users to follow along with the Daf Yomi giving access to each particular daf for a limited time. I think the price will be one of the more interesting story lines as the app moves from development to the marketplace.</p>
<p>The iPad will be the first digital edition of the Shottenstein but my source also tells me that Android and desktop version will eventually follow.</p>
<p>Artscroll has hired the best Jewish app developer out there in <a href="http://www.rustybrick.com/" target="_blank">RustyBrick</a> to write the software and you can be confident that the final product will be elegant, simple to use and very powerful. RustyBrick also works hard to constantly update their apps to bring more features to the end users. I am happy for my friends at RustyBrick.</p>
<p>Artscroll is doing this because they think it will be a good business decision. I am happy that they are ready to embrace the digital era. Now we just need to get our yeshivos and rabbinic leaders to follow the lead of the community.</p>
<p>Here is a severely overdramatic video about the upcoming app. Whatever happened to understated, humble marketing? Yeesh. This thing is way out of control. (I also don&#8217;t love using copyrighted music for a product that so covets its own copyrights.) But shout out to my friend <a href="http://baltimorejewishlife.com" target="_blank">Jeff Cohn</a> who makes a cameo at 3:00!</p>
