<h1>Parshas Bo</h1>
<h1>Borrowed  Success and a Shared future</h1>
<p>The process of Geulas Mitzrayim is filled with the Hashgacha of the yad Hashem each step of the way. It reaches its climax with makas bechoros, as Pharaoh finally demands that Klal Yisrael leave what was left of his tattered empire. The Torah delineates the events leading up to and immediately following Yitzias Mitzrayim to teach us that the Geula was a step-by-step process. Along the way, a fascinating dichotomy is revealed. As the Mitzrim were being readied to expel Bnei Yisrael from their midst – through the impact of the makkos, Klal Yisrael was being prepared for Geula through various takanos and tzivuyim which culminated with the Korban Pesach and continued to progress until ma’amad Har Sinai.</p>
<p>One interesting requirement was the tzivui to “borrow” gold and silver from the Mitzrim. <span id="more-2057"></span>It is thrice referred to in the sipur yitzias Mitzrayim, each time with a different twist. First, Moshe Rabbeinu is told (Shmos 3:22) “V’shaalah isha mishchenta umigaras beisa klei kesef uklei zahav,” that the Nshei Yisrael will “borrow” from their Egyptian neighbors silver and gold. Moshe was being reassured that Bnai Yisrael would not leave Mitzrayim empty handed.  However, when it came time to carry out this tzivui following makas choshech, Klal Yisrael is told, “Viyshalu ish me’ais reyahu, visha me’ais reusa” each man should borrow from his friend, and each woman from hers silver and golden finery. The third reference found a perek later expresses that when Klal Yisrael left Egypt, “Vayishalu mimitzrayim”, they took from the Egyptians silver, gold and clothing.</p>
<p>Whereas the first and third points refer to what ultimately transpired with the Mitzrim, the second command seems to convey a different message. It describes an expectation for the Jewish people to borrow objects from reyahu, a friend – a term that usually implies a fellow Jew. Clearly the Mitzrim were not our friends. What, then, is the message being conveyed? The Toldos Adam explains that, indeed, before the exodus, Klal Yisrael was first commanded to ask and borrow valuables from each other. This was done to teach the importance of sharing as a prerequisite for nationhood. Interdependence, the essential component of Arvus, had to be learned before we could stand at Har Sinai and embark on our national destiny as the Ohr Laa’amim. To become the Am Segula, free to do mitzvos and spiritually mature and ready for Matan Torah, Jews could not behave &#8220;each man for himself.&#8221; We had to learn to appreciate and depend upon each other. To ask, give and receive, to and from whoever comes our way. Hashem Yisborach asked the Jews in Mitzrayim to borrow (and return) from one other, not merely to acquire valuable treasures, but, more importantly, to treasure the value of being part of the family of Klal Yisrael. Only then would we be ready for the next step in the Geuala. Once this happened it was only natural that the Mitzrim sensed the obvious chein of Klal Yisrael and gave them even more than they asked for.</p>
<p>This lesson should not be lost on us as we await the Geula Ha’asida. Each and every Jew must feel a kindred sense of dependency and comfort with others. We are all sisters and brothers, ready to be mamlich the Ribbono Shel Olam, and IY”H be mikabel Ol Malchus Shamayim k’ish echad blev echad.</p>

<p><strong><em>A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a (hopefully) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></strong></p>
<h1>Arvus</h1>
<p>As a part of Moshe’s last words of chizuk and reproach to Am Yisrael, we are told that there will be a time when we will r”l stray so far from the Ribbono Shel Olam that Hakadosh Boruch Hu will be doubly hidden from us. Bereft of feeling His presence we suffer terrible tragedy. What are we to do? <span id="more-1139"></span>We are to turn to Torah. The “song” written for us to sing in our most difficult days. Indeed, Chazal teach us, Barasi yetzer harah borasi Torah tavlin. This maxim reminds us that the power of Torah and learning can help us overcome every obstacle.</p>
<p>Interstingly, the Kli Yakar expands on this theme and wonders what was the critical avierah that put us over the edge. Where did we lose it? What caused us to drift so far away? His poignant answer is wake up call to each and every Jew.</p>
<p>Our failure, says the Kli Yakar, is a breakdown in our arvus – in our interdependence, when our sense of national identity becomes misplaced. Tragedy is born when we stop loving other Jews unconditionally and instead, despise them for their short comings. We feel as if another Jew’s faltering is a personal affront rather than a shortcoming to help be corrected. The pain we feel as we see another Yid do an aveira should inspire us to reach out with love and help him reconnect to Hakadosh Baruch Hu. If, however we feel his behavior makes him unworthy of being part of the Am Segula we ourselves become diminished and distanced from Hashem Yisborach. Indeed, when our sense of arvus is dependent on what is good for me rather than what is good for the Ribbono Shel Olam we are in big trouble.</p>
<p>Arvus, explains the Kli Yakar, like almost every middah, is a double edged sword. We can view cheit as loathsome but not the chotei – the sinner. Our successful application of this mantra and every Torah standard is always dependent on our outlook. Tov ayin hu yivorach – the one with the positive attitude is the recipient of blessing. We can be selfish or selfless. It simply depends on whether we are positive or negative in our perspective. As such, we are guided, when you feel Hashem is far away sing the song of Torah which Hashem Yisborach gifted us unconditionally. Realize that by looking at the goodness in others you will find the goodness in your self and be the recipient of goodness from Hakadosh Barush Hu Himself. There is no better formula to help us be zoche to a ksiva vchasima tova lanu ul’chol Yisrael.</p>
