An unidentified gunman shot several people outside a Jewish school. When Jewish people are suffering anywhere in the world, Jews all over the rest of the world suffer with them. It is a great testament to our unity and sense of camaraderie that we can feel the pain of our Jewish brethren though we have never met.</p>
<p>Death, especially sudden death, inflicts a wound upon the survivors. When a fellow Jew is killed we are all survivors. For now, the pain is being channeled into grief and connection. Jews all over the world are expressing their solidarity and love for the victims, their families, and the entire French Jewish community.</p>
<p>When Jews are killed, another reasonable reaction is to immediately assume that anti-Semitism is a factor.<span id="more-5287"></span> This is turn, gets channeled into fervent Zionism, and sometimes translates into sympathy for movements like the JDL. I can understand these sentiments. With our collective history, it is absolutely a natural reaction.</p>
<p>With regard to this recent tragedy, there is no evidence of ant-Semitism. Complicating matters further is the forensic evidence that shows that other shootings in the area in the last few days were committed using the same weapon. The other shootings targeted French paratroopers of non-Jewish ethnicity. The modus operandi was also the same. A man on a motorcycle fired shots and then sped away.</p>
<p>To my untrained mind, it seems that the same man is the shooter. If that is the case, it is even harder to see anti-Semitism in today&#8217;s horrible tragedy.</p>
<p>I think it is slightly irresponsible to blame anti-Semitism when there is none. I understand that it is a natural reaction. But anti-Semitism cannot be presumed in any and every instance where Jewish people are killed. There may turn out to be anti-Semitism in this case. But at this point, I can&#8217;t see how that can be assumed.</p>
<p>Also, slightly cringeworthy is the <em>&#8220;may God avenge their blood&#8221;</em> sentiment. We can mourn and express pain without being bloodthirsty in our expressions.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let us mourn responsibly. Let us mourn these deaths as one. We are in a deep collective pain. Let us channel that pain to improving the world and increasing love and kindness in the world to properly avenge the death of our brothers and sister in France.</p>
<p><em>May their memories be for a blessing.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/logo.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4898" title="logo" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/logo.png?resize=300%2C73" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Several online news publications reported on the YU Beacon controversy from this past week. The Beacon is a student newspaper at Yeshiva University. It is a student voice for Yeshiva College and Stern College.</p>
<p>The controversy arose from a particular article that was authored anonymously. I will not get into the details of the content of the article. Generally, it was about a young woman studying at Stern who lapsed in her observance in a hotel room with a fellow observant Jewish male. The article&#8217;s entire point was that while it may have been exhilarating, it was shameful and she was full of regret.</p>
<p>An objective reading of the article would lead to several conclusions.<span id="more-4897"></span></p>
<p>1) There is a tension in the YU community regarding intimacy before marriage.<br />
2) There are some people who breach the barriers of halacha and are intimate before marriage.<br />
3) The culture of YU does not &#8220;accept&#8221; this as normative behavior and it is considered shameful.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t find any of these conclusions to be super offensive. I don&#8217;t think they place Jews in a poor light. I don&#8217;t think they place Modern Orthodox Jews in particular in a bad light either.</p>
<p>What happened next complicated things.</p>
<p>Apparently, MANY students complained that this article was offensive. It was pulled temporarily. After a meeting between the student council, The Beacon editors and some YU administrators, the article was reposted with a disclaimer and The Beacon is now independent of YU.</p>
<p>The next level of analysis that always follows instances such as these is &#8211; Was this a kiddush Hashem or a Chillul Hashem?</p>
<p>The answer is both. And neither. Every part of the story has nuances that can be interpreted as positive and negative. Which means, that like most things controversial, it cannot be decided by one metric. I don&#8217;t use the words Kiddush and Chillul Hashem willy nilly, instead I will just use the words positive and negative. What follows is my personal analysis.</p>
<p><em>DISCLAIMERs: I am not a YU alum. I have never even been to the Yeshiva part of the University. I have been the High School twice and to the Seforim sale once. Also, I have written for The Beacon.</em></p>
<p>The article was titillating. It was in a YU publication. I think that may have been negative. A school newspaper should reflect the student body. Much of the student body does not want erotica in their newspaper. The article could have been interpreted as erotica.</p>
<p>But the message was positive. I think that is clear. The message is that we all struggle. We all feel guilty when we fail. But most of all, we all try to pick ourselves up and stay true to the values in our community based on Torah.</p>
<p>Taking down the article in response to outrage was also positive. A student newspaper should reflect the mores and mentality of the student body. When it fails to do so, it should reconsider publishing the offending material. In this case, the outrage was so severe that it warranted removal.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would have been more prudent, mature and wise not get so worked up over the article. But college students can be very headstrong. Their minds were made. I think the outrage was a negative.</p>
<p>But the end game was completely dissatisfying. The Beacon dug in its heels standing up for some moral principle and refused to back down in the face of bullies. The student council did not back down either. They forced the Beacon&#8217;s hand. Both sides were stubborn and both sides reflected negatively.</p>
<p>Where is the publicity over this? On which point is the media focusing? That is the key question. If it is simply noting the stubbornness of two student organizations then that is clearly a negative portrayal. But if the media&#8217;s focus is on the more mature and positive elements of this story, I think we can say that we are neutral at worst and positive at best. In that case, perhaps there was a Kiddush Hashem here. Perhaps.</p>
<p>As for me, I wouldn&#8217;t have published the article. I also would not have complained if the article were published.</p>
<p>A note on censorship and freedom of the press: In an environment that mixes secular and religious values as YU claims to do, sometimes one of those value systems must trump the other. If the religious value system says that publication is not wise, then you can can cry freedom of the press and marketplace of ideas as much as you want, but in the end, sometimes religion wins out. Sometimes, freedom of speech loses to restrictions of religion. I agree that a conversation about the content of the article is a good thing. I don&#8217;t know that the manner in which this article was executed was perfect nor do I think the negativity towards it was perfect either.</p>
<p>I do hope that the article will serve its purpose. I hope that it will promote discussion and discourse on this very important issue and that after all is said and done we will all emerge wiser, more devout and committed to our religious values.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/common-obama1-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4275" title="common-obama1-1" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/common-obama1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C194" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A little controversy arose when the First Lady invited several performers to the White House for an evening of poetry.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounded the invitation of a rapper named Common. The controversy was not over whether rap is actually poetry. It was about the character of this man named Common.</p>
<p>I confess, I never heard of Common before this controversy. But in October 2010 a Foxnews.com report called him a rap legend and told him &#8220;your music is very positive. And you&#8217;re known as the conscious rapper.&#8221; (See this link: <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/4380489/the-hot-zone-common/" target="_blank">Fox News</a>, as seen here:<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/201105100018" target="_blank"> Media Matters</a>.)</p>
<p>Seems like a great choice.</p>
<p>But Bill O&#8217;Reilly disagreed.<span id="more-4274"></span> It was his opinion that having Common sing at the White House was a travesty. His reasoning? Common sings a song in support of a convicted cop killer who was part of the Black Liberation Army. O&#8217;Reilly opines that anyone who sings a song like that must never be allowed to perform at the White House.</p>
<p>Jon Stewart took him to task and O&#8217;Reilly invited him to debate the issue on The O&#8217;Reilly Factor.</p>
<p>This is how it went down [watch this now if you haven&#8217;t already seen it]:</p>
<p><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4ISpkUsBYuc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4ISpkUsBYuc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></p>
<p>Stewart wins this debate. Clearly. There is a selective outrage machine in all of us. In this instance it was O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s selective outrage machine that was exposed as inconsistent if not racist.</p>
<p>It is important to note that although we may have a selective outrage machine, there are very different ways we can deal with that outrage.</p>
<p>I disagree with O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s other premise that if a man sings a song about a cop killer that defines him as a person and any further discussion of that person that does not express outrage over that song is some sort of approval of that song. In other words, just because Common sings one song about a convicted cop killer, that should not disqualify any other positive contributions he can make as as an artist or a human being.</p>
<p>Agreeing with, or celebrating, or hosting someone does not and should not mean that that person has carte blanche approval for anything and everything they do.</p>
<p>Yet this phenomena exists. It exists all over the place. One place it exists is Orthodox Judaism. Especially more insular, right wing brands of Orthodox Judaism (RWOJ).</p>
<p>Theologically and historically speaking, this is an important phenomena in RWOJ. Certain people and their opinions are acceptable, others are not. Thus, the entire life of the person is considered when deciding if their opinion can be relied upon or considered.</p>
<p>This may be important to the theology and history of RWOJ, but I find it unfortunate. Many good ideas could be lost or discarded simply because of the names of the people who thought of them. People are complex. Their ideas in one area might be wrong or unacceptable, but by acknowledging another aspect of their ideas that is not wrong and is acceptable we are not giving approval to the entire corpus of the persons previously held ideas and positions. It&#8217;s a standard that is impossible to uphold. No two people agree on everything. Inevitably everyone can be thrown under the bus for something.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not what happens. What ends up happening is exactly what happened with O&#8217;Reilly. Selective outrage.</p>
<p>In the RWOJ community it can mean that thieves or abusers are still voices that can and must be heard, but others with far less severe crimes, perhaps they wear the wrong head-covering or the wrong color suit, are marginalized and disqualified by the selective outrage machine.</p>
<p>It is completely normal to be selectively outraged. We all have biases and we all have different priorities. The problem is when the selective outrage machine also determines who has a voice and a right to be heard. Then we risk losing important ideas and contributions to our communities. There is no machine I know of that can bring those lost voices back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/koran2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3957" title="koran2" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/koran2.jpg?resize=300%2C244" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Fox News is reporting, and one of my Facebook friends is bleating, that a &#8220;Florida judge is defending his controversial decision to apply Islamic law instead of state or federal statutes in determining whether an arbitration award was correct&#8221;.</p>
<p>What this means is that a dispute arose between Muslims. It is some lawsuit about trustees on a board of a Mosque. Before the dispute, they agreed to go to &#8220;arbitration&#8221; to settle any future dispute. The arbitrator was to be an Imam and he was to be instructed to use Islamic law to settle the case. They did just that and I guess the losing party decided to give the American legal system a shot. The judge decided that the arbitration was binding and that the parties could not pursue futher litigation in the secular courts.</p>
<p>This is being portrayed as Sharia law creeping into America. For some, it is the confirmation they need that &#8220;the end is near&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fox News calls this a &#8220;controversial decision&#8221;.</p>
<p>Conservatives are pulling their hair out over this.</p>
<p>This makes me afraid.<span id="more-3956"></span></p>
<p>Orthodox Jews use a similar system of arbitration to settle disputes between Orthodox Jews. The Jewish courts apply Jewish law and are held as binding by American courts. The Jewish courts are called Beis Din and their decisions are accepted as binding arbitration by the legal system.</p>
<p>In fact, here is a quote from an Illinois appeal from someone who was excommunicated in Beis Din and sued the Beis Din for intentional infliction of emotional distress:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Plaintiff has aligned himself with this particular Orthodox Jewish community and by doing so has accepted its laws, rules and procedures. One of these laws, of which plaintiff admits he was aware, allows for excommunication where, as here, the Rabbinic Court determines that plaintiff has refused three consecutive summonses to appear before it. Because of plaintiff&#8217;s actions and knowledge of this community&#8217;s rules and practices, the actions of the Rabbinical Court of which plaintiff complains are not so outrageous as to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thomas v. Fuerst 345 Ill.App.3d 929</em></p>
<p>The secular courts are very deferential to the religious courts when the parties have agreed to use a religious court. Jews have experienced this many many times.</p>
<p>Thus, the Florida judge is doing exactly what he is supposed to do. There is no controversy here. This is not Sharia law taking over America. It is the laws of binding arbitration as applied to Islamic Law in nearly the EXACT same way it applies to Jewish Law.</p>
<p>So take a chill pill Fox News and your insane commenters.</p>
<p>Insane commenters like this one:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This judge should be removed from his seat and disbarred!There is n place in America for sharia law!If one wants to be more sharia compliant they need to pack all belongings and move to another country where these clowns are tolerated.THIS I AMERICA comply by OUR rules or get out!</em></p>
<p>Um, hello? The judge is applying American law. Got it?</p>
<p>Fair and balanced?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Glenn Beck" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.prisonplanet.com/images/september2009/150909top3.jpg?resize=371%2C182" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />I know that Glenn Beck is primarily an entertainer. I don&#8217;t think most people take him to be a scholar or expert on most important matters. He is a radio personality. He has a nice voice, a good shtick and a loyal following. Sure, I found his Nazi references ironic (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/27/glenn-beck-and-peta-in-lockstep-goose-step-on-international-holocaust-remembrance-day/" target="_blank">Glenn Beck and PETA in Lockstep (Goose Step?) on International Holocaust Remembrance Day</a>). But overall, I don&#8217;t care all that much what he has to say. In much the same way that I don&#8217;t care what more liberal entertainers have to say. It&#8217;s just entertainment.</p>
<p>But yesterday, Beck made another inane comment that made me realize something.<span id="more-3836"></span></p>
<p>First, the context:</p>
<p>Beck is talking about the 400 rabbis who took out an ad to protest his Nazi references. His point has been that these rabbis are not really religious rabbis, they are social action rabbis who don&#8217;t care about religion. Instead they &#8220;worship&#8221; liberalism. So there is no reason to take them seriously.</p>
<p>Now here is the comment:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“When you talk about rabbis, understand that most &#8212; most people who are not Jewish don&#8217;t understand that there are the Orthodox rabbis, and then there are the reformed rabbis. Reformed rabbis are generally political in nature. It&#8217;s almost like Islam, radicalized Islam in a way, to where it is just &#8212; radicalized Islam is less about religion than it is about politics. When you look at the reform Judaism, it is more about politics.”</em></p>
<p>My only real commentary on this is that the when you make an analogy you can be as broad or as narrow as you want. You could analogize the Religious Right in the GOP to radicalized Islam too. Watch this: the Religious Right in the GOP is just like radical Islam, they want to enforce a religious law on all people. See what I did there? Anyway, the test of an analogy is to see if it makes sense in any other contexts. So, do radicalized Islam and the GOP share anything else? Not really. So it&#8217;s a dumb analogy.</p>
<p>Reform Rabbis and radicalized Islam share even less.</p>
<p>Oh and FYI, Orthodox Rabbis are also plenty about politics.</p>
<p>But here is what this whole thing got me thinking: Almost a couple hundred years ago, Reform Judaism was in its infancy and was gaining traction among the young Orthodox Jews in Germany. People were jumping off the orthodox bandwagon by the dozen. It presented a real problem for the future of Orthodox Judaism. In response, two general approaches were developed. The Chasam Sofer and Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch the leaders of each. They each tried as best they could to stem the tide of those abandoning Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>No matter their tactics, it turns out that today Reform Judaism and Orthodox Judaism have very little to do with each other. Further, the bandwagons have very few people jumping back and forth between them. For almost all Jews today, there is no conscious choice between Reform and Orthodox. Most stay where they are or leave organized religion entirely.</p>
<p>My point is that practically speaking, there is no longer a battle between Reform and Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Yet, the rhetoric from both sides still sounds like it is 1860. Most Orthodox Jewish rabbis would probably agree with Beck that Reform Rabbis are not &#8220;real&#8221; rabbis. Orthodox Rabbis frequently confuse the word &#8220;Jew&#8221; with &#8220;orthodox&#8221; and basically call anyone not orthodox, not Jewish. I doubt we will see too many Orthodox Rabbis &#8220;defend the honor&#8221; of their reform counterparts.</p>
<p>(Similarly, I cannot recall hearing an Orthodox Rabbi being praised by a Reform Rabbi. It just doesn&#8217;t happen.)</p>
<p>I hereby offer my puny voice. I disagree with Beck. I think Reform Rabbis are learned, spiritual leaders and teachers who are important for the future of Judaism.</p>
<p>Really, even the most cynical of Orthodox Rabbis should agree with this. Why? Because if not for Reform Judaism, almost all secular Jews would completely lose their connection to Judaism. Isn&#8217;t it better, even from an orthodox perspective that Jews retain a Jewish identity? Marry other Jews? Contribute to the social welfare of the world? Come to shul on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur? How about every Shabbos? Advocate for Israel? Isn&#8217;t Judaism as a whole stronger if there is a reform movement?</p>
<p>I think the answer is yes.</p>
<p>I will even take it a step further. Reform Judaism challenged Rav Hirsch and the Chasam Sofer to sharpen their hashkafos and approach to Judaism. Today Reform Judaism challenges us to fine tune our observance as well (within the construct of halacha of course). Without mentioning specifics, I think it is worth noting  that Orthodox Judaism is being challenged by Reform Judaism in a good way. It&#8217;s a mild form of kinas sofrim (competition among scholars). That is also a good thing.</p>
<p>So in summary, I think Glenn Beck&#8217;s obtuse criticism of &#8220;Reformed Rabbis&#8221; is misguided. He probably thinks that all reform Jews are evil and not &#8220;really Jews&#8221; just like many Orthodox Jews. (Where would he get this from? Let&#8217;s just say there are some Orthodox Jews in his ear&#8230;) But I disagree. I salute Reform Judaism and its Rabbis. Although we may disagree about theology, we all desire for Judaism to remain strong and vibrant. Like many presumed enemies, we have much more in common than we may think and if the rhetoric is toned down, we may actually be able to work side by side (even if not hand in hand) towards our common goals.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: Beck apologized. Kind of.</strong></p>

Hardly something ripped from the headlines. This kind of thing happens all the time. But this time, the Church has come under fire for it&#8217;s friendliness.</p>
<p>The Heartsong Church in Cordova Tennessee (it&#8217;s not named after anything Muslim, calm down) allowed the local Memphis Islamic Center to use its facilities while the Islamic Center was being renovated. Church members feel it is their duty as righteous Christians to open their doors to anyone in need. These Muslims were in need of a decent place to pray and the Church was more than willing to lend a hand.<span id="more-3824"></span></p>
<p>The two groups have a longstanding relationship and share a Thanksgiving meal each year as well. Sounds like a wonderful story to me.</p>
<p>Critics are saying that this is akin to &#8220;sleeping with the enemy&#8221;. In fact (friend of Israel) Mike Huckabee has (half in jest) compared it to showing adult films in a Church. The not in jest part of Huckabee&#8217;s statement was:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“If the purpose of a church is to push forward the gospel of Jesus Christ, and then you have a muslim group that says that Jesus Christ and all the people that follow him are a bunch of infidels who should be essentially obliterated, I have a hard time understanding that.”</em></p>
<p>Well, Mr. Huckabee allow me to explain it to you. (I&#8217;m not saying I believe this. I am saying that a religious Christian would / should believe this.) First of all, maybe the members of the Church are trying to teach the Muslims about charity and love the way Jesus tried to teach those same values to people of all faiths. That seems like a nice way to teach everyone about Jesus. Second of all, these people are friends! They are not trying to obliterate each other. They are neighbors and friends and have an existing relationship!</p>
<p>Look, Huckabee is over reacting. But I think everyone that is ignoring this story is under reacting. I don&#8217;t mean reacting to Huckabee&#8217;s inane comparisons. I mean reacting to supposed enemies getting along just fine.</p>
<p>When people are friends first and religious ideologues second (or not at all), they can be friends no matter what their beliefs. When people see others as people and foster good relationships it is hard to hate them. It&#8217;s a good thing. Isn&#8217;t this the kind of Christianity and Islam that will usher in a new era of peace among all religions?</p>
<p>I think so. And I hope that we will see more interfaith relationships among people of all backgrounds, faiths and political aspirations.</p>
