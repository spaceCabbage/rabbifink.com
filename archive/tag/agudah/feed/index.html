				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was invited to join Rabbi Shafran to talk about recent comments by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and the subsequent response by the Agudah. We discussed it on Facebook on Friday and I guess Zev or one of his producers saw the comment thread and decided to ask me onto the show. The format of the show was to be a moderated discussion between Rabbi Shafran and me.<span id="more-7357"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran represented the Agudah position. I represented the non-Agudah position.<img class="size-medium wp-image-7358 alignright" alt="old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The gist of Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s argument was that Rabbi Sacks was criticizing a legitimate form of orthodox Judaism and was doing so from a place of ignorance as evidenced by his mention of the Siyum HaShas as an example of inward turning segregationism. Thus, the Agudah was standing up for themselves and the more insular communities who were criticized.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the Agudah over reacted. Rabbi Sacks was not even criticizing the insular communities as much as he was warning of a potential danger if the trend to the right continues. In his view, and in mine, there is a lot of value in a version of Judaism that sympathizes with orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Judaism should be careful not to eliminate this soft center between non-orthodox Judaism and orthodox Judaism. While the choice of the Siyum HaShas was unfortunate, I don&#8217;t think it accurately reflected his sentiments.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Rabbi Sacks meant, this is an important discussion and I invited Rabbi Shafran and the radio audience to have that discussion. While it is entertaining to argue about what Rabbi Sacks was trying to say, it is far less important than the substance his point.</p>
<p>Listen to the show below. I&#8217;ve cut the 2 hour show into 1:20 of just talking. So no ads or news will disturb your listening. The quality of the recording is pretty brutal but this was what I received from the producer.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/AzQUwt7CEAA-lB_.jpg-large.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6097" title="AzQUwt7CEAA-lB_.jpg-large" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/AzQUwt7CEAA-lB_.jpg-large-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The Twelfth Siyum HaShas was the most incredible event I have ever had the privilege of attending. The Siyum was almost perfect and I am considered a critic.</p>
<p>All kinds of orthodox Jews were there. Some were dressed in chasidic garb, others in yeshivish garb, many in professional attire, some in casual wear, others in business casual styles. Every kind of hat and yarmulka was represented. I saw them all with my own eyes. At one point everyone in the stadium was dancing and you could see circles of as diverse a group of orthodox Jews one could find. Truly, the Torah is the great equalizer and celebrating a Siyum HaShas brought (almost) all of us together.</p>
<p>Agudath Israel of America put on a spectacular show and I was greatly impressed by their production. The Siyum was as professional event I have ever attended. The speakers mostly spoke beautifully. The video tributes were slick and very well done. The music was excellent. The programs were lovely. The overall attitude and atmosphere of the Siyum was positive and filled with joy.</p>
<p>That is the way it is done. Wow.<span id="more-6096"></span></p>
<p>I want to mention a few particular specifics that made an impact on me.</p>
<p>First, the wow moment. I, like so many others, arrived late. But it was to my benefit that I arrived late. The stadium was probably 95% full when I got there and when I emerged from the tunnel to the stands, the experience of popping my head into a stadium filled to the brim with my brothers and sisters took my breath away. It was awe-inspiring. That moment brought tears to my eyes. That was before I heard a single word of Torah or a single bar of music.</p>
<p>Second, the primary speakers were outstanding. Rabbi Frand took the house down. He spoke eloquently, powerfully, and passionately. His message was that the Daf has a special power to urge us to do more and try harder in our Avodas Hashem. He ended with a great line: &#8220;Beyond your reach is within your grasp&#8221;. We can do more than we think we can do and the Daf pushes us in the right way. I was proud to share yeshiva allegiances with Rabbi Frand. It was a great moment for Ner Israel.</p>
<p>The surprise of the night for me was Rav Scheiner. I had very little prior experience with Rav Scheiner. Apparently he and my grandfather were best friends in yeshiva and he learned under my great-great grandfather from the other side, Reb Elya Lopian. Anyway, Rav Scheiner was masterful. He is a gadol from Israel but was born in America. His English was perfect (yes, he spoke in English) and his messages were timeless. He took every possible opportunity to heap praise on Rabbi Frand. It was very impressive to see a 90 year old Gadol HaDor shower Rabbi Frand with so many effusive compliments. His charisma and charm burst through his words. His genuine care and love for others was able to be felt as he spoke. His main point was that we should all try to commit to starting the Daf and that we should strengthen ourselves in unity and also learn the laws of forbidden speech to promote good will and harmony in Klal Yisrael. He was great. I hope we hear more from him in the future. A lot more.</p>
<p>Rabbi Lau was as good as expected. One can only imagine the emotion that he must feel at events like these. Here is a man who survived the death camps at the age of eight years old. He probably never thought he would survive and certainly I cannot imagine he dreamed he would ever speak before nearly 100,000 people in a football stadium celebrating seven and half years of dedicated Talmud study for the twelfth time. But that is exactly what happened and Rabbi Lau, in his inimitable style, conveyed that message along with many others.</p>
<p>Third, the video presentations were so politically correct, inclusive, and diverse. They were each very professionally produced and they did not feel amateur at all. These were super high quality videos. The attention to detail, their moments, and their universality were really very appreciated. The two gentlemen who proclaimed that they had finished Shas 5 and 6 times in the tribute to the teachers of the Daf were both from the modern Orthodox community. This willingness to step outside the yeshivaworld box made the videos even better than they would have been if they were more monolithic.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to make two observations.</p>
<p>First, I want to compare the Siyum to the Asifa. It is so much more inspirational when one stands <em>for something</em> as opposed to standing <em>against something.</em> The Siyum stands for Torah and for unity. The Asifa stood against the Internet. The impact of the Siyum, which did not ban or prohibit anything, was in my opinion several times more than the positive impact of the Asifa. You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar. The speakers spoke with smiles on their faces. The atmosphere was so positive and so optimistic that I have to believe the Siyum was very inspirational for many people. Part of the reason for that was the good attitude and pleasant spirit of the event.</p>
<p>This point could be demonstrated by comparing two statements. At the Asifa, &#8220;R’ Wachsman said that since all of Klal Yisrael is gathering together for an event, notwithstanding the fact that only a small sliver of the Jewish population was present at the Asifa, whatever edicts were initiated at the event would be binding on all Jews and if someone was not present at the Asifa, they were bound as well. Anyone who would not listen to the edicts was to be considered a defector and would lose their portion in the next world.&#8221; (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/20/the-asifa-is-done-i-was-fooled/">The Asifa is Done: I Was Fooled</a>)</p>
<p>At the Siyum, Rav Scheiner said we should take the inspiration of the evening and as Rabbi Frand suggested, we make a plan. Rav Scheiner&#8217;s suggested plan for us was that we should all try to learn a daf a day and join the Daf Yomi movement and study the writings of the Chofetz Chaim. But he emphasized several times that we should say &#8220;Bli Neder&#8221;. We shouldn&#8217;t obligate ourselves with a promise, we should just try our best.</p>
<p>Do you see the difference? I do. It&#8217;s a big difference.</p>
<p>Second, I want to talk about Agudah. The Siyum HaShas is an Agudah production. I cannot tell you how incredibly the Siyum was produced. There were very modern multimedia presentations, there was music, there were intellectually stimulating speeches, there was very little &#8220;mussar&#8221;, and zero negative energy. The Siyum used the past for perspective but focused mostly on the future. There seemed to be a concerted effort to use technology and present orthodox Judaism as modern and appealing. I give Agudah all the credit in the world for creating such a wonderful Siyum atmosphere.</p>
<p>But then I think of the Agudah Convention and I can&#8217;t help but think that it is almost impossible to believe that the two events are run by the same organization! At the conventions, orthodoxy is very narrow and the focus is on tradition and the past.  The Agudah Conventions do not resemble the Siyum at all! In fact the Siyum was so good that it might even outweigh the 7 years of Agudah Conventions between Siyums.</p>
<p>So there are two options here. Either Agudah will use this Siyum as a foundation for the future. They will embrace modernity to a certain degree and present a contemporary version of traditional orthodoxy and the convention will being to resemble the Siyum in attitude and production. Or the Siyum was an anomaly and the convention will be the same ol&#8217;, same ol&#8217;. I really, really hope it is the former. I want Agudah to be successful. I want Agudah to be relevant. I want Agudah to be the somewhat progressive, but traditionally orthodox organization it was when my grandfather was involved in the Agudah in the 50&#8242;s and 60&#8242;s. The Siyum style Agudah can be that organization. Hopefully, they will be that organization in the future.</p>
<p>The Siyum was absolutely amazing. I know I am inspired after being there. I know my son had a very special experience at the Siyum as well. I could not have asked for a better Siyum experience. Thank you Agudath Isreal of America. Next time <a href="daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">I hope to be making a Siyum along with the rest of the Daf Yomi</a> learners. And I hope you will too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mysiyum-stadium.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6089" title="mysiyum-stadium" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mysiyum-stadium-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a>The 12th Siyum HaShas will take place on August 1, 2012. The event is a massive spectacle and the orthodox Jewish community is on display. The Olympics come every 4 years. The Siyum HaShas comes around once every 7 and half years. This is a huge opportunity for positive Jewish media coverage and a chance to inspire the world.</p>
<p>Agudath Israel of America does an excellent job preparing and managing the siyum. It is easy to quibble or complain about a project of this magnitude, but overall they do a really good job.</p>
<p>Rabbis Frand and Lau are the featured speakers and they are excellent choices. These keynote speakers are moderates. That just means that the right wingers think they are too left wing and the left wingers think they are too right wing. In my opinion that is a good decision as opposed to trying to find one representative from each micro-subsection of orthodox Judaism.<span id="more-6087"></span></p>
<p>One only need look to the cornucopia of Siyum HaShas&#8217; in Israel to see how difficult Agudah&#8217;s job is and that they have been by and large successful. In Israel there are many, many siyums and most of them are sect-centric. Meaning, the attendees are mostly monolithic and &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t dare go to the other siyums&#8221;. (See the article in Haaretz linked below.) The plain fact is that in America almost all orthodox Jews go to one siyum or they join is via a satellite siyum. But it is all in the spirit of unity.</p>
<p>This is the greatest feature of Daf Yomi. The beauty of Daf Yomi is that wherever one goes, there are Jews studying the same part of the Talmud. The Torah is our most important asset as a people and Daf Yomi assists the Torah as a unifying banner under which we all pledge allegiance. It is fitting that the siyum be almost as universal as possible, bringing together the best feature of Daf Yomi and the beauty of Torah.</p>
<p>I am proud to be attending my third Siyum HaShas. One of my grandfathers took me when I was 9 years old to the siyum and my other grandfather met us there and bought me my first Gemara. Seven and a half years later I attended my second siyum with my grandfather. I was unable to attend the next siyum, but this year I will be attending. More importantly, my nine year old son will be attending his first siyum as well. My father, his grandfather, will be taking him and his other grandfather will be there as well. It comes full circle.</p>
<p>This really represents what the siyum is all about. Torah is transmitted from father to son and sometimes from grandfather to grandson as well. The siyum is not just a celebration for the dedicated daf yomi participants. It is also a monument of our dedication to Torah and Torah study. The sheer numbers of participants and the diversity of the participants is inspiring and gives us all hope for our future.</p>
<p>Many people are inspired to attempt to join daf yomi with the start of a new cycle. The siyum, a celebration of completion, somehow inspires people to redouble their efforts toward their own Talmud study. I too am inspired by the siyum and the multitude of people celebrating their personal seven and a half year journey at the siyum. I am inspired by praying with 90,000 people in one venue. I am inspired by the everyday people who have taken part in this cosmic adventure. I look forward to being present at the siyum. I look forward to celebrating with the thousands of people finishing the entire Talmud for the first or for the fiftieth time.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Agudah for doing their best to keep the celebration as universal as possible. To those who are boycotting the siyum I say, you are on the wrong side of this issue. Torah unifies us and if we are unable to come together to celebrate Torah, there is a very deep problem with your approach to Torah and Judaism. We need to unite over things we agree upon, not look with a magnifying glass to find things we disagree upon.</p>
<p>The siyum will be glorious and the people it inspires will make it worth it and then some. Let&#8217;s come together and savor this wonderful moment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5735" title="1828636222-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1-300x173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="173" /></a>One blogger at the New York Celebrate Israel Parade was so overwhelmed by the orthodox community&#8217;s involvement at the parade that she declared the future of Judaism in America to be orthodoxy. To be clear, the writer is not orthodox, but the lack of apparent vibrancy from the non-orthodox seemed to swing her vote for orthodoxy as the future of Judaism in America.</p>
<p>I happen to agree. It is extremely difficult to maintain cultural and social Judaism absent ritual and observance of Jewish law. It can be done, but it is becoming more difficult with each passing generation. The proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>The brand of orthodoxy that will prevail in America is still up for discussion. The writer of that blog post was referring to modern orthodox Judaism seeing as they are the ones she saw at the parade.</p>
<p>Another person at the parade was overwhelmed to a certain degree by the participation of the non-orthodox. This person felt that orthodoxy was not as well represented as they could and should have been. In this person&#8217;s opinion, the parade showcased non-orthodox Jews showing their passion for Israel. The orthodox Jews were like an afterthought. This person is an orthodox Jew.<span id="more-5734"></span></p>
<p>How interesting is it that two different perspectives can yield such different observations?</p>
<p>I believe that we need a combination of the two to maximize the chances of success for American Judaism. And the perfect opportunity to implement this vision is at the parade. Israel is something we all (with the exception of some fringe anti-Israel groups) can agree upon. Israel activism and AIPAC are full of orthodox Jews. Not just modern orthodox Jews. More right wing Jews strongly identify with Israel as well. The JewsNews sites report heavily on Israeli society, politics, and events. Those are sites that are read and written by right leaning (not in the political sense) orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a parade for Israel is the perfect time to march together in support of a cause and in solidarity with each other. The modern orthodox community has embraced this opportunity and marches in the parade every year. But aside from a few sporadic people from the more yeshivish side of the spectrum, the Agudah / chasidic / Lakewood communities are noticeably absent from the parade.</p>
<p>I understand that there are political concerns. I understand there may be halachic concerns as well. But I just wish we could see past those, if only for one day to stand together and do something as a united Jewish people. I just wish that for once, we could all join in unison and make a clear statement on behalf of something we all agree upon.</p>
<p>In the future of American Judaism, all Jews are able to work together on the things upon which we agree, and there are many such things. The places where we disagree will still be contested. But it will be more like two opinions from the same team as opposed to two opinions from opposing teams.</p>
<p>If we are to get there, I think the New York Celebrate Israel Parade <strong>2013</strong> is a great place to start.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s New York Times features a below the fold, front page article on sex abuse in the Hasidic community of New York. It&#8217;s usually not a good thing when orthodox Jews are on the front page of a newspaper, even below the fold. I am aware that this article reflects poorly on Hasidic Jews in particular and orthodox Jews in general. But I have to say that I found the article to be pretty fair overall and an excellent assessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Contra the article in the Forward, this article does not focus on DA Hynes (although it seems there will be an article about him tomorrow), the article in the NY Times focuses on the victims and the social pressure not to report incidents of abuse.</p>
<p>This is the real problem. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</p>
<p>The article tells the story of several victims and their families who did report the abuse to authorities only to find that they were shunned, excommunicated, or bought off. </p>
<p><span id="more-5509"></span></p>
<p>According to the article it goes all the way to the top. A family member of the Vizhnitz Rebbe in Monsey is alleged to have offered $20,000 to a victim&#8217;s family to drop charges. This is not some low level handler. This is not some shnook with a printer posting signs. This is the Grand Rebbe&#8217;s family. If that is how the leadership of thousands of Hasidic Jews handles abuse, what are we to expect from his followers?</p>
<p>Justice Guston L. Reichbach is a hero for standing up to the support of the community behind the accused and the lack of support for the victim. In court, he expressed deep disappointment with the community&#8217;s response in support of the abuser. He said there was a<em> &#8220;communal attitude that seeks to blame, indeed punish, victims.”</em> He also rebuked the multitude of Hasidic Jews in the courtroom standing in support of the abuser for writing letters in support of the defendant without a single word of <em>&#8220;any concern or any sympathy or even any acknowledgment for these young victims, which, frankly, I find shameful.”</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It was nice to see the workaround for <em>mesira</em> suggested by one rabbi, to tell a psychologist about the abuse and the psychologist will report it. This is completely unnecessary of course. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira (The Jewish Informant) in Halacha</a></p>
<p>In addition to the text of the article, there are several very interesting documents attached. Take some time to read them. They are worth investigating.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that there is no greater incidence of abuse in the ultra-orthodox community. There is just a much lower rate of reporting.</p>
<p>But the most difficult and heartbreaking part of the entire article was the quote from Rabbi Zweibel of the Agudah.</p>
<p>First of all, the Agudah has nothing to do with this. Hasidic groups could not care less what the Agudah says about sex abuse. So his quote is a non-sequitor. But he was asked his opinion and he reaffirmed with what we already know. His organization believes that a victim should go to a rabbi before going to the police. To be fair, the Agudah <em>expects </em>rabbis to be reasonable and advise bona fide victims to go to the police. However, there is little evidence that this will happen. I should also add that this is a step forward, believe it or not. It used to be that one was prohibited to go to the police at all, now one can go if a rabbi advises it. Baby steps.</p>
<p>But the worst part about what he said was this brusque comment: <em>&#8220;You can destroy a person’s life with a false report&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Absorb that for a moment.</p>
<p>The concern is that a false report could ruin someone&#8217;s life. I have two things to say about this. Both are very important.</p>
<p>First, this is built on a fallacious assumption. That is, that only rabbis have the ability to sniff out a false report and further that law enforcement is incapable of doing this task on their own. Both of this are horribly wrong. Rabbis are not trained to discern between true allegations, innuendo, and pure fabrication. Law enforcement professionals are trained to do that. They do it with regularity and with much success. Charges are not brought unless law enforcement is convinced that the abuse happened AND that it could be proved in a court of law. To say that rabbis are needed to protect innocent people who are falsely accused overstates their abilities and understates the reality.</p>
<p>But much, much, much more important is the implication of this policy. Victims of abuse have their entire lives ruined. One cannot overstate the effect of sexual abuse on a person. It haunts them every day of their life. Contemplating suicide is a normal response for a victim of abuse. It can become impossible for victims to function normally. Indeed, many victims have taken their own lives, unable to cope. Sex abuse kills. There are great rabbis who have held that an abuser is a <em>rodef</em>, a pursuer who is trying to kill someone, and anything and everything that can be done to stop them <em>must </em>be done. Sex abuse <em>destroys people&#8217;s lives.</em></p>
<p>I have <em>never </em>heard of someone who was falsely accused of a crime who committed suicide, who could not have a relationship with his or her spouse, who could not love, who could not trust, who could not cope with life. Is it an inconvenience? Absolutely. I  would not wish a false accusation on anybody. But to protect falsely accused people (which are a <em>very</em> rare occurrence) because it could ruin their life, when juxtaposed with the destruction caused by sex abuse comes off as so far removed from reality that it is scary.</p>
<p>To recap: Rabbis are not super-qualified to ascertain the truth of an accusation, law enforcement is qualified. False accusations are rare. When they occur they can harm a person&#8217;s life. To spare the falsely accused at the expense of victims is a heinous travesty of misplaced priorities. It is sick.</p>
<p>I want to end on a more positive note. My rabbis have all said that if one is a victim of abuse they <em>must </em>go to the police. These are ultra-orthodox rabbis. My point is that some rabbis get it. They were not the rabbis interviewed in the NY Times, but they are out there. <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/07/14/yadeinu-shafchu-es-hadam-hazeh/" target="_blank">As Rabbi Adlerstein wrote</a>, <em>&#8220;If your rov (rabbi) doesn’t get it, think of getting a new rov.&#8221;</em></p>
