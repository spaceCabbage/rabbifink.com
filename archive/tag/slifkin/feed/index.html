				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In anticipation of the upcoming gift giving season I have compiled a short list of books that I think would make a great gift for the orthodox Jewish Rationalist in your life. If that happens to be you, ask for an Amazon gift card and buy these books for yourself!</p>
<p><em>Get an Amazon gift card here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00067L6TQ/ref=nosim/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank">Amazon Gift Cards</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em></p>
<p>I have read all these books. I wholeheartedly recommend them. I have not done full reviews of most of these books on the blog but I have included a brief description and the rationalist significance of each of these books. I hope that if you have other books to recommend you will leave your suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>The list:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4888"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583303693/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1583303693">Masterplan: Judaism&#8211;Its Program, Meaning &amp; Goals</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Carmell, this book is based on R&#8217; Hirsch&#8217;s Horeb. It gives a framework for understanding the structure of Judaism and its commandments. It does so without using a single passage from the mystical sources. It is excellent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/190411329X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=190411329X">Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation with Mysticism</a> &#8211; Written by Menachem Kellner, this book (without saying so) debunks a common claim made by contemporary orthodox Jews. The claim is that the Rambam would have been a mysticist if only he had received the Kabbalistic Tradition. This book shows that the Rambam specifically set out to forge a rationalist path of Judaism.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00876HOFI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00876HOFI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Hashgachah Pratis: An Exploration of Divine Providence</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Aryeh Leibowitz, this book studies the various approaches to Hashgacha Pratis. There is a maximalist view that is prevalent in orthodox Judaism today. The rationalist is more likely to find meaning in the more minimalist views of the rishonim as they are documented in this book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764239/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1906764239">The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides&#8217; Thirteen Principles Reappraised</a> &#8211; Written by Marc Shapiro, this book, in convincing fashion, describes the myriad of opinions on matters of faith. Most people assume the Rambam&#8217;s 13 Principles have universal acceptance among Jewish thinkers throughout the millennium. Shapiro demonstrates that things are not so simple. Every meaningful point in this book is made with a traditional, accepted orthodox Jewish source.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143150/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1933143150">The Challenge of Creation: Judaism&#8217;s Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book is a rationalist explanation of Cosmology. This is a particularly difficult area of Torah to navigate without mysticism. Rabbi Slifkin does an excellent job in this book. All of Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s books are excellent. This is the most crucial book for rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143185/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1933143185">Sacred Monsters: Mysterious and Mythical Creatures of Scripture, Talmud and Midrash</a> &#8211; Also written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book explains the various creatures that seem too fantastical to be real. Either they were real and magical creatures exist or they were not real and magical creatures do not exist. This book takes the latter position and explains many of these passages that have troubled rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dovbear-on-the-parsha-dov-bear/1113656036?ean=9781257153367">DovBear on the Parsha</a> &#8211; Written by DovBear, I did a review of this book here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/">Book Review | DovBear on the Parsha</a>. This is a great book that opens the reader up to a world of pshat and medrash within our mesorah that does not embrace mystical interpretations. It also shows that with a little thinking and hard work, we can all contribute to Torah.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0791408027/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0791408027">In the Shadow of History</a> &#8211; Written by Chacham Jose Faur, this is book that opens one up to a Chacham Faur&#8217;s writings. I could have chosen many of his articles and books. But I believe that this is the most thought provoking of his books and articles that I have read. It is not quite an indispensable rationalist text but Chacham Faur is indispensable so I have suggested at least one of his books in this list.</p>
<p><strong>Double Bonus</strong>: Subscribe to <a href="http://www.hakirah.org/">Ḥakirah</a> and read Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s blog: <a href="%20http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/">Rationalist Judaism</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Israel-beach-BIG.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4776" title="Israel-beach-BIG" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Israel-beach-BIG.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A few days after Gilad Shalit was released from captivity he and his father spent some quality catching up time at the beach. What could more sweet? It warmed the heart to see a young man enjoy our beautiful earth in a way he might have never dreamed he ever would. Here he was tasting the intoxicating elixir of freedom and nothing could make us happier.</p>
<p>There is always someone who wants to rain on every parade.</p>
<p>In this instance, Matzav.com editorialized the story by crafting an insidious headline: <a href="http://matzav.com/photos-gilad-shalit-spends-first-free-shabbos-at-the-beach">Photos: Gilad Shalit Spends First Free Shabbos at the Beach</a></p>
<p>The implication in the headline could have been interpreted as a negative spin on a very touching moment that was recorded for time immemorial by coincidence. It appeared that Matzav was trying to fault Shalit for spending time at the beach on Shabbos.<span id="more-4775"></span> Matzav would much prefer he be in shul like his more religious counterparts. Reading the headline in this manner was borderline offensive. But Matzav further editorialized the headline by publishing dozens of specific comments that criticized Shalit, sometimes harshly for not having a religious epiphany and becoming religious following his release. Some commenters went so far to take credit for his release and took Shalit&#8217;s failure to repent as a slap in the face to them. (Sounds crazy, I know, but read the comments.)</p>
<p>Never mind the fact that they downloaded the photos from Haaretz and then superimposed their Matzav.com watermark on top of the photos. What are they nervous about? Someone is going to steal their stolen photos? So myopic, it is amazing.</p>
<p>At the time, I was offended. But I figured it is not worth writing a post about a few knucklehead commenters on a fringe orthodox website.</p>
<p>But now I read that a Knesset Member from the Shas party recently made similar criticism of Gilad Shalit.</p>
<p>What is with these people?</p>
<p>Do they not understand that many very passionate Jews are not observant in the same way they are? Do they not realize that not being born into that kind of home makes it nearly impossible for one to flip a switch and become orthodox? Do they think that by yelling and screaming these insane complaints about not observing Shabbos as they would like, Gilad Shalit is going to start observing Shabbos the way they would like?!</p>
<p>Further, going to the beach on Shabbos might not even entail a single biblical or even rabbinic prohibition! He may have observed Shabbos after all! But insulting people, making people feel badly, especially people who have suffered for the simple fact that they are a Jew <em>is</em> a severe prohibition. The priorities here are so skewed that it almost seems satirical!</p>
<p>If an MK or a Matzav commenter want to have a conversation with Gilad Shalit and try and impress upon him the importance or the beauty of keeping Shabbos by all means, go right ahead. But to publicly criticize the poor guy for doing as he always did on his first weekend home is so far from how a Jewish person should treat a fellow Jew, let alone a Jewish hero.</p>
<p>It hurts me that my co-religionists have become so insulated and so one track minded that it has become acceptable to speak this way. I am embarrassed and I hope that this is the voice of a few knuckleheads and does not reflect the overall attitude of the orthodox Jewish community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/imposter.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4132" title="imposter" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/imposter.jpg?resize=300%2C229" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Ami Magazine has an article about orthoprax Jews. I&#8217;m not one to complain about tone, so I won&#8217;t complain. I will just note for the record that the tone of the article is incredibly demeaning to anyone who has ever contemplated the limits of religious belief and the article sounds more like a scathing editorial than a piece of journalism.</p>
<p>In order to understand this blog post <strong>it is necessary that you read the Ami Magazine article</strong> which is available here: <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/52858246/Ami-Magazine-April-6-2011-The-Impostors-Among-Us" target="_blank">The Impostors Among Us</a>. Come back here when you are done.</p>
<p>The concept of orthopraxy is a simple one. Act like an orthodox Jew but reject some or all of the beliefs of orthodox Judaism. To the author of this article, these people are impostors and the biggest threat to orthodox Judaism that exists.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with the article is the approach taken with regard to orthopraxy in general.<br />
<span id="more-4130"></span>In the eyes of the author, one who questions their core beliefs as an Orthodox Jew is literally sick. Either emotionally scarred or intellectually weak describes the types of people who are orthoprax. The assumption is that any sane, intelligent person would obviously conclude that the core beliefs of orthodox Judaism are correct. Further, those beliefs are to believed in their most absolute fundamental form.</p>
<p>However, the article does not, in any way shape or form, actually address the complaints that orthoprax Jews raise against those beliefs. It just assumes that those beliefs are reasonable. To me, this is representative of the flaws that created this problem and the incomptence within the fold in dealing with these issues.</p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism requires certain beliefs. The article, and most orthodox Jews I know, assume that these beliefs are obvious, logical, reasoned conclusions. They possess this belief because they have not been presented any evidence to the contrary. And if they have been presented evidence to the contrary it has been tainted and manipulated by apologists who spin the evidence as non-compelling while only presenting half-truths. Thus, when the soon-to-be-orthopraxer actually is presented with real evidence or questions that poke holes in the once so compelling logic of the orthodox Jewish beliefs, the house of cards comes crashing down.</p>
<p>The primary defense against the destructive nature of this information has been seclusion. This defense (as the article calls it, I wouldn&#8217;t call it a defense) is not a defense at all. It is avoiding the problems. When someone avoids a problem or skirts an issue the natural reaction is to believe that there is no real answer, there is no solution, the questions are too powerful and the previously held beliefs are not defensible. The next reasonable step is to lose faith in the system.</p>
<p>It is not an illness. It is not the result of emotionally damaged psychosis. It is normal.</p>
<p>If we believe that we possess some sort of truth, then we can&#8217;t be afraid of other truths. If we are hiding from other truths, it betrays our lack of confidence in our truth. This kind of hypocrisy and closed-mindedness is what causes people to drop their beliefs. Not disease.</p>
<p>The trick is to realize that this is the problem. Once this is established the beginnings of some solutions are not too far out of reach.</p>
<p>The article suggests attending &#8220;emunah workshops&#8221;. There cannot be a worse idea. First of all, emunah is entirely inappropriate a word for these workshops. They are not teaching emunah, faith. They teach quasi-intellectual proofs (which mostly have counter proofs or flaws) in order to prove the divinity of the Torah or the existence of God. These are the very &#8220;proofs&#8221; that lead to orthopraxy. They reek of chicanery and feel like mind games. If you ask a question that derails the flow, again, the whole house of cards comes crashing down. If one tries to prove something and the proof fails miserably, one is worse off than if one had not tried to prove it at all. It makes the one trying to do the proving look like a snake oil salesman. No one intelligent is going to buy snake oil.</p>
<p>Instead, I think, the solution should be an expanded, more liberal interpretation of Torah M&#8217;Sinai and God. The system needs to give leeway for the varied opinions throughout our tradition that take less of a hard line approach. Don&#8217;t build that massive house of cards. Try to reintroduce the valid opinions of our great sages that are more compatible with evidence that we now have. That&#8217;s not to say that those who had opinions that don&#8217;t comport with what we know today were wrong. They were doing the best they could with the information they had. We should strive to do the same.</p>
<p>Further, there is nothing wrong and there is no reason to attach a stigma to those who have questions. Orthodox Jewish beliefs are not necessarily logical conclusions. Assuming they are and assuming that one who does not reach those same conclusions is a handicapped person, fosters an environment where orthopraxy is sometimes the only choice. But if allowing ourselves to have unresolved questions would be an acceptable place within orthodox Judaism, fewer people would feel the need to jump ship.</p>
<p>The article implies that these impostors must be rooted out and exposed. This is offensive to me. I am sure plenty of great people throughout our storied history have questioned their beliefs. After all, the Rambam wrote a &#8220;Guide for the Perplexed&#8221;. Some people must have been perplexed! I am even more certain that many great people had a parent or two who may have questioned their beliefs. It is also likely that some who questioned, eventually rejected. But I am sure many others either resigned to not knowing or found some satisfaction in the answers they discovered. By exposing, stigmatizing and rooting out anyone who questions their beliefs we are playing with fire. People change their ideas throughout their lives and many who don&#8217;t can still raise children who can sustain their own beliefs and be successful orthodox Jews. Ruining lives and shunning people who don&#8217;t think the same way others think is a witch hunt of the worst kind. How can others measure the thoughts of a peer? Thoughts are not measurable by man. Only actions are. <em>(On the importance of action versus thought I recommend Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s post: <a href="http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2011/04/ominous-treacherous-infiltrators.html">Ominous, Treacherous Infiltrators?</a>)</em></p>
<p>I believe there is one more area of contemporary orthodox Judaism that significantly contributes to orthopraxy. That is the abundance of mysticism within our community. There are people who are skeptics. It is their nature. These people are not intrigued or impressed with mysticism. If it is not logical or scientific it simply doesn&#8217;t appeal to them. However, the Judaism of Rambam or R&#8217; Hirsch <em>would</em> be very appealing to them. Judaism of 2011 may not. Mysticism requires suspension of disbelief. It is easy to see how one can conflate the unnecessary belief in mysticism with the necessary beliefs of orthodox Judaism. Stop believing (or never believing) in one leads to the other. Making mysticism such an integral part of orthodox Judaism will have a negative affect on those who are skeptics and unnecessarily so. The Judaism of Rambam and R&#8217; Hirsch was passionate and deep without many of the things that would turn a skeptic away from Judaism. I believe that part of the problem is that too much suspension of disbelief can turn some of our best and brightest into sacrifices burned at the altar of mysticism.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the Internet. The article suggests that the Internet is to blame for orthopraxy. While this might be partially true, it does not exonerate the community for pushing these people out. The lack of preparation for discovering new information, the level of misinformation that is taught and the expectation that no one will ever find anything that contradicts the party line are all just as much to blame, if not more, than the actual information that bursts these bubbles.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>There are many other ways to approach this article. I believe there are other flaws in the article as well. I have chosen to highlight some of the issues I feel need addressing and may not be addressed by others.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/presumed-guilty-poster.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4092" title="presumed-guilty-poster" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/presumed-guilty-poster.jpg?resize=214%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This item will not surprise orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>We all know how great a ban can be for business. Just ask Rabbi Nosson Kamenetsky or Rabbi Natan Slifkin how their sales were after their books were banned. Their books became collectors items!</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise that a documentary film banned by the Mexican government is soaring in popularity. The film is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/presumedguilty/" target="_blank">Presumed Guilty</a>&#8221; and I have not seen it yet. So whatever I am writing is based on what I have read and heard from others.</p>
<p>The film is banned because it exposes the Mexican judicial system as a sham. Not only are the trials and proceedings full of injustices, the prison system is equally woeful and inhumane. The protagonist of the film has been excluded as a suspect by all forensic evidence, he has a legitimate alibi and the witness to the crime could not identify him. Yet, he was convicted and re-convicted in a corrupt legal system.</p>
<p>To avoid the embarrasment and the cries to reform the system, Mexico declared the movie illegal and its claims do not need to be addressed.<span id="more-4090"></span></p>
<p>The ban is always used in the same way. To avoid the substantive claims in a book or movie, authority dismisses the book or movie as illegal. That way they don&#8217;t have to deal with the claims.</p>
<p>Luckily, people are smarter than that. When something is banned, people want to know why. They want to know what was so offensive that deserved a ban. Usually, the contraband is found compelling and the people see through the veiled attempt by the authority to pretend that the flaws or issues in their own systems need addressing. If something is ban-worthy, it is probably making good points.</p>
<p>In the case of this movie, it is a point about justice.</p>
<p>In the cases of Rabbis Kamenetsky and Slifkin it was about the fallibility and humanness of rabbinic leaders.</p>
<p>All these examples make great points. If they are wrong, I would love to hear why. I would love to see some evidence to the contrary. But when something is banned and response is not necessary. A ban is the ultimove sign of weakness in authority. When their only defense is &#8220;you can&#8217;t see what they have to say about us&#8221;, their defense is not a defense at all.</p>
<p>The ban on Presumed Guilty has been lifted for the time being. It is back in theaters and DVD sales are soaring. For now&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tolerance.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3169" title="Tolerance" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tolerance.jpg?resize=289%2C289" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In the comment threads that follow the two posts I wrote about Esther Petrack (who has been eliminated from ANTM) (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/16/esther-petrack-modern-orthodox-jewish-girl-on-americas-next-top-model-drops-shabbos-on-television/">Esther Petrack: Modern Orthodox Jewish Girl on America’s Next Top Model Drops Shabbos on Television</a> and <a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/2010/10/19/esther-petracks-mother-speaks-esther-is-observant-it-was-all-editing/">Esther Petrack&#8217;s Mother Speaks: Esther is observant, it was all editing</a>) I noticed something that I feel needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>Much of the conversation was about whether Esther could be considered &#8220;Orthodox&#8221; or &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; in light of her decision to model. The first comment thread assumed that she dropped Shabbos (even though we knew it could be editing and my post was not about her per se) and the second thread assumed that even if she kept Shabbos there was a problem with her modeling.</p>
<p>Quite a few commenters found the need to &#8220;draw a line&#8221; between what they do and what Esther did. Some said she desecrated God&#8217;s name. Others said that violated a law and not being ashamed is enough for them to be ousted from orthodoxy or modern orthodoxy. I debated the merits of those claims on the thread (and even received a number of emails thanking me) and I don&#8217;t care to debate them further.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is this need that has been expressed to self define by whom we exclude.<span id="more-3168"></span></p>
<p>This phenomena is part of what drove the &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; laws of the first half of the 20th century. Sure blacks couldn&#8217;t be used as slaves anymore, but by excluding them from social life, and certain privileges the white majority still felt superior.</p>
<p>In politics you&#8217;ll see the same kind of lines of demarcation drawn. Someone is only as right or left wing as they are compared to the next guy. So political groups find it necessary to define themselves by who and what they are not. The last two major election campaigns (&#8217;08, &#8217;10) both focused on change. &#8220;We are not like them&#8221;.</p>
<p>In religions it is the same way. Folks want to feel superior or more authentic so they say &#8220;we are the REAL ____ [Jews / Christian / Muslims (/ Atheists)]. Huge sects of Christianity and Islam are built on this principle. Judaism is smaller and has been united by common persecution so these tendencies may have existed but it did not yield similar results.</p>
<p>Once Jews were freed from the ghetto this phenomena found its way into Judaism. Different sects within Judaism formed and people began to define themselves by whom they were not like. Most people do what their parents do. It wasn&#8217;t a conscious choice, yet they self define &#8220;real Judaism&#8221; as their version. And their version can be so narrowly construed that no one else can fit in to their little world. It&#8217;s isolationism at its best.</p>
<p>This is what many Modern Orthodox Jews find so disturbing about Charedi Judaism. The Charedi establishment excludes non-conformists. This includes in action and in thought. For example Rabbi Natan Slifkin performs the same actions / mitzvos as the Charedim. But he is excluded for his thoughts. On the other hand, those who look the part but don&#8217;t act like Charedi Jews are also excluded. For some (maybe most) this doesn&#8217;t affect them because they have self selected themselves out of the Charedi world. But for Rabbi Slifkin who self selected himself as a Charedi Jew, this created a personal conflict. Subsequent to the entire affair he self excluded himself. The merits of Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s opinions and the merits of the Charedi criticisms are not relevant. The point is that he was excluded for his thoughts.</p>
<p>Modern Orthodox Jews are more inclusive. There is a broader range of activity and thought that is acceptable. But when someone so much as tiptoes over the line they are out. Rabbi Avi Weiss dared tread just across the line and everyone and their grandmother has &#8220;excluded&#8221; him or proclaimed him to be &#8220;beyond the pale&#8221;. The truth is that Modern Orthodoxy is more inclusive but only because they have a broader definition of what is acceptable thought and action. However, going outside that self-defined perimeter means you are outside Modern Orthodoxy. There is not more tolerance, just more tolerated activity.</p>
<p>The same thing drove the comments that ousted Esther Petrack from Modern Orthodoxy. Esther&#8217;s mother wrote that her family goes &#8220;mixed swimming&#8221; (and wear bathing suits in public). This is an accepted action within Modern Orthodoxy. (Forget halacha for a minute, this is a social issue, not a halachic issue.) Yet, Esther&#8217;s modeling was outside what some people want to define as Modern Orthodoxy so she is out. Esther self defines as Modern Orthodox. Somehow people think they have a right to tell others how they are to be defined.</p>
<p>How does it help Modern Orthodox Jew be a better person or a better Jew by excluding Esther? What is the motivation?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same phenomena. People need to feel better about themselves and they take the feel good shortcut by telling themselves and others that they are better / more important / more religious / more privileged than someone else.</p>
<p>Isolating others from the place that they define as their place is self serving. Further it can hurt others. Esther is 18 years old. If you care about her as your sister and you want her to be successful professionally and more importantly, spiritually then you would be best served offering her support and reminding her that we are her family no matter what.</p>
<p>Teens who are at-risk are the darlings of the Orthodox Jewish community. Money, time, resources, blog posts and magazine articles are dedicated to solving their problems. Do we hear anyone trying to exclude them from the places they want to be included? Of course not. I am not equating at risk teens and Esther. All I am saying is that even we have come to understand that inclusion is a much more powerful tool than exclusion.</p>
<p>This is not just about Esther. It is about being inclusive. Halacha tells us how to act. It doesn&#8217;t tell us to exclude those who may not follow halacha to the standards that we arbitrarily create.</p>
<p>Above all else: V&#8217;ahavta l&#8217;reyacha kamocha, zeh klal gadol baTorah.</p>

<p>The article is a Boston Globe piece and is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/04/11/the_unbelievers/?page=full">The Unbelievers</a>&#8220;. I recommend reading the entire article as this post will just highlight a few parts of the well researched article to illustrate some points of interest to this audience.</p>
<p>Lately, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk of Orthopraxy within the Orthodox Jewish world. See my post: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/11/the-real-orthoprax-issue/">The Real Orthoprax Issue</a>. There are even some blogs dedicated to its theology (and challenging the traditional OJ theology). Interestingly, the Orthoprax people I know of (NOT Orthoprax by default) are lay people. Not Rabbis.<span id="more-2367"></span> True, they are very learned and could probably pass as rabbis, but they remain lay people. Though I wonder if there are &#8220;closet Orthoprax Rabbis&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>According to this article, there are significant clergy members of various Christian denominations that for all practical purposes are &#8220;Orthoprax Christians&#8221;. They value the rituals, the connection with others, the music, but they don&#8217;t believe their religion&#8217;s theology. They don&#8217;t believe in God.</p>
<p>When comparing ministers and Christianity with Rabbis and Judaism there is a marked difference. Almost all Orthodox Jews spend several years of Torah study. Many lay people in the OJ community are more learned than their Rabbis. The article led me to believe that it is highly unlikely that lay people in the Christian community would be &#8220;Orthoprax Christians&#8221; because they don&#8217;t know enough about the Bible and Christianity for the gaping holes, flaws and problems to bother them. But the educated class, the clergy, is susceptible to disbelief because they know what the problems are</p>
<p>Cynics have said that the reason for &#8220;Daas Toyrah&#8221; ousting rationalism and &#8220;Slifkinism&#8221; from the &#8220;mesorah&#8221; is to keep the public ignorant so that they won&#8217;t revolt against the rabbis. Perhaps there is some truth to that cynical belief. Ignorance will definitely keep people in line. It also shows is a complete lack of confidence in Torah.</p>
<p>Reading through the article I noticed little things that are virtually the exact ideas that Orthoprax Jews talk about. One idea is the &#8220;more benign forms of religion&#8221;. That is a religion without God. It takes the moral aspects of religion and the rituals but divorces them from divinity and yet brings people together. Another idea is the issue of who wrote the Bible. Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t usually struggle with this. But those who are aware of the issues, do.</p>
<p>In short, this article is not written about Jews. But it very likely could have been. It seems to me that there is nearly endless room for discussion about the questions it raises for us. I urge you to read the article and think about how it makes you feel.</p>
<p>The article made me feel confused about how I feel. How about you?</p>
