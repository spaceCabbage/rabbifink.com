				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7062" alt="174928094" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a>MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is ruffling the feathers of many charedi Gedolim in Israel and America. It seems there are two levels to the rhetoric against MK Lipman.</p>
<p>Primarily, I think many have a problem with him by dint of his association with MK Yair Lapid. It is an article of faith that Lapid is anti-charedi and since MK Lipman is a member of MK Lapid&#8217;s party he is guilty by association. I don&#8217;t think it would be possible to support Yesh Atid and have charedi approval.</p>
<p>Secondarily, many have a problem with MK Lipman&#8217;s positions. I think that his positions are perceived as anti-charedi and therefore anti-Torah. In particular, supporting a requirement that save for specific instances, all charedim participate in the army or national service and join the workforce instead of a blanket exemption for all charedim from service. MK Lipman also supports requiring a basic secular education for all Israelis, no exceptions. By the way, he also supports a better Jewish education for all Israelis, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care to discuss whether charedim are truly the most authentic orthodox Jews or whether they are corrupting Judaism. That&#8217;s a discussion for another time. I want to discuss the reaction of American charedim to MK Lipman&#8217;s proposals.<span id="more-7060"></span></p>
<p>In Israel, a charedi is identified by several social and religious markers. I list them here in no particular order, nor is this list exhaustive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Manner of dress. Charedim wear black and white, sport felt or fur hats, and shun modern style of dress like jeans or T-shirts.</li>
<li>Fear of God. Charedim place God and religion above all else. The word of God is supreme.</li>
<li>Daas Torah. Charedim extend their fealty to the word of God beyond the words of the Written Torah, and even beyond the Oral Law, to include the words of the great rabbis and treat their words like the word of God.</li>
<li>Torah learning is the ultimate service of God. Working for a living is not ideal at best and is actively avoided at worst.</li>
<li>No secular education. Charedim send their children to private schools which do not teach anything that is not found in the Torah.</li>
<li>Rejection of Zionism. The State of Israel is not recognized as a positive development for the Jewish people. It is more likely described as a problem than a solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is your Israeli Charedi checklist.</p>
<p>However in America, people who consider themselves charedi use a different set of parameters.</p>
<p>I think that American charedim subscribe to 1-3, but not necessarily 4-6. The only people in America who truly hold of 4-6 would be chasidim and not all chasidim would agree with 4-6 either. Certainly, many chasidim do not agree with #4 and in America even the chasidic communities are required to give a basic (not sufficient) secular education.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter?</p>
<p>It seems to me, that American charedim are more similar to MK Lipman than they are to Israeli charedim. It is conceivable that MK Lipman could word his platform a little bit differently and still mean the exact same thing. He could say &#8220;I want Israeli charedim to be like American charedim&#8221; and the practical ramifications would be strikingly similar.</p>
<p>I think MK Lipman would be thrilled if Israeli charedim were like Lakewood charedim. They get a secular education, they work (eventually), they even support the State of Israel to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Yet, American gedolim and charedim in America continue to malign MK Lipman and his platform. I don&#8217;t get it. All he is saying is that Israeli charedim should be more like American charedim! He wants them to be like us! They should be flattered. Not insulted!</p>
<p>R&#8217; Ahron Feldman is a Rosh Yeshiva of a yeshiva that is precisely what MK Lipman wants for Israeli charedim and yet he severely criticizes MK Lipman going so far as to call him a rasha. It doesn&#8217;t add up. If what we have in America is good why is it not good for our brothers and sisters in Israel? And even if what they have could be conceived of as better, it&#8217;s not so terrible to be like the American charedim, is it?</p>
<p>True, the two groups share one name &#8211; Charedim. But they are different types of charedim!</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is complicated. Army service can be difficult for charedim. We can understand the reluctance to become less insular and take time away from Torah study. These are reasonable critiques of the sweeping proposals being discussed right now. But let&#8217;s be reasonable. We can talk about the issues and figure out the best way to deal with them.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that there are some potential problems with MK Lipman&#8217;s plan. It&#8217;s not easy to just throw away the old system. There are going to be complications. But I think we will be far more successful if we work together. The plan is not to turn charedim into secular Zi0nists. How about just acting more like American charedim? Seems to me that it should be a workable solution.</p>
