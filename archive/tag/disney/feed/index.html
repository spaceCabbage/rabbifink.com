				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s talk about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/17/inside-out-movie-review-and-analysis/">Inside Out</a> again. But this time we are not just going to talk in the superficial, “go see it” kind of way we did last time. Now it’s time for real talk.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Storytelling and Canvas Building</strong></span><br />
Movies can be diversions or just pure entertainment, but sometimes movies can be so much more. There are movies that illustrate grand important ideas in a new way that pushes culture and society forward. To me, this is the peak of storytelling. When the story itself is not really the thing the story is saying, because the thing the story is saying is so much bigger than the story, we experience a sort of storytelling magic.</p>
<p>Too often, fiction undermines reality. I’ll never forget this quip from Rabbi Tendler during a private study session. <em>“If you expect marriage to be the way marriage is portrayed in novels and films, you’re going to be waiting a long time for the violins.”</em> In context, he was teaching me that relationships take work and popular culture is not very good at real relationships. Generally, we watch saccharine caricatures of real life with simple resolutions, over-emphasis on raw feelings, and of course, violins.</p>
<p>I love when fiction does not try to rewrite reality. I love when fiction tells us something about reality. Done right, a movie can be a powerful storytelling device that helps us to understand and deal with reality. Fiction can be real.<span id="more-9321"></span></p>
<p><strong><u>A Movie of Biblical Proportions</u></strong><br />
Inside Out is not a very interesting story. There’s no villain, except maybe “the passing of time” and most of the story happens inside the head of an 11 year old girl named Riley. A lot of people seem to think that the movie is about the voices inside Riley. But the movie is not about the voices inside Riley’s head at all. They are just part of the canvas the real story of Inside Out is painting.</p>
<p>The brilliance of Inside Out is its lesson. Its mini lessons along the way are amazing. The way it teaches its lessons, using its internal metaphors and symbolism, is much more than brilliance, it is almost Biblical.</p>
<p>I think the primary lesson of Inside Out is profoundly simple. We have all been misled to believe that happiness is the cumulative feeling of avoiding pain, sadness, misery, and doubt. That is a lie. Happiness and joy are not the absence of bad experiences at all. In fact, without negative experiences, there is no joy. Children are not mature enough to understand this sophisticated point even if it is taught directly. Children deal with emotions and feelings in a very binary way. Things are either good or bad.</p>
<p>The real world is not like this at all.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/24/growing-up-what-religion-can-learn-from-the-magic-of-inside-out/insideout-640/" rel="attachment wp-att-9325"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9325" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/insideout-640.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="insideout-640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Everything in our lives is a complex cocktail of contributory emotions. A little bit happy, a little bit sad, a little bit angry, a little bit worried, a little bit thrilled, and all at different levels. The first time we feel these complexities, it can be disconcerting. Adolescents are often brooding, moody, unpredictable, and sometimes their personalities are very different than they were as children. Part of that is the discomfort with encountering reality and perhaps even the real self. Inside Out is a parable that helps us understand the challenge of growing up from a child to an adult.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The New &#8216;A Separate Peace&#8217;</strong></span><br />
The fear and loathing of meeting one’s real self is the theme of one of my favorite books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743253973/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0743253973&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=ZWOK3ZIBBJ3RR5JF">A Separate Peace</a>. It’s a mediocre story, but the story is not really the thing the story is saying. A Separate Peace is about adolescence, and facing one’s true self. That’s what it’s really about.</p>
<p>Inside Out is working on a different angle. The movie is helping us be honest with ourselves about what really makes us happy. Inside Out shows us that the best feelings and best emotions are a mixture of joy, anger, disgust, fear, and even sadness. In fact, Joy was only able to return to Riley because of Sadness. Acknowledging our sadness gives us the opportunity for happiness, not avoiding sadness. It wasn’t only Sadness, it was also letting go of childhood by saying goodbye to her imaginary childhood friend, Bing Bong. It’s counterintuitive at first, but just past the initial superficial level, lies this obvious truth. There is no happiness without sadness and there is no growing up without letting go of childhood.</p>
<p>These ideas are almost glibly demonstrated during Inside Out. But don’t let the simplicity of the way Inside Out teaches its lessons fool you into thinking these are not sophisticated and meaningful teachings.</p>
<p>Once Riley’s feelings are able to work together to craft more meaningful memories, their control panel console grows. Children only experience one feeling at a time and only one feeling can be in charge at any given moment. When we grow up, each feeling has a seat at the table and they all work together instead of jockeying for control. This is the primary lesson of Inside Out.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some Bonus Lessons</span></strong><br />
Along the way, Inside Out creates a magnificent storytelling device that gives the writers opportunities to teach so many more lessons that are tangential to the story. Inside Out sees our memories as sources of power for several islands in Riley’s brain. Each island represents a fundamental group of memories and experiences that Riley “visits” during nostalgic moments. The internal logic of the movie kicks Joy and Sadness out of Riley consciousness following a traumatic experience. Joy and Sadness find themselves marooned far away from headquarters. Their path back to headquarters is along the connection between headquarters and the islands. As Riley destroys her islands by poisoning her memories with rebellion, the path through Family Island remains Joy’s last hope. But when Riley kills Honesty Island, the paths to headquarters are all gone. I thought this was an incredible, subtle message about the importance of honesty. As long we are honest with others and ourself there is a path back.</p>
<p>Another amazing lesson was perhaps the most explicit moral of all. Bing Bong is feeling very sad and Joy tries every trick in the book to cheer him up. She is doing everything she can do to overpower Bing Bong’s sad feelings with her intense joy. It does not work. Sadness sits down next to Bing Bong and just listens to him tell her how he feels. Sadness tells him that she totally understands why he is sad and offers a hug and shoulder to cry on. That works. Joy is flabbergasted. Sadness explains that she saw he was sad so she just wanted him to know that she understands.</p>
<p>Later in the movie, Riley and her parents share a tender moment when they are honest with each other about how they feel. No one tries to fix their sadness or anxiety. They simply hear each other and enjoy a loving family hug.</p>
<p>Too often, we think the way to help a sad friend is to cheer them up. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/05/fixing-shiva/" target="_blank">But I think it’s always more helpful to just listen, understand, and offer a warm hug and shoulder to cry on</a>.</p>
<p>There are many additional teachings sprinkled though Inside Out. A few memorable moments stand out. My favorite might be when a box labeled “Opinions” and box labeled “Facts” spill over and the contents get mixed up. &#8220;Oh no!&#8221; exclaims Joy, &#8220;these facts and opinions look so similar!&#8221; &#8220;People are always getting these mixed up,&#8221; says Bing Bong. Indeed, they do.</p>
<p><strong><u>Who Cares?!</u></strong><br />
Why am I talking about Inside Out? Is there a point to all this?</p>
<p>Good question. Yes, there is a point to all this Inside Out talk. Two major points, in fact. One from the negative perspective and one from a positive perspective.</p>
<p>We are all Riley. Those of us are religious Rileys have an additional island of memories in our brain. Religious Riley has Religion Island. That’s where all our religious memories live. For most children, Religion Island should be pretty sweet. Kids love religion. It’s fun. The stories are interesting. The food is familiar. You spend more time with parents and family. Religion Island is awesome when you’re a kid. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">I think it&#8217;s important to actively create this sweetness for our families and communities</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Religious Trauma</span></strong><br />
Inside Out showed us how trauma shatters our childhood islands. When pain and sadness infect our religious nostalgia, we are destroying Religious Island. Some trauma is a direct result of religious experience and other trauma is unrelated to the religious experience. Any trauma can wreck Religion Island. This can happen even against our own wishes.</p>
<p>Religious leaders who seek to hide or inhibit public conversation about religious leaders who stumble or other flaws in their community, for fear of encouraging religious reprisal., or worse, are missing the point. It’s not the knowledge of bad behavior that harms people, it’s the trauma itself. Trauma severs the relationship between the person and the positive memories. Hearing about it does not do that at all. I think the Religious Island Destroyed by Trauma metaphor severely undermines the strategy of silencing criticism or victims of abuse.</p>
<p>More importantly, it explains why most of the people who leave their religious communities, don&#8217;t find comfort in a less strict religious community. Their religious island is gone. This new place is not the old place. The new place feels fraudulent and fake. <a href="http://zeek.forward.com/articles/117822/" target="_blank">The trust is gone</a>. But that does not mean it&#8217;s the end of the story.</p>
<p>There is also something incredible hopeful about the way Inside Out portrayed how Riley <em>rebuilt</em> her islands. True, the islands were completely useless following the trauma Riley experienced. But the movie shows us those islands restored and thriving even more than they were before they were broken. We also see added complexity to Riley’s islands and they are being powered by the new core memory cocktails of mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Often enough, people want to rebuild their dilapidated or broken religious islands. Somehow, Religion Island was destroyed for them at some point.  Eventually, they might want to reassemble their religious islands. But reconstruction is not possible using those old simple memories that are generally good. The cotton candy version of religion is gone for these people, but <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/11/rising-from-the-ashes-of-bad-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">building something new, with complexity, embracing ambiguity, and engaging in their struggles, is absolutely available</a>. It takes work, but it might be worth the effort.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consciousness and Construction</span></strong><br />
I think most conscious people have had their dreamlike childhood memories smashed. They might have felt real in the moment, but they are not reality. The real world is complex and confusing and contradictory. Real lasting relationships are built out of mixed core memory cocktails. Relationships between us and our spirituality, between us and our religion, between us and our community, our family, our spouse, our parents, our children, and ourselves, all can function, blissfully unaware, in rainbow, lollipop, and unicorn mode. In that mode, they are super fragile and they might collapse in a quick heap. But all our relationships function on a much higher level if we are conscious of the relationship and its complexity. They improve, when the parties to a relationship make the effort to build after something has been broken.</p>
<p>This secret to living is the soul of one important message in Inside Out. It&#8217;s applicable to religion, but it&#8217;s just as applicable to friendship, courtship, marriage, self awareness, and any other relationship. We start with only childish nostalgia. It might break one day and that will hurt, a lot. But moving past our childish nostalgia is not bad or evil, it&#8217;s just growing up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about time too. After all those years of hinting to us that we should try to just be a kid and stay young forever, Disney Pixar is telling us that it&#8217;s also time to grow up &#8211; from the inside, out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disney Pixar movies are cultural events in our world. No studio is as careful with their product and as successful with their product as Pixar. Yet, my anticipation level for their latest film, Inside Out, far exceeded previous expectations. I was a little concerned that I was setting myself up for disappointment. A few hours ago, I saw an early screening of Inside Out and it was the greatest movie I have ever seen. The after-movie <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10102813803182695">feeling was like Interstellar</a>, only more intense.</p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with the premise of the film. We interact with the main character on two levels. Riley is our 11 year old hero on the surface level, but the movie also tells its story from the perspective of her feelings. We meet her Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust as they work together to give Riley the best emotional experience. That&#8217;s the part everyone knows, but that&#8217;s not really what the movie is about.</p>
<p>The movie is actually a coming of age story. It&#8217;s not so much about Riley&#8217;s emotions, as much as it is about how Riley&#8217;s emotions as a child are completely different from the emotions that come as she reaches her teenage years. This is the note Inside Out plays so magnificently. The story of Riley&#8217;s feelings takes the first 25 minutes of the film. It is spectacular. I was grinning from the first moment and crying from the second. Inside Out is an emotional roller coaster and the first act of the film is a steady barrage of sweetness peppered with punches to the gut. I loved it, but it was intense.<span id="more-9304"></span></p>
<p>Luckily, Inside Out is also hilarious. We are treated to plenty of the customary slapstick humor as well as high brow comedy that strikes just the right balance of subtle humor and insight into the characters.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/17/inside-out-movie-review-and-analysis/40089bd8a3615c0db500adc387c0794a_xl/" rel="attachment wp-att-9306"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9306" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/40089bd8a3615c0db500adc387c0794a_XL.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="40089bd8a3615c0db500adc387c0794a_XL" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Inside Out is at its most magical during Act II. The conflict of the film and its resolution are never really in doubt as you watch the movie. The gift of Inside Out is not it&#8217;s story, but its storytelling. Act II uses the canvas established in Act I and animates a world so intimate and connected to our personhood that it seems like the metaphors are being stretched too thin. In truth, the metaphors of Inside Out are so magnificently constructed that they bend but do not break. I am reluctant to spoil anything for readers who want to see Inside Out without more direct clues and references, so I am warning you now. Extremely minor spoilers ahead. Choose wisely. If you are leaving now, go watch the movie, come back to this page, and continue reading from here.</p>
<p>If the the story of Riley&#8217;s feelings is the canvas, what exactly is the painting? In essence, the premise of Inside Out is that every memory we collect in our life is assigned an emotion. In the movie, these memories are colored crystal spheres. The spheres are filed in various places in Riley&#8217;s brain the way we would imagine our memories being collated. Some are discarded, others sent to Riley&#8217;s Long Term Memory, others remain local, and the most important memories are called Core Memories. These Core Memories build the thematic islands in Riley&#8217;s memory. There is an island for family, and friends, and goofiness, and hockey, among others. Throughout her day, Riley&#8217;s brain shifts between recalling old memories from relevant islands and adding new memories to those islands. Each crystal sphere is defined by a feeling and when it is added to the inventory or remembered, the memory retains its feelings. An angry family memory will be colored red, it will be added to the inventory, and it will help power the family island. That&#8217;s how it all works.</p>
<p>Of course, there is so much room for humor and hijinks when dealing with memories. I won&#8217;t spoil those, but the group of mostly adult theater goers were laughing hysterically when they weren&#8217;t collapsing from the emotional drain of the sentimental moments.</p>
<p>Without spoiling the plot, Act II is all about the crystal spheres and the islands. The story is nice, but as I said in my Interstellar review, the greatness of this film is not its story, it is the magic of its storytelling device. Pixar does not waste its opportunity. Inside Out is a battering ram of important lessons, ideas, and issues. Which leads me to a some final points.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that one reason I related to strongly to Inside Out is because I am the father of a son who recently turned 12 years old. Inside Out was basically about him. He knew it. We knew it. And it was quite powerful to experience this movie with him. Pixar is not just entertaining us with its movies. Pixar is moving the cultural dial. There is stuff in the movie that we have been working on as a family and as individuals. Character stuff. Growing up stuff. In fact, the comparison I keep hearing in my head is to A Separate Peace: a coming of age story that encapsulates the social struggles of the high school teen, and by proxy, adults as well. Inside Out is a coming of age story that encapsulates the emotional struggles of the preteen, and by proxy, teens and adults as well.</p>
<p>But above all, I heard so many themes, lessons, and metaphors in the film that sounded more than just familiar to me, they sounded <em>like me. </em>I have been using a version of the crystal sphere memories metaphor for years. I&#8217;ve applied it to religion &#8211; that is the essence of this essay: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/">Cultivating Positive Jewish Experiences</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/11/rising-from-the-ashes-of-bad-orthodox-jewish-experiences/">Rising From the Ashes of Bad Orthodox Jewish Experiences</a> , I&#8217;ve also applied it to relationships in my pastoral work, and I&#8217;ve applied it to life in general. Seeing an idea I&#8217;ve worked through over the course of many years in my own life and in conversations with others come to life on the big screen was a powerful experience for me on a personal level. Inside Out is saying something that I have been trying to say for a little while now. That was pretty special for me.</p>
<p>One last thing. On a societal level, I am proud to be part of a global community that values the fundamental moral of the Inside Out story as I see it. We all want happiness and joy and we can sometimes think that we will feel happiness and joy if we don&#8217;t feel all the other feelings. But one thing our society understands is that happiness and joy can only be real when they are part of a collective of feelings. Inside Out teaches this lesson superbly, and that makes me proud.</p>
<p>Adults, teens, and children 10 and older should definitely see Inside Out. Younger children might not appreciate its finer themes, but there is nothing objectionable for the under 10 crowd. Families should capitalize on this film to engage in frank conversations about feelings and emotions. Use Inside Out to inspire and ignite you to make yourself a better person, friend, spouse, parent, and child.</p>
<p><em>I intend to write a follow up essay that actually discusses some of my favorite lessons and most poignant moments from the film. I also want to demonstrate how I think this all connects to religion and Judaism. But it wouldn&#8217;t make sense without seeing Inside Out. So get on that, and hopefully soon I can write a more spoiler-y analysis of Inside Out&#8217;s brilliance. Meanwhile, if you want to buy me a gift (my birthday is one month), get me some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;bbn=11634679011&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;pf_rd_i=inside%20out%20plush&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=2106847982&amp;pf_rd_r=1W4VT5FWSJRXZYGYA616&amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-auto-sparkle&amp;pf_rd_t=301&amp;qid=1434536448&amp;ref=spkl_4_2_2106847982&amp;rh=i%3Atoys-and-games%2Cn%3A165793011%2Cn%3A!2334111011%2Cn%3A!2334173011%2Cn%3A11634679011%2Cn%3A166461011%2Cp_6%3AATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;rw_html_to_wsrp=1&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=HNT6VS3S53HBFD3L" target="_blank">Inside Out plush from Amazon</a>!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/disneyland-address.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3677" title="disneyland-address" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/disneyland-address.jpg?resize=300%2C230" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I confess.</p>
<p>I love Disneyland. I love going for myself and I love going to experience all the fun with my family. My older son loves the &#8220;scary rides&#8221; and I cherish our moments together as we free fall through the park. My younger son loves Mickey and Minnie, Goofy and Donald, Winnie the Pooh and Tigger and seeing his face light up when he gets to meet them, give them a hug and take a picture is precious.</p>
<p>Disneyland claims that they are the happiest place on earth.</p>
<p>This is an easily falsifiable claim that many angry parents and misbehaving children can easily contest. But for me and my family, Disneyland is a very happy place to be. I won&#8217;t go so far as to say &#8220;the happiest place on earth&#8221;. We try to make that our home. But we will let Disneyland get away with a little hyperbole.<span id="more-3676"></span></p>
<p>Even if Disneyland is on the actual factual happiest place on earth they do have a great lesson in happiness to share. One of the more popular rides at Disneyland and Walt Disney World in Florida is Splash Mountain. The ride tells the story of Br&#8217;er Fox and Br&#8217;er Bear who try to capture a certain Br&#8217;er Rabbit. Your ride takes you on a log through their chase and the rabbit&#8217;s escape ending with a 52 foot drop where you are likely to get wet. Last week it was 80 degrees in Disneyland. So getting wet was a welcome development for my son and I as we screamed our way down the 52 feet (twice).</p>
<p>While you are waiting on line for the time of your life (FYI: always FastPass Splash Mountain), there are some signs along the route that help pass the time. This is my favorite:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0182.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3678" title="IMG_0182" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0182.jpg?resize=614%2C458" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">For the blurrycam reading impaired: &#8220;</span><em>Everyone&#8217;s got a laughin&#8217; place &#8211; trouble is most folks won&#8217;t take the time to go look for it. And where it is for one, mightn&#8217;t be for another.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the truth. We can all find happiness somewhere, in something. But most of us are too busy to find it. It&#8217;s so much easier to complain about our unhappiness than to actually do the work to find what does make us happy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And when we do find it, we think it should be the same place for everybody else&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Take Disney&#8217;s advice. After all they are the experts on happiness&#8230; Find your laughin&#8217; place. Enjoy life. Help others enjoy life. And stop complaining about not being happy. It&#8217;s up to you to find your own happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh and for the record, Space Mountain is the best ride in Disneyland.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/03/11/does-jeff-mcgregor-learn-messilas-yesharim/" target="_blank">A few months back I hinted at a future post</a> about athletes and their role in our society as role models.</p>
<p>This past weekend I was reminded about my feelings on the subject. What I feel is what I believe to be the Torah approach but is of consequence and significance to anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>Over the weekend the NBA Conference Finals were settled. Something that happened after one team was eliminated has caused a media frenzy.<span id="more-735"></span></p>
<p>First, the Los Angeles Lakers advanced to the NBA finals for the 30th time in 61 years. (yay!) That is serious excellence right there. For the non-fans this means that during the games you will be able to drive the speed limit on the 405 because everyone else will be inside watching the game.</p>
<p>Then on Saturday night the impossible happened. LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers were eliminated by the Orlando Magic. Why is this the impossible? LeBron is a &#8220;godlike&#8221; figure and was expected to &#8220;redeem&#8221; his team and city by bringing them to the &#8220;promised land&#8221;. I am not kidding. Sportscenter on ESPN had a segment where a Minister from Cleveland said that Clevelanders were beginning to worship &#8220;The King&#8221;. LeBron is the most celebrated human being on the planet and is idolized around the world.</p>
<p>Anyway, the poor guy loses in 6 games to the Magic.</p>
<p>Ironically, this gives ABC Broadcasting which is owned by Disney a Walt Disney World (Orlando) vs. Disneyland (LA) Championship. Talk about jackpot!</p>
<p>The custom in all sports is for the losing team to shake the hands of the winning team and congratulate them upon winning. In fact according to Websters, this is the very definition of &#8220;Sportsmanship&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span>conduct (as fairness, respect for one&#8217;s opponent, and graciousness in winning or losing) becoming to one participating in a sport.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The word has been around since <em>1745</em> and is preached universally to all athletes and competitors.</p>
<p>LeBron was so upset about losing to the Magic that <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/news/story?id=4218722" target="_blank">he left the court in a hurry</a> and did not congratulate the winning team. This is a big no-no.</p>
<p>In fact, he was so upset<em> </em>by the loss he also skipped out on the mandatory press conference.</p>
<p>That is bad sportsmanship. No question about it.</p>
<p>Do I care?</p>
<p><em>Absolutely not.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect better from an athlete. His excellence in Basketball has no bearing on his excellence in social skills, personal growth, intelligence, happiness or even sportsmanship. The only thing that he does that commands respect is his ball playing prowess. That is the only thing I look up to in this person.</p>
<p>Is he sending a bad message?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t turn to LeBron for messages on Sportsmanship. Nor do I turn to any athlete or celebrity for anything other than waht makes them unique or special.</p>
<p>As a parent it is my job to provide good role models for my children. I may need to be that role model at times. At other times it will teachers, Rabbis, family members or other people who command respect for their area of specialty. Athletes are not role models. Allowing an athlete to be the role model for your child is a failure in  your parenting.</p>
<p>Athletes may by chance turn out to be wonderful people whom we may respect for their abilities beyond sports, and that is great but it is not the norm. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/01/kobe-and-zehirus/" target="_blank">I myself have commented</a> on some athletes ability to prepare for their games and we can learn about preparation from them. However, expecting athletes to be role models is a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I think parents get lazy and expect their children to learn good values without taking the time or effort to teach those values. When the child gets nothing from his parents, athletes may fill that void. Ultimately they will all disappoint us.</p>
<p>Be a role model and don&#8217;t rely on superhuman athletes to do it for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NY Times has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/14/arts/television/14boys.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes" target="_blank">very interesting article</a> chronicling the research that Disney has been conducting to figure out what boys want.</p>
<p>Disney has had unprecedented success marketing to young teenage girls. With TV shows about pop-stars and princess and fairy lands, young teenage girls flock to Disney. But what about the boys?<span id="more-458"></span></p>
<p>Disney has been doing their homework. Apparently, boys are sick of pure violence in their shows. Boys don&#8217;t want more pointless TV. Boys want meaning.</p>
<p>Who knew?</p>
<p>For years marketing execs and TV stations have assumed that boys want reckless abandon and wild play. Disney has discovered that stuff has its place but, it all must fall within a framework of meaning.</p>
<p>Boys want to empathize with the boy who is a mediocre basketball player. Boys want to witness his struggle and feel his pain.</p>
<p>The new Disney channel and website geared towards boys will hit these points. Boys will get their version of Disney called <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneyxd/" target="_blank">Disney XD</a> which hones in on these aspects of boys needs.</p>
<p>Boys want a struggle while girls want pop-stars. Who knew? Disney knew.</p>
<p>In truth we all covet meaning in our lives. Disney will be offering programming that adresses this meaning. But what about us? We need meaning as well. Where do we find meaning?</p>
<p>Torah provides meaning and purpose. If you are looking for something to provide meaning to your life try some Torah. We provide Torah at the <a href="http://www.pjcenter.org" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a>. There is Torah all over this blog. Just click the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/podcasts" target="_blank">podcasts</a> on the top of this page. You&#8217;ll find classes on all types of life topics and ideas. Disney knows we need meaning&#8230; and it is all right here.</p>
