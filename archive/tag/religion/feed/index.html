				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pew Research Center released their recent study, and the results paint a bleak picture of our religious future in America. It is clear: God’s poll numbers are down across the board, and especially among Millennials. Immediately, frantic media headlines prophesied the end of religion as we know it.</p>
<p>Is this fate? Are we destined to live in a non-religious world? I don’t think we are doomed, unless we keep doing the same things we are doing now. If we want to reverse the trend, we need to reverse course. Suggesting change in religious circles is often taboo. It reminds me of one of my father’s oft repeated (aren’t they all?) jokes. <em>How many Ultra-Orthodox rabbis does it take to change a lightbulb?</em> [beat] <em>Change?!</em><br />
<span id="more-9356"></span></p>
<p>We believers think God gave us our religions. They are not ours to be tinkered and toyed with on a whim.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/07/13/religion-is-dead-long-live-religion/sf/" rel="attachment wp-att-9357"><img class="alignright wp-image-9357 size-thumbnail" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sf.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="sf" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Thus, many believers exclaim that people are abandoning religion because we have become too flexible, too apologetic, too concerned with popular opinion and trends. Their solution is fundamentalism, as it was for the Puritans after the Renaissance, premillennial dispensationalists after Darwin, and Evangelicals in the 80’s after the sexual revolution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, post-modern fundamentalists are making a fundamental mistake. Most Millennials will never be fundamentalists. Above all, they reject the idea that there is only one universal truth. Where hippies rejected authority on principle, Millennials reject appeals to authority because there is no such thing as an authority of ideas. For my entire lifetime of active learning, I’ve been able to fact check anything asserted by an authority as fact. I have never needed to trust authority or rely on the opinions of one person. Self-guided research, diversity, and subjectivity are native to the Millennial generation.</p>
<p>When presented with fundamentalist ideas, we don’t find the “all or nothing” packages attractive. Some of the ideas that are preached by fundamentalists have merit, but that does not translate into adopting fundamentalism. It did in the 80’s. Evangelical Christianity and the Jewish “returnee” movement were massive movements that took hold in the 80’s, and both remain in their own shadows from that time. More fundamentalism is not the answer. In fact, it&#8217;s part of the problem.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the non-fundamentalist option has been to change. When the rules get tough, change the rules. If some of the theology is at odds with modern ideals, just rewrite it. By drawing a target around the arrow after it is lodged in the tree, liberal religious groups can make participation effortless and guiltless. The appeal of change is that is promises everything, but the reality is that this sort of change completely undermines religion.</p>
<p>Millennials flock to authentic experiences. Burning Man is a perfect example of this.  A Burning Man experience is powerful, unique, and above all, authentic.  Similarly, artisanal foods are quintessentially Millennial. No Millennial is trading fine French cuisine for a Big Mac. We want the real thing. We want meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>A counterfeit religious experience is no religious experience at all. It might keep families together at church and synagogue for a few more years, but without authenticity and engagement, nothing will connect Millennials to the experience. It’s hollow. When the structural shell is removed, nothing remains.</p>
<p>But all is not lost. I think there is an alternative approach that respects tradition, does not compromise authenticity, and works for Millennials. The first part of my proposal is that religion is actually a collection of beliefs and practices which ask us to struggle in the tension they create. There is beauty in tension. Ambiguity and doubt are key ingredients to great art. Poetry, music, theater, visual arts, culinary arts, love, and beauty are all ambiguous. They are all open to interpretation, and they all ask us to insert our struggles into the space they create for creative understanding.</p>
<p>We must stop preaching certainty and begin preaching doubt and struggle. Find beauty in the tension, instead of satisfaction in certainty. Religious leaders must be honest, and publicly acknowledge their own struggles and doubts. Instead of occupying the space of certainty that is anathema to Millennials, religion must occupy the space of subjectivity, ambiguity, and struggle. Religion is not the answer to life’s questions. Religion is the tool for exploring the big questions.</p>
<p>We can tolerate mistakes, difficult challenges, unanswered questions, and tension between tradition and modernity. We will not tolerate platitudes, over-confidence, false bravado, and apologetics. Be honest. Acknowledge the problems. Admit your own struggles. Then, invite the Millennials in your life to join you for an authentic experience of engaging with life’s struggles through the lens of religion. The Biblical heroes were flawed and they struggled. Let’s emphasize those stories and animate those Bible passages in our teachings.</p>
<p>The second part of my proposal is found in the tension between nostalgia and relevance. So much of our religious instruction and experience is nostalgic. We try to recapture something magical from our childhood, or a latent memory from a place and time that tugs at us. Millennials love nostalgia, and it’s a valuable tool when, but religion cannot subsist on nostalgia alone.</p>
<p>Our world is so different from the world of our Biblical heroes. Our lives are virtually nothing like the lives of the centuries of interpreters and teachers of religion. We must continue to lean on the eternal teaching they have bequeathed to us, but their teachings felt contemporary to their direct audiences. When we retell their teachings, they may feel nostalgic at best and irrelevant at worst. We must continue to write and create teachings that resonate with us and tell our story.</p>
<p>The Bible is an incredible canvas. Religious texts offer innumerable opportunities for modern interpretation. Not the kind that strips religion of its precepts, rather, the sort of modern interpretations that bring ancient teachings to life. When we explain our rituals, we must choose explanations that add meaning to our lives today. Take ownership of our religions. We can&#8217;t expect Millennials to be spectators of their religion. Millennials want to participate with mind, spirit, soul, and body. Relevance is key to hooking religion to our lives, and not merely relegating our traditions to museums and mausoleums.</p>
<p>I believe in God. I believe in religion. I believe in Millennials. This is fixable problem. Let’s fix it. Acknowledge our struggles. Live in the tension. Make religion relevant with new and modern interpretation. Live a life infused with religious meaning. When the results of the next Pew report on religion in America are released, we can shock the world.</p>

We talked a bit about what this means and why it&#8217;s necessary. Then we were joined by my superstar guest, Rabbi Doniel Katz.</p>
<p>In my view, Rabbi Katz is leading the charge in addressing these issues. We come from very different perspectives but our ideas overlap significantly. It was a great discussion and we could have done another 8 hours, at least.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s talk about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/17/inside-out-movie-review-and-analysis/">Inside Out</a> again. But this time we are not just going to talk in the superficial, “go see it” kind of way we did last time. Now it’s time for real talk.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Storytelling and Canvas Building</strong></span><br />
Movies can be diversions or just pure entertainment, but sometimes movies can be so much more. There are movies that illustrate grand important ideas in a new way that pushes culture and society forward. To me, this is the peak of storytelling. When the story itself is not really the thing the story is saying, because the thing the story is saying is so much bigger than the story, we experience a sort of storytelling magic.</p>
<p>Too often, fiction undermines reality. I’ll never forget this quip from Rabbi Tendler during a private study session. <em>“If you expect marriage to be the way marriage is portrayed in novels and films, you’re going to be waiting a long time for the violins.”</em> In context, he was teaching me that relationships take work and popular culture is not very good at real relationships. Generally, we watch saccharine caricatures of real life with simple resolutions, over-emphasis on raw feelings, and of course, violins.</p>
<p>I love when fiction does not try to rewrite reality. I love when fiction tells us something about reality. Done right, a movie can be a powerful storytelling device that helps us to understand and deal with reality. Fiction can be real.<span id="more-9321"></span></p>
<p><strong><u>A Movie of Biblical Proportions</u></strong><br />
Inside Out is not a very interesting story. There’s no villain, except maybe “the passing of time” and most of the story happens inside the head of an 11 year old girl named Riley. A lot of people seem to think that the movie is about the voices inside Riley. But the movie is not about the voices inside Riley’s head at all. They are just part of the canvas the real story of Inside Out is painting.</p>
<p>The brilliance of Inside Out is its lesson. Its mini lessons along the way are amazing. The way it teaches its lessons, using its internal metaphors and symbolism, is much more than brilliance, it is almost Biblical.</p>
<p>I think the primary lesson of Inside Out is profoundly simple. We have all been misled to believe that happiness is the cumulative feeling of avoiding pain, sadness, misery, and doubt. That is a lie. Happiness and joy are not the absence of bad experiences at all. In fact, without negative experiences, there is no joy. Children are not mature enough to understand this sophisticated point even if it is taught directly. Children deal with emotions and feelings in a very binary way. Things are either good or bad.</p>
<p>The real world is not like this at all.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/24/growing-up-what-religion-can-learn-from-the-magic-of-inside-out/insideout-640/" rel="attachment wp-att-9325"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9325" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/insideout-640.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="insideout-640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Everything in our lives is a complex cocktail of contributory emotions. A little bit happy, a little bit sad, a little bit angry, a little bit worried, a little bit thrilled, and all at different levels. The first time we feel these complexities, it can be disconcerting. Adolescents are often brooding, moody, unpredictable, and sometimes their personalities are very different than they were as children. Part of that is the discomfort with encountering reality and perhaps even the real self. Inside Out is a parable that helps us understand the challenge of growing up from a child to an adult.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The New &#8216;A Separate Peace&#8217;</strong></span><br />
The fear and loathing of meeting one’s real self is the theme of one of my favorite books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743253973/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0743253973&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=ZWOK3ZIBBJ3RR5JF">A Separate Peace</a>. It’s a mediocre story, but the story is not really the thing the story is saying. A Separate Peace is about adolescence, and facing one’s true self. That’s what it’s really about.</p>
<p>Inside Out is working on a different angle. The movie is helping us be honest with ourselves about what really makes us happy. Inside Out shows us that the best feelings and best emotions are a mixture of joy, anger, disgust, fear, and even sadness. In fact, Joy was only able to return to Riley because of Sadness. Acknowledging our sadness gives us the opportunity for happiness, not avoiding sadness. It wasn’t only Sadness, it was also letting go of childhood by saying goodbye to her imaginary childhood friend, Bing Bong. It’s counterintuitive at first, but just past the initial superficial level, lies this obvious truth. There is no happiness without sadness and there is no growing up without letting go of childhood.</p>
<p>These ideas are almost glibly demonstrated during Inside Out. But don’t let the simplicity of the way Inside Out teaches its lessons fool you into thinking these are not sophisticated and meaningful teachings.</p>
<p>Once Riley’s feelings are able to work together to craft more meaningful memories, their control panel console grows. Children only experience one feeling at a time and only one feeling can be in charge at any given moment. When we grow up, each feeling has a seat at the table and they all work together instead of jockeying for control. This is the primary lesson of Inside Out.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some Bonus Lessons</span></strong><br />
Along the way, Inside Out creates a magnificent storytelling device that gives the writers opportunities to teach so many more lessons that are tangential to the story. Inside Out sees our memories as sources of power for several islands in Riley’s brain. Each island represents a fundamental group of memories and experiences that Riley “visits” during nostalgic moments. The internal logic of the movie kicks Joy and Sadness out of Riley consciousness following a traumatic experience. Joy and Sadness find themselves marooned far away from headquarters. Their path back to headquarters is along the connection between headquarters and the islands. As Riley destroys her islands by poisoning her memories with rebellion, the path through Family Island remains Joy’s last hope. But when Riley kills Honesty Island, the paths to headquarters are all gone. I thought this was an incredible, subtle message about the importance of honesty. As long we are honest with others and ourself there is a path back.</p>
<p>Another amazing lesson was perhaps the most explicit moral of all. Bing Bong is feeling very sad and Joy tries every trick in the book to cheer him up. She is doing everything she can do to overpower Bing Bong’s sad feelings with her intense joy. It does not work. Sadness sits down next to Bing Bong and just listens to him tell her how he feels. Sadness tells him that she totally understands why he is sad and offers a hug and shoulder to cry on. That works. Joy is flabbergasted. Sadness explains that she saw he was sad so she just wanted him to know that she understands.</p>
<p>Later in the movie, Riley and her parents share a tender moment when they are honest with each other about how they feel. No one tries to fix their sadness or anxiety. They simply hear each other and enjoy a loving family hug.</p>
<p>Too often, we think the way to help a sad friend is to cheer them up. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/05/fixing-shiva/" target="_blank">But I think it’s always more helpful to just listen, understand, and offer a warm hug and shoulder to cry on</a>.</p>
<p>There are many additional teachings sprinkled though Inside Out. A few memorable moments stand out. My favorite might be when a box labeled “Opinions” and box labeled “Facts” spill over and the contents get mixed up. &#8220;Oh no!&#8221; exclaims Joy, &#8220;these facts and opinions look so similar!&#8221; &#8220;People are always getting these mixed up,&#8221; says Bing Bong. Indeed, they do.</p>
<p><strong><u>Who Cares?!</u></strong><br />
Why am I talking about Inside Out? Is there a point to all this?</p>
<p>Good question. Yes, there is a point to all this Inside Out talk. Two major points, in fact. One from the negative perspective and one from a positive perspective.</p>
<p>We are all Riley. Those of us are religious Rileys have an additional island of memories in our brain. Religious Riley has Religion Island. That’s where all our religious memories live. For most children, Religion Island should be pretty sweet. Kids love religion. It’s fun. The stories are interesting. The food is familiar. You spend more time with parents and family. Religion Island is awesome when you’re a kid. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">I think it&#8217;s important to actively create this sweetness for our families and communities</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Religious Trauma</span></strong><br />
Inside Out showed us how trauma shatters our childhood islands. When pain and sadness infect our religious nostalgia, we are destroying Religious Island. Some trauma is a direct result of religious experience and other trauma is unrelated to the religious experience. Any trauma can wreck Religion Island. This can happen even against our own wishes.</p>
<p>Religious leaders who seek to hide or inhibit public conversation about religious leaders who stumble or other flaws in their community, for fear of encouraging religious reprisal., or worse, are missing the point. It’s not the knowledge of bad behavior that harms people, it’s the trauma itself. Trauma severs the relationship between the person and the positive memories. Hearing about it does not do that at all. I think the Religious Island Destroyed by Trauma metaphor severely undermines the strategy of silencing criticism or victims of abuse.</p>
<p>More importantly, it explains why most of the people who leave their religious communities, don&#8217;t find comfort in a less strict religious community. Their religious island is gone. This new place is not the old place. The new place feels fraudulent and fake. <a href="http://zeek.forward.com/articles/117822/" target="_blank">The trust is gone</a>. But that does not mean it&#8217;s the end of the story.</p>
<p>There is also something incredible hopeful about the way Inside Out portrayed how Riley <em>rebuilt</em> her islands. True, the islands were completely useless following the trauma Riley experienced. But the movie shows us those islands restored and thriving even more than they were before they were broken. We also see added complexity to Riley’s islands and they are being powered by the new core memory cocktails of mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Often enough, people want to rebuild their dilapidated or broken religious islands. Somehow, Religion Island was destroyed for them at some point.  Eventually, they might want to reassemble their religious islands. But reconstruction is not possible using those old simple memories that are generally good. The cotton candy version of religion is gone for these people, but <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/11/rising-from-the-ashes-of-bad-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">building something new, with complexity, embracing ambiguity, and engaging in their struggles, is absolutely available</a>. It takes work, but it might be worth the effort.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consciousness and Construction</span></strong><br />
I think most conscious people have had their dreamlike childhood memories smashed. They might have felt real in the moment, but they are not reality. The real world is complex and confusing and contradictory. Real lasting relationships are built out of mixed core memory cocktails. Relationships between us and our spirituality, between us and our religion, between us and our community, our family, our spouse, our parents, our children, and ourselves, all can function, blissfully unaware, in rainbow, lollipop, and unicorn mode. In that mode, they are super fragile and they might collapse in a quick heap. But all our relationships function on a much higher level if we are conscious of the relationship and its complexity. They improve, when the parties to a relationship make the effort to build after something has been broken.</p>
<p>This secret to living is the soul of one important message in Inside Out. It&#8217;s applicable to religion, but it&#8217;s just as applicable to friendship, courtship, marriage, self awareness, and any other relationship. We start with only childish nostalgia. It might break one day and that will hurt, a lot. But moving past our childish nostalgia is not bad or evil, it&#8217;s just growing up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about time too. After all those years of hinting to us that we should try to just be a kid and stay young forever, Disney Pixar is telling us that it&#8217;s also time to grow up &#8211; from the inside, out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kosher Switch has been in development for several years. According to the inventor, the device replaces the standard light switch and through the magic of technology and Jewish law allows Shabbat observant Jews to switch their lights on and off. Last week, the company launched a campaign on Indiegogo to raise funds to satisfy minimum manufacturer requirements and begin production. The promotional video claims that leading rabbinic authorities approve the device for Shabbat use. In response, a proclamation signed by prominent American rabbinic authorities warned residents of Flatbush that the device was not kosher for Shabbat use and it should not be brought into one&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>A lot of the subsequent discussion has been somewhat juvenile. Questions about motive, credibility, and consistency have been raised in all directions and accusations of impropriety have been levied as well. To me, this is all just a distraction from the real issue here: <strong>Is the Kosher Switch Kosher? [Please show your work]</strong></p>
<p>Instead of delving into the religio-legal issues raised by the Kosher Switch, I find far too much of the discourse to be declarative and even in the rare case that arguments are made in favor or against the device, the articles read like persuasive briefs instead of dispassionate legal jurisprudence. I have read everything I could find and would like to present both sides of the issue as I see it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Needless to say, this discussion is for educational purposes only. If you are looking for a psak, ask a posek.</strong></em><span id="more-9185"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Prohibition</strong></p>
<p>I. Flipping a light switch on Shabbat might be a Biblical prohibition, but according to many opinions it might be a rabbinic prohibition.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9190" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/electricity-05.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="electricity-05" data-recalc-dims="1" /> If it is Biblical, one set of principles applies, and if it is rabbinic, another package of principles apply. Activating a circuit is presumed to be prohibited, but as has been noted, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to identify the actual prohibition. Lighting an incandescent bulb is the most likely candidate for Biblical prohibition due to the heating of the coils and the heat that it emits. But we live in a fluorescent world, and I think we can assume that the Kosher Switch is trying to solve a rabbinic problem as opposed to a Biblical problem.</p>
<p>II. The Torah forbids mindful acts of Shabbat desecration. Thus, there are several leniencies that can theoretically mitigate Biblical prohibition. When one performs an action that unwittingly causes a prohibited result it is permissible. This is called davar sh&#8217;eino mitkaven. But the leniency only applies as long as the unintended result was not inevitable, otherwise it is prohibited. This principle is called psik reisha, and the action is Biblically prohibited. However, if the unintended result of the action is undesirable it is called a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei and it is not Biblically prohibited. There is a dispute among the Medieval commentators whether a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei is still rabbinically prohibited or if it is permissible.</p>
<p>III. There is a secondary dispute among the late Medieval and Renaissance commentators when a psik reisha only produces a rabbinically prohibited result. Some say it is still prohibited rabbinically, and others say it is completely permissible. Even those who prohibit in these cases may allow psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei. Some prohibit even in such cases, and others only allow under certain conditions.</p>
<p>IV. When it&#8217;s unknown if the psik reisha resulted in a prohibition it is called a safeik psik reisha. One late Renaissance opinion holds this would not even be considered a psik reisha, and is not prohibited at all. One Contemporary authority rules that safeik psik reisha is permissible when the result is rabbinically prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Proximate Cause</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Indirectly causing a prohibited result is called grama. The Talmud offers two seemingly contradictory positions on grama. One is permitted to place vessels filled with water in the path of a fire. The fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels, and extinguishing fire is normally prohibited. The Talmud explains that this is a permissible case of grama. However, the Talmud also prohibits tossing wheat with its chaff into the wind to separate the kernel from the chaff, even though that appears to be a grama as well. Several narrowing definitions of grama have been proposed to reconcile this issue.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>When there is a time lapse between the action and the result it is considered a grama. It will take some time for the water to be released from the vessels but the chaff will be removed from the wheat almost immediately.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the indirect cause is the normal manner in which the result is achieved. Normally, one would not extinguish a fire by placing vessels of water in its path, but one <em>would</em> toss wheat in the air to winnow.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the person completes the indirect act, and an intervening act is still needed to cause the prohibited result. The water is trapped in vessels that are a distance away from the fire, so the fire must travel and burst the vessels.  In the case of the wheat, the wind is <em>already</em> blowing when one throws the wheat in the air.</li>
<li>Or perhaps grama is only when the prohibited result is not inevitable. There is no guarantee that the fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels but it&#8217;s certain that the wind will remove some chaff from the wheat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Grama is not a blanket permission. The general consensus is that grama is only allowed in cases of great need. Some Modern and Contemporary authorities hold that grama would also be permissible when the result is not desired.</li>
<li>One Contemporary rabbinic authority holds that oneg Shabbat (pleasure of Shabbat) is considered a great need.   <strong><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Not Even a Grama</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>The foremost Renaissance halachic authority for Ashkenazi Jewry says one can leave a candle near a door if the wind is not blowing, even if the wind will eventually blow. He also holds that grama is only permissible in cases of financial loss, and since here he makes no such stipulation, it can be assumed that he holds this is not even a case of grama.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the other contributing factor causing the prohibition exists. But where the wind is not blowing, the thing that is needed to complete the act does not even exist at the time of human act.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the human act is <em>connected</em> to the thing that will complete the prohibited act. The human is only opening a door to let the wind blow. The wind is the thing doing the extinguishing and the act is not connected to the wind.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Kosher Switch</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Basically, two things are happening inside the Kosher Switch. First, there is an emitter and a receiver that complete a circuit. When the emitter and receiver are active, the circuit is complete and the light is on. The second component is a barrier that creates a blockage between emitter and receiver when the switch is flipped.</li>
<li>When the light is on, the emitter and receiver cycle through sleep and active periods and an indicator will tell the user when they are asleep. The user will move the barrier by flipping the switch, and at a random time, the emitter will try to connect to the receiver. If it cannot connect, the circuit will be disrupted and the light will turn off. When the emitter and receiver are sleeping, an indicator tells the user it&#8217;s safe to move the switch. If the barrier is moved, the emitter and receiver will communicate at a random time and will attempt to complete the circuit. Even when the barrier is removed, the emitter and receiver do not automatically connect. They both randomly generate codes that must &#8220;match&#8221; in order to complete the circuit. After each failed attempt, the emitter will try connected again at a random time. If the barrier has not been moved, the emitter will not see the receiver and the light will remain off.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Show Your Work</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Flipping the Kosher Switch does not directly turn the lights on or off.<img class="alignright wp-image-9188 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/KosherSwitch1.jpg?resize=449%2C600" alt="KosherSwitch1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></li>
<li>Assuming it is considered a psik reisha, the result is a rabbinically prohibited act. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>Assuming a psik reisha that produces a rabinically prohibited act is still prohibited, the act of flipping the switch might be a safeik psik reisha. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because there is a time lapse between the switch flip and the circuit completing.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because an intervening act, by the emitter and receiver, is needed to complete the circuit.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s possible that it could be a grama because the Kosher Switch is not the normal manner one turns on a light. Maybe.</li>
<li>If the light is considered oneg Shabbat, grama plus a &#8220;great need&#8221; would render the switch permissible according to some.</li>
<li>It might not be a grama at all, because the current is totally dead at the time of the act. Non-grama is certainly permissible.</li>
<li>Or it might not be grama at all because the human act is not connected to the emitter and receiver. The human act only connects to the switch and barrier.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Objections</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if they added to the ‘Grama’ additional apparatuses, and even if there is a one in a thousand chance that the action will not occur, I have received from my rabbis (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R. Shaul Yisraeli) that this does not change in any way the halakhic status of regular ‘grama’ (just like grama D’grama and other artificial arrangements).&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if the method of operation is non-active from the point of view of the agent, i.e. because he merely removes the “preventing element,” Rabbi S. Z. Auerbach and others wrote that this remains forbidden and is treated like it was done directly by the person, since the action occurs immediately after the human intervention/action. Even if the result comes only after a delay caused by an additional factor, this is plain grama, which is still not permitted L’chatchila.&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Student argues that the Kosher Switch is only a grama according to some opinions and even a grama is not permissible ab initio.</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;We must question whether a case can be built for permissibility based on what the Gemara does not say. That is, the fact that the Gemara does not speak of the halacha of something that has not entered the world does not prove that this case is less than a grama. Perhaps this case is deemed a grama too!&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;Even should this logic be sound, one can hardly call the pulses “not in this world,” since the switch is designed for the function to turn on intermittently. It is an absolute certainty that the force will come back into existence, and this is by design. Even if we could find a case of wind that is not “in this world” that is permissible, this is only because the effect is not under man’s control, which thus “distances” his action from the eventual force (see Magen Avraham 328:53). However, the pulses in the Kosher Switch are designed and controlled by man to arrive with continuity, and thus bear no comparison to the case of the wind, which is beyond his control.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Possible Responses</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Okay, but there is precedent for &#8220;not even grama&#8221; under similar circumstances. Not everyone has to agree with what you received from your rabbis.</li>
<li>Right, but this is a switch that is delayed and also dependent on random emitter and receiver contact which could have legal implications according to some precedents. Further, even if it is a grama, it could be combined with oneg Shabbat to establish a &#8220;great need.&#8221;</li>
<li>There is a solid argument, with precedent, to say that it is not even grama. And again, even if it is grama it might be okay.</li>
<li>The Talmud doesn&#8217;t say it, but the foremost Renaissance rabbinic authority seems to hold this way.</li>
<li>Sure, this is possible. But so is the alternative proposed by Kosher Switch proponents. It might be different than the wind, but it might be similar as well.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So there you have it. A legitimate discussion about Kosher Switch from a religio-legal perspective.</p>
<p>It seems like two things might be happening here. It&#8217;s possible that the opponents of the Kosher Switch did not read through the responsa on the Kosher Switch website. All their questions are covered in their materials. But I think there is something deeper happening here as well. I have a feeling that the Kosher Switch proponents are using a different paradigm than the opponents.</p>
<p>The opponents seem to hold that in order for something to be permissible it needs to work according to all established rabbinic authorities. The Kosher Switch certainly does not meet that bar. Kosher Switch proponents hold that in order for something to be prohibited it needs to not work according to all established rabbinic authorities. Unfortunately, both sides seem to believe that their approach is the only correct approach so they do not acknowledge the validity of their opponents.</p>
<p>This represents a huge gap between two acceptable ways to look at halacha. I do think that the idea that we should try to satisfy all halachic precedent has some roots in the Talmud. But the importance and universal emphasis we give to this idea is somewhat a new innovation. It&#8217;s prominent in the Mishna Berura, a 20th century compilation and commentary on one section of the Code of Jewish Law. The Chofetz Chaim seems to have attempted to select and codify the halachic opinions that were most universally held. Today, the idea is very prominent in Brisk and its progeny. The hallmark of this approach is its lack of self confidence and self reliance. We are nervous that we are not doing it right so we try to fulfill as many positions as possible because one of them has got to be right.</p>
<p>We also have a tradition of &#8220;koach d&#8217;hetera adif&#8221; &#8211; the power to permit is great, and the concept of &#8220;limud zechus&#8221; &#8211; trying to find any halachic path to justify questionable behavior. The Aruch HaShulchan, by Rav Yechiel Michel Epstein, an exhaustive restatement of Jewish law written in the late 19th century, is known for its efforts on this side of the halachic coin. Rabbi Epstein tried to be machria and choose a path but he presented a potpourri of acceptable opinions in every section. It seems that this tradition is less prominent in our society. The hallmark of this approach is autonomy and courage. We try to research a topic as best we can, and attempt to forge a personal path that rings true to our genuinely held religious convictions.</p>
<p>I do harbor some concerns that our preference for the former over the latter is having a net negative impact on 21st century Orthodox Judaism. A society that looks for stringencies and looks down upon those with a different approach to Jewish law can become extremely uncomfortable for its non-conformist constituents. Autonomy and self confidence are authentic Torah values too. We ignore them at our peril.</p>
<p>This dispute might be a case study of this dichotomy or I might be completely off the mark, but either way, researching this topic inspired this idea in me. I believe there is a valid halachic path that permits the Shabbos Switch. I also acknowledge that this path will not be universally held. I think that&#8217;s okay. Variety and diversity can be good things. Let&#8217;s try to bring a little more of that back into our world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an ever-present tension between modernity and tradition, especially for Orthodox Jews in America. American culture places significance on tradition, yet manages to remain optimistic about new ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to be a fundamentalist. It&#8217;s easy to say everything new is wrong, or everything old is antiquated and bad. But I don&#8217;t believe that we should be looking for what&#8217;s easier. We should welcome the challenges of reconciling tradition and modernity. There is great beauty in using the new to improve the old, and the old to guide the new, without relying on extremes. <span id="more-8957"></span></p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s elections reminded me that the American system of government was revolutionary in the 18th century, our Constitution a groundbreaking document that charted a new course for politics around the world.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/05/judaism-needs-to-bring-back-the-tension-between-old-and-new-ideas/kinderhand-und-seniorenhand-child-hand-and-seniors-hand/" rel="attachment wp-att-8962"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/190846.jpeg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Kinderhand und Seniorenhand / Child hand and senior&#039;s hand" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8962" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> We revere the Constitution, and every law passed since its adoption must conform to a valid interpretation. That sounds a lot like Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The Torah was revolutionary around 2500 BCE. It remains a groundbreaking document that charted a new course for religion and theology around the world. We revere the Torah, and all of Jewish law must be based on valid interpretations. To an Orthodox Jew, some of the political tension between old and new feels familiar.</p>
<p>Thinking about this tension raises an interesting thought experiment. If we were starting a new country today, would we write the exact same constitution? Would Newmerica be the same country as Oldmerica?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve frozen time in 1789 and only allowed 27 changes in 225 years. I can&#8217;t help but think about how many other things have been completely discarded since 1789. What is the worldview that grants specialness to political theory from 1789? The &#8220;new&#8221; argument asks why we even bother holding onto a 225 year old vision.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can&#8217;t rewrite fundamental laws every day or even every year. One aspect of the argument in favor of traditionalism is how impracticable it would be to discard the old laws regularly, but this only works to a point. How long is long enough? Another &#8220;old&#8221; argument is that the laws seem to be working. Further, it could be argued that the Founding Fathers were especially smart and saw things in a unique way that renders their opinions superior to ours. But both of these arguments are incomplete and don&#8217;t fully respond to the issues raised by the &#8220;new&#8221; argument. Orthodox Judaism shares this tension with the United States.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this kind of tension leads to revolution. A revolution exclaims &#8220;the old is terrible and the new is good,&#8221; but an extreme reaction to extreme traditionalism is unlikely to yield balanced results. Presently, this tension is handled by Constitutional amendments and Supreme Court reinterpretation, which are ad hoc solutions. The real question is whether the Constitution reflects the best possible formulation of laws for our country today. Answering that would require a comparison between the Constitution and a comprehensive new effort; I&#8217;m not aware of any such effort. I imagine that some might even consider this heretical sounding notion a form of treason.</p>
<p>The current system of law in the United States is a masterful attempt to balance the need to change things with the need for continuity. It works pretty well, and the most important element to the success of a balanced approach that reveres the tradition and embraces modernity is an internal system checks and balances. Power cannot be reserved for the traditionalists, and it cannot be seized by revolutionaries. Both must coexist for optimal success.</p>
<p>This is part of our problem in Judaism today. We&#8217;ve all retreated to our own corners. In the past, we&#8217;ve had orthodoxies and reformers in Judaism, but we were operating within one system. Judaism evolved, but not too hastily. We melded our healthy skepticism of change with our yearning for relevance and flexibility. Then, about 150 years ago, the modernists and traditionalists stopped talking to each other and they stopped working within the same ecosystem. Orthodox Judaism and Reform Judaism were born. People who leaned toward tradition chose Orthodoxy, while people who leaned toward modernity chose Reform. The internal conversation ended. Orthodox Judaism lost significant progressive voices and seems like it was frozen in the 19th century. Reform Judaism felt little allegiance to the ways of old, and seems like it has no definitive doctrine and structure. We all lost.</p>
<p>Ironically, the future of modern Judaism requires that the &#8220;new&#8221; and the &#8220;old&#8221; go back to the traditional conversation of the past. In truth, tradition and modernity are symbiotic. We need to hear the best arguments from both sides in order to move ahead with a commitment to truth and Torah as we navigate the challenges of modernity. We need to go back to a large community that lives in the tension between the past and the future. That was our secret for centuries, and now it&#8217;s time to bring it back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Jews, Orthodox and non-Orthodox are left with a bitter taste in their mouths about the way Agudath Israel of America thinks about the non-Orthodox. In essence, their creed is something like &#8220;love the Jew, hate the Judaism.&#8221; It&#8217;s not precisely same as the &#8220;sins of sinners should be destroyed&#8221; of the Talmud. The modern version adds a few layers of contempt and derision above and beyond simply detesting the sin.</p>
<p>Although it should work intellectually, this kind of expression of love does not work for our hearts. We don&#8217;t appreciate it when people say &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but&#8230;&#8221; and we don&#8217;t like it when people say &#8220;I love you, but&#8230;&#8221; either. Whenever we temper statements that should be unequivocal, we make our statement less impactful. It can even completely undermine our starting premise when we qualify our emotional responses. &#8220;I love you, but&#8221; can sound a lot like &#8220;I don&#8217;t really love you.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://forward.com/articles/199363/why-love-the-jew-hate-the-judaism-is-so-wrong/" target="_blank">In the Forward</a>, Editor Jane Eisner engages this issue in a self-critical way.<span id="more-8458"></span> First she argues that in one sense, Rabbi Perlow is making a fair point. Secular Judaism may disappear because of intermarriage and assimilation. Just because it hurts to hear it, doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s not true. Further, Eisner claims that secular Jews make sweeping statements about Orthodox Jews that sound awfully similar to &#8220;love he Jew, hate the Judaism.&#8221; I admire Eisner&#8217;s candor and honest struggle with these issues. Seeing criticism in others is easier than seeing it in one&#8217;s own world. There are certainly similarities between the way both groups talk about each other.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Infinitylove-love-33175096-1920-1200.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8459" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Infinitylove-love-33175096-1920-1200.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Infinitylove-love-33175096-1920-1200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Of course there are differences too. The reason the Orthodox may hate the Judaism of the secular is almost always purely based on religious beliefs that may not be shared universally. The secular Jew who hates the Judaism of Orthodoxy may be coming from a place of liberalism and pluralism. They may feel that religious practices which are misogynistic or harmful to the emotional and physical wellbeing of other Jews are deserving of derision because of universal principles of fairness and humanism.</p>
<p>Either way, Eisner argues that non-Orthodox Jews must deal with the way they perceive the Orthodox Jew. Is it the same &#8220;love the Jew, hate the Judaism&#8221; as the Agudah? Indeed, it is close enough. Instead, Eisner suggests <em>&#8220;Love the Jew even if you don’t quite understand or endorse the Judaism.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I like it. But I don&#8217;t think it goes far enough.</p>
<p>In my community, whether on the beach or the Internet, I encounter this potential challenge on a regular basis. Here&#8217;s my approach: I just don&#8217;t bother with who is right and who is wrong. There is no moral judgment about another Jew&#8217;s Judaism. I do what I think is right and give others the same opportunity. If you do more or less or do it differently, it&#8217;s got nothing to do with my relationship to you as a person and as a fellow Jew. So my slogan is &#8220;I love you and what you do or think is irrelevant to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loving another person has as much to do with their preferred flavor of ice cream , favorite sports teams, and brand of soap as it has to one&#8217;s religious observance. They have nothing to do with each other. Don&#8217;t put them in the same sentence.</p>
<p>In other words, as I&#8217;ve said in other contexts, &#8220;Don&#8217;t make your relationship with others dependent on the other&#8217;s level and style of religious observance.&#8221; We simply divorce the two, really unrelated, ideas completely. It&#8217;s more a &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; than &#8220;love the sinner, hate the sin.&#8221; This approach makes our relationships about people. Religious debate and discussion can happen in an environment of mutual respect and comfort. We don&#8217;t lob grenades over the fence. Religious discussion can only take place in a safe and non-threatening manner.</p>
<p>The only caveat is if you harm others in a physical or emotional manner under the guise of religion or secularism, the rules change. If someone is hurting people, then we may be obligated to become judgmental. But again, it&#8217;s not because of the religious practices or preferences that we object or criticize. It&#8217;s because of their behavior, irrespective of religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Shavuot is a holiday of national pride and unity. It&#8217;s the day we celebrate the covenant of Torah with the Master of the World. This was the day that our national mission began. That&#8217;s our national pride. But that covenant required us to feel connected to each other. Our rabbis teach us that we were of one heart.</p>
<p>One heart. Our hearts beat together. We express love for each other. Unity comes when we are able to connect our hearts together. Unity does not require that we be of one mind. That&#8217;s not even a factor.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s room for right and wrong opinions in Judaism. But our love for one another has nothing to do with our religious beliefs and opinions. That&#8217;s all in the mind. Unity is in the heart. In the heart there is no place for debate and argument. The heart is where we express our unbridled, unconditional, untempered love for our brothers and sisters. &#8220;I love you&#8221; without qualification and without compromise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Data. The Internet has made data collection easier and the quantification of data simpler. For a while, access to data was a novelty and just presenting a one sided account of some data was exciting. But now, data is so prevalent that understanding and contextualizing data is more interesting. Several websites purporting to analyze data as opposed to pontificate subjectively on topics have cropped up recently.</p>
<p>Perhaps the shift could be simplified by saying we&#8217;ve moved from Malcolm Gladwell and blogging pundits to Nate Silver and thevox.com.</p>
<p>But Orthodox Jewish commentary is basically in the pre-Gladwell era. We don&#8217;t even have any data. And if we did have data, we don&#8217;t even have anyone to analyze it properly. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/02/10/some-lessons-orthodox-judaism-can-learn-from-mormons/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve lamented this before</a>, and note that there has been some headway in our data collection aspirations. In the meantime, we still pontificate and argue from subjective and anecdotal perspectives. There is still value in such discussion, but it&#8217;s all very theoretical and hardly scientific.</p>
<p>Which is why I was so intrigued by this book I noticed (I can&#8217;t remember where) and was eager to devour its data. The book is titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199948658/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199948658&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=FO6EHLMYUPOJ6AFV">Families and Faith: How Religion is Passed Down across Generations</a> and it was worth every penny it cost and every minute I spent reading it.</p>
<p><span id="more-8375"></span></p>
<p>The concept of the book is enough to make me swoon. Imagine talking to 5 generations of American families about their religious identity (or lack thereof) several times over the course of 30 years and tracking their responses along numerous data points. Then taking time to quantify the data and interpret the numbers to produce evidence based opinions on the factors that influence the effectiveness of passing religious traditions from one generation to the next. That&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199948658/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199948658&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=FO6EHLMYUPOJ6AFV">Families and Faith</a>. Every major religion is represented in the data. Non-belief and atheism is also analyzed in the same way belief is analyzed.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/05/05/book-review-families-and-faith/"><img class="alignright wp-image-8376 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/thumbRNS-FAMILIES-FAITH112113.jpg?resize=393%2C600" alt="RNS-FAMILIES-FAITH" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In terms of sheer value, the data in this book is incredibly useful. The numbers in the book are meaningful and the analysis is excellent. People discussed in the book span 125 years. It was an ambitious study when it was conceived over 30 years ago, and the results of the study reflect this ambition. I don&#8217;t think I have ever seen more relevant data on this particular issue. But it&#8217;s not just charts and tables of numbers. The numbers are accompanied by snippets and quotes from thousands of conversations that illuminate the numbers. This was not a survey with questions and answers. The survey is numbers and personal testimony. It tells a very complex and nuanced story of religious tradition. For this reason alone, I think a copy of this belongs in every rabbi&#8217;s library, every Jewish school&#8217;s library, and the library of anyone who cares about the future of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>You should read the book to see all the numbers and commentary. But in the interest of providing some food for thought, I present some of the most interesting conclusions reached in the study and discussed in the book.</p>
<p>1. <strong>The most important factor in transmitting tradition is the relationship between parents and children</strong>. This is not to say that parents are to blame if a child deviates. This is only to say that children who enjoy a warm, positive relationship with their parents have a much higher rate of keeping the traditions of the parents. Numbers only demonstrate trends and tendencies. When the book identifies this as an important factor, it only means that this is a data point that is more common among those who stay. Of course many who stay dislike their parents and many who leave love their parents. But the numbers are significant enough that this is considered an important factor.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Grandparents matter a lot. </strong>Previous studies failed to identify the influence of grandparents. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199948658/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199948658&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=FO6EHLMYUPOJ6AFV">Families and Faith</a> demonstrates the huge impact that grandparents can have on their grandchildren. Nostalgia and a connection to the old world make a difference in children. This makes it somewhat more difficult for children of Baalei Teshuva who have grandparents antagonistic to the choices of their parents. Support from grandparents makes a big difference. Losing it, makes a big difference too.</p>
<p>3. <strong>God and religion mean different things to different generations. </strong>It&#8217;s predictable, but important to note that the way religious people talk about God and the meaning of their religious experience is different across generations. This is not a factor in whether people stay, but it is important for parents and educators to be aware that the way that they perceive spirituality is likely different than the way their children and students perceive spirituality. Thus, in the interest of good communication, we need know that the language of religious people changes. Reading through the Jewish tradition, this is fairly obvious. Where one generation related to God through <em>piyut, </em>another generation related to God through <em>pilpul. </em>These things change and I think that they tend to change faster now than they changed in the past.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Allowing religious choice encourages children who struggle with religion to return. </strong>To some, this is counter-intuitive. But I think we&#8217;ve all seen this one in action. The more a community tries to clamp down on rebellious teens, the less likely they are to return. I wonder if there is even a single example of actively suppressing rebelliousness that worked out well for the parents. I can&#8217;t think of one. Sometimes there is a brief respite, but the result is usually predictable. But the interesting thing is that when given a choice and an opportunity to explore, there are a significant number of children who return to the religion of their parents over time.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Parents who become more religious while raising their children. </strong>Often, parents will get more involved in religious life or introduce more religious practices into the family life as their grow older. This has a negative effect on children according to the data. Parents experiencing personal growth within their religious lives is part of religious life. But the consequences can be harmful if the parents impose their newfound fervor on their children. I think this is an area that is relevant to Orthodox Jews in particular.</p>
<p>6. Finally, I think this is the hidden message of the entire book. <strong>Parents have as much influence over their children as they have always had</strong><strong>.</strong> In other words, it&#8217;s too common and too easy to say that it&#8217;s harder to raise religious children in 2014 than it was in 1974 or 1914. But the numbers actually say that parents have the same influence they had in the past. The defeatism of throwing up our hands and saying we can&#8217;t win is not admitted defeat. It&#8217;s a false confession.</p>
<p>There is so much more data, discussion, and conclusions in this book of great importance and I think everyone should read it. I really do.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that we can artificially generate the right circumstances to pass faith on to our children. But we can teach the values and practices that make it easier so that over time we have organically cultivated the right environment for transmission of faith. Jewish families were part of the survey, but underrepresented. We need to do our own research and learn what works for us and what isn&#8217;t working. I hope to pursue this path sometime in the future, in the meantime we have  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199948658/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199948658&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=FO6EHLMYUPOJ6AFV">Families and Faith</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Atlantic takes note of a growing class of Americans. Fewer people identify as religious, but more people identify as spiritual. It&#8217;s far more common to believe in God than it is to be affiliated with a religion. Over 30% of people under 30 claim no religious preference. This might sound like they are all atheists. But over 70% of these same people who are not part of any religion believe in God.</p>
<p>Historically, these sort of people were dismissed. They were considered not to be serious about life and social issues. This might be changing. The article in The Atlantic argues that the political party that is able to tap into the needs of this emerging group will gain an advantage in future elections.</p>
<p>I see this trend in a different light.<span id="more-8055"></span></p>
<p>There are two main groups of religious people. One group is very spiritual. They follow God&#8217;s instructions in order that they should achieve spiritual gain. Perhaps they are interested in the spiritual rewards of the afterlife. Or maybe they are just afraid of the burning fires of hell. These people pay attention to what I call the Giant Scoreboard in the Sky. Others believe that every good deed they do will affect the world in a spiritual way. A sort of spiritual butterfly effect or religious form of Karma.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/photo-28.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8056" alt="photo (28)" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/photo-28.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The second group is more concerned with tangible effects of religious observance. They see God&#8217;s instructions as a moral imperative to act in a way that improves their lives and the lives of the people around them. This groups believes that the spiritual benefits to religious practice are unknowable and undetectable so they prefer to focus on the more social benefits of their religion.</p>
<p>To illustrate: One person might accept Jesus as their God and savior because they want to be spared eternal damnation. Another person might believe in Jesus because it enables them to be a better friend or spouse. Same result, but different motivations.</p>
<p>Another example: One person might keep the Sabbath because they know that keeping the Sabbath is good for the spiritual state of the universe and they will reap the rewards of this spiritual activity in the next world. Someone else might keep the Sabbath because they think God&#8217;s instruction that we rest one day per week will be good for them because it will give them an opportunity to focus on religious activity and their family. Same result, but different motivations.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think either of these paradigms are absolute. Some people will mix and match elements from both groups in their observance. I also think both of these paradigms are acceptable. Some people would never be able to adhere to religion if they had to go all in on either of these ideas. Some people are spiritually averse. Others need spirituality to sustain their observance.</p>
<p>But I think that the rise of spiritualists who do not believe in religion slightly threatens the second group. If more people become spiritualists and fewer people carry the mantle of appreciation for the social benefits of religion it will become harder and harder to sustain the second group.</p>
<p>Even if it&#8217;s not a threat per se, it indicates a trend toward more spiritual forms of religions. My own anecdotal experiences corroborate this trend. I notice more and more people taking an interest in more spiritually centric forms of Judaism. If the words &#8220;mystical,&#8221; &#8220;kabbalah,&#8221; or &#8220;secret&#8221; appear in the title to a class it generates more interest than a title without those words. When people meet me for the first time and they ask questions about Judaism, they are skewed toward the spiritual side of things. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this of course, but for people who fit more neatly into our second group, it can be alienating.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that this is all happening while the world is also trending away from belief and religion. It seems that the more atheism and rejection of God our world experiences, the more we see an increased interest in more spiritual forms of religion. It makes perfect sense. If there is a fear that too much rational or scientific thinking might lead people to atheism, it stands to reason that religions will prefer to focus on their more spiritual sides. And so we see an increased infusion of spirituality among people with no religious affiliation as well as within religions themselves.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great that people who opt our of religion are not giving up on God and they are finding spiritual fulfillment in unorganized religion. Many non-Orthodox Jewish communities follow a similar path. It&#8217;s a good thing overall. However, there are some consequences to consider as well. Less spiritual religious people might find they have less and less in common with other believers and that could become a problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that we ensure that both groups have a place in our religious communities. We can&#8217;t change human nature. So while many people feel intimately tied into the spiritual cosmos and it seems to be more popular now than ever before, others do not. Those people can&#8217;t be forced into seeing or feeling spirituality. It&#8217;s just impossible to legislate feelings. These people need the other kind of religion. Let&#8217;s make sure it doesn&#8217;t become extinct.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a great article in the NY Times last week about nostalgia. I believe that nostalgia is a very important element of the religious experience. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/21/the-magical-secret-of-the-seder/">The Magical Secret of the Seder</a>)</p>
<p>I had no idea that until recently nostalgia was considered a mental disorder. Apparently, it was thought to be akin to depression. But people who were nostalgic were not sad and so research commenced to determine the proper classification and function of nostalgia.</p>
<p>It turns out that nostalgia is actually pretty useful. Studies have shown that nostalgia can make people feel happier, can physically warm the body, can give people hope, and overall improve one&#8217;s life. This all serves very important evolutionary purposes. Modernly, it helps with relationships in general and in particular with marriage. Good memories make for good relationships.<span id="more-7393"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7394" alt="V7K1cJRPaafgLZP" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/V7K1cJRPaafgLZP.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Looking at nostalgia through the lens of the religious person, nostalgia becomes even more useful. If our religion gives us good memories and makes us feel good when we are young it is going to be important to us to relive those memories year to year and life event to life event. Even more importantly, it motivates us to give our children similar experiences. We want our children to look fondly upon their youth and we want religion to be front and center in their positive memories.</p>
<p>I think we should cultivate good memories. We should create our own nostalgia. We should actively mine those memories for good feelings towards people, family, spouses, and of course religion. Jewish holidays are perfect for this kind of work but really it should be a full time effort.</p>
<p>All this leads me to two issues that are plaguing the orthodox Jewish community right now.</p>
<p>Victims of sex abuse invoke many coping mechanisms to deal with the betrayal and violence of the crimes perpetrated against them. Obviously, if the abuser is an authority or religious figure, the victim&#8217;s associations with religion become supremely negative. There is little religious nostalgia for victims. Even worse, is when the coping mechanism involves repressing memories of one&#8217;s childhood. Some victims cannot even remember their childhood. Clearly, these victims have no nostalgia towards their religion. They may stay in the fold for other reasons, but an important part of their religious experience is left with a gaping hole instead of positive memories. Aside from robbing children of their innocence and inflicting untold pain of their victims, predators paint over their victim&#8217;s childhood memories with a very big, very dark brush. This has many negative consequences, including religious consequences.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have witnessed there is a recent spate of <i>baalei teshuva </i>returning to their prior lives and leaving orthodox Judaism. This group also lacks the nostalgia of an orthodox Jewish upbringing. This is not a defect. It can be a difference that does not make a distinction. But for some people, it can be hard to stay in the orthodox Jewish community and for some of those people nostalgia is a decent motivating factor. Unfortunately, those who choose to become orthodox later in life lack this secret weapon. Sometimes that can make all the difference in the world between staying or leaving.</p>
<p>The article in the NY Times corroborates what I think is a very underappreciated part of being an orthodox Jew. Nostalgia. Those who are missing it, whether because of despicable violence or courage to choose orthodox Judaism are often missing this non-essential ingredient. But we all have the power to give it to our children and I contend that it&#8217;s a very worthwhile endeavor.</p>

<p>The best book I read this year was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists: A Non-believer&#8217;s Guide to the Uses of Religion</a> by Alain de Botton. The author is a Jewish atheist and apparently a direct descendant of the author of the Lechem Mishnah commentary on Maimonides&#8217; Mishnah Torah. The book is excellent and I highly recommend that everyone read it.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the book is written for atheists. I think believers should read this book at least as much as atheists should read it. The book tries to show that there is a lot that atheists can learn from religion. Generally speaking, de Botton argues that even if religion is  complete bunk there is a reason it developed, evolved, and flourishes. There are evolutionary needs that religion addresses. Religion serves a very important role in the scheme of man&#8217;s existence and when people abandon religion as atheists, they risk losing the very important evolutionary benefits of religion.</p>
<p>In other words, atheists cannot abandon the principles of religion simply because they disbelieve in God. In fact, it almost makes no sense to do that. An atheist must believe that religion evolved as a response to a human need because the atheists does not believe that religion could possibly be a revelation from God since God does not exist according to the atheist! It follows that according to atheists, religion is a human response to some innate needs and its development and success are vital to the success and progress of humanity. Excising religion from the human experience may be necessary for the atheist, but it is fraught with risks. There are elements of religion that are necessary for human development and without religion, those needs may not be met.<span id="more-6667"></span></p>
<p>So the book then goes on to describe some of the humanistic benefits of various religions. Most of the focus is on Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. I found the references to Judaism very fascinating and enlightening. The author even uses some of the harshest victims of atheistic criticism as examples of worthy ideas that should be emulated. For example, he uses mikvah, (yes mikvah!), as an example of attaching ritual and meaning to washing. He says that there is something valuable in attaching bathing to renewal and associating outer washing with inner purity. As orthodox Jews, we may scoff at this humanistic approach to mikvah and it may not be sufficient to allay some of the discomfort that some orthodox Jewish women have with mikvah, but it is refreshing to see a non-believer try to find beauty and meaning in this practice.</p>
<p>Another great example in the book is his section on forgiveness. Yom Kippur is an ingenious way of reconnecting people. It is a day where we are forced to reconcile with our past. Non-believers need such a day as well.</p>
<p>Most importantly, religion creates community and responsibility toward one another. The book mentions Jewish weddings and Bar Mitzvah celebrations as important rituals within a community that should be emulated by non-believers.</p>
<p>The follow up point to each example is that atheists must create analogous practices and rituals for their lives in order to satisfy their needs that are not being met by the absence of religion in their lives. The book proposes cathedrals for atheists, yearly celebrations of bounty, and other corollaries to religious practices for atheists. The proposals are fantastic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mostly theoretical book because I don&#8217;t see how any of this would every come into being. But if it would happen, I think it would be great for society.</p>
<p>Although the book is written for atheists, I think there is something important here for believers as well. We need to appreciate the depth and beauty of our religious practices. We need to see how to a non-believer many of our practices are useful even if God did not exist. To us, who believe God does exist, the benefits of religion are even greater. We need to appreciate how incredibly useful our religion is to our psyche and wellbeing and we need to thank God for giving us such a wonderful way of life to satisfy those needs. This is the true value of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> to the believer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not recommending orthopraxy. I am suggesting that the believer take into account all that religion does for the believer in a religious but also in a secular, psychological, and evolutionary way. We need to realize that what we are doing was given to us by God and it goes beyond just ritual or Divine command that has no non-religious benefit. We should acknowledge and explore the potential humanistic reasons for practicing orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The book also can serve as a bit of a bridge between atheists and believers. It gives us common ground and serves as an antidote to the Dawkins inspired derision of religion. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to see a debate between Dawkins and de Botton. I also wish the Chief Rabbi would have read this book and incorporated some of its lessons in his Op-Ed earlier this week.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> enough. It is a great book for believers and non-believers alike.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6262" title="sacks" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks.jpg?resize=300%2C187" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I deeply admire Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks. It is with great interest that I watched his BBC Television program on Science vs. Religion. I really enjoyed it, but found it a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>The premise is that Rabbi Sacks is on a mission to open dialogue with premier British scientists. The production value is high and it is an enjoyable program. (Although I can&#8217;t for the life of me understand why the YouTube video is not in HD and appears squished.) The show is from his perspective. This means that it edited and cut to his liking. This is fine, but it severely limits the objectivity of the show.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch intelligent people talking about important things, but clearly the content is dumbed down for a broad audience.<span id="more-6261"></span></p>
<p>The best segment is the Richard Dawkins segment. Rabbi Sacks challenges Dawkins and Dawkins challenges the Rabbi. Neither of them really answer each other&#8217;s questions. It&#8217;s a little frustrating to the viewer who actually wants to see highly intelligent people debate.</p>
<p>But the value in this video lies not only in the actual questions and answers, its value lies in the acknowledgement that there are questions that science cannot answer and that there are questions that religion cannot answer.</p>
<p>The one thing that bothered me in watching this video how many times scientists challenged Rabbi Sacks about the &#8220;truth&#8221; of Torah and religion and Rabbi Sacks did not answer them with a clear response. I don&#8217;t know if he has a clear response, but there was none in the video.</p>
<p>But there was much to like.</p>
<p>I like how Dawkins differentiates between Darwinism to explain our existence and his refusal to use Social Darwinism to create society. I loved how Rabbi Sacks pounces on this as a way of showing that bad science can be just as damaging as bad religion. Then Rabbi Sacks uses Dawkins&#8217; response to this to show that there is common ground between Religion and Science in that we all share certain values and in those areas we should work together to ensure those mutual goals are met and not foiled by bad religion or bad science. Dawkins is even willing to work together toward common goals.</p>
<p>How many times have I said the same kind of thing with regard to atheism, other religions, secular Judaism, progressive religious Judaism and traditional religious Judaism? I agree with this vehemently. There are many problems that plague us all. Many of the solutions to those problems can be found in religion and science.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sacks ends the program with a soliloquy on the &#8220;power of the conversation&#8221;. This is my mantra as well. The Internet is a place to have that conversation but it must carry over to world of human interaction. We need to enable this kind of conversation as much as we possibly can.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that we need to have the same conversation about science and religion. I mean that we need to have conversations between all of humankind on matters upon which we agree. Those areas are so broad and vast and in those areas we can all contribute. The secular world has much to learn from religion and its values. Religion has much to gain from science. Let&#8217;s not allow our differences to get in the way of progress for mankind.</p>
<p>As we begin a new Jewish year, let us commit to opening dialogue between all people of faiths and creeds for a better tomorrow.</p>

This time she has been published by the NY Times in their Opinionator Blog.</p>
<p>The article teaches an important lesson in tolerance. We tend to focus on our differences. I know I am certainly guilty of this. Everyone is guilty of it. The best tool in our arsenal of building tolerance and creating bridges is to focus on our similarities. When we see other people who look so different or who affiliate themselves so differently, we tend to zone in on those stark differences.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t it true that we are much more alike than we are different?<span id="more-6227"></span></p>
<p>With fellow Jews, we share much more than we realize sometimes. Often the people we like least are the people that are closest to us ideologically. But that is not a reason to hate someone else. That should be a ton of reasons to like someone else.</p>
<p>With members of other faiths we also share so much. Sure we disagree on some things, but overall we agree on a lot. This is the key to interfaith relations.</p>
<p>With secular people we share so much. Sure we disagree on a few big name items, but we agree on many things. If we can focus on the things upon which we agree, a lot of the anger and disdain will fall away. There is absolutely no reason that religious and secular people cannot work together on projects and ideas that are compatible with our mutually held beliefs.</p>
<p>The 20th century and the early 21st century brought strong feelings of nationalism. As the world shrunk, people needed to self identify more strongly with their ethnicity or religion. People were introduced to new cultures and ways of life that they never new existing. It created existential angst. In response, people retreated to their more tribal instincts as they needed a way to set themselves apart. The world suffered through several wars as a result of this nationalism and exclusionary philosophy.</p>
<p>Yet, the world continued to shrink and people continue to create imaginary lines between themselves and others as a defense mechanism to the world shrinking. It doesn&#8217;t make us stronger as individuals. It does not make our communities or religious groups stronger. It does not make society stronger.</p>
<p>Weakening our ties to each other weakens the human race in every possible way. The first step to making things right is recognizing what is highlighted in this article.</p>
<p>Go read it. Then take its lesson to heart.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/murder_mystery-puzzle.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6155" title="murder_mystery-puzzle" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/murder_mystery-puzzle.png?resize=300%2C225" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This summer has been a particularly violent summer in the USA. At least to my mind, there have been more reported acts of politicized public violence and mayhem than usual.</p>
<p>Aurora, the Sikh Temple, Texas A&amp;M, and now the Family Research Council, are all very public examples of gunmen and violence.</p>
<p>As with everything in life, there are many prisms with which to view this violence and its social ramifications. I have taken an interest in the reactions after the shootings. It seems that the most important thing to establish is whether the gunman was liberal or conservative. The next thing to do is to show how liberalism or conservatism is the reason that the gunmen killed innocent people. The next step is to proclaim the ideology of the gunmen an ideology of violence and barbarism.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see this from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a similar exercise in futilty in debates between believers and non-believers. That argument usually follows the very logical path of analysis that attributes historical and contemporary violence to fervent religious beliefs. Events like the Inquisition, Crusades, and  violence associated with Jihad are favorite examples used to prove this point.</p>
<p>In my opinion, all of these analyses are extremely superficial and contain numerous fallacies.<span id="more-6154"></span></p>
<p>Systematic killing is not a relevant discussion to sporadic violence. There is a systematic killing in some places in the world. It so happens that those places are third world countries that do not value life in the same way more civilized countries value life. So comparing militants in the Sudan to a shooter at the FRC in DC is a complete non-sequitur. Violent outbursts in modern society are not the same kind of killings as systematic killings which were mostly done for the sake of power or position and they leveraged religion to accomplish those goals. But that is not our concern. It does not tell us anything about violent martyrs who kill for a cause expecting to die.</p>
<p>The reason people kill other people is very complex. There are many factors that contribute to a human being taking the life of another. Certainly one needs motivation and political position or religious beliefs may provide motivation. But at its core, taking the life of another is an extremely anti-social behavior. It takes a specific kind of person to kill another, even for the sake of one&#8217;s beliefs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that an ideology can transform a normal functioning person into a sociopathic killer. The gap between &#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;murderer&#8221; is far too wide a gap to be crossed by adding <em>only</em> ideology. Further, let&#8217;s assume that less than .0001% of society murders other people. Meaning, for argument&#8217;s sake, one out of every one million people is a murderer. Personally, I think that is high, but let&#8217;s go with it. If religion or a specific political stance is so evil it causes murder, it is extremely ineffective at doing so. In other words, with so few murderers in society, it seems improbable to blame something as common as religion or political beliefs for murder.</p>
<p>Sure, many murderers hold extreme positions. But that is not what caused them to murder. Rather, the same thing that draws them to extremism is the thing that allows them to act in such an anti-social manner. To put it bluntly, people who kill other people are crazy. That is the starting point. Do crazy people believe in crazy things? Absolutely. But their beliefs are not what makes them crazy. Their beliefs are a symptom of their craziness, just as murder is a symptom of their craziness.</p>
<p>If there was no religion and if there were no politics, crazy people would still exist. And crazy people with access, opportunity, and motivation will sometimes kill other people.</p>
<p>So do me a favor. Please. Stop telling me about murderers who were socialists or liberals or libertarians or social conservatives or Christians, or Muslims, or Atheists, or Whatever. That is not relevant to their heinous murderous ways. People from all walks of life with all kinds of beliefs have been known to kill other people. More extreme groups will have more extreme people who have murderous tendencies. The beliefs don&#8217;t make them crazy, their craziness draws them to the beliefs.</p>
<p>The important thing that we should analyze about murderers is their mental health. We don&#8217;t need to eliminate religion or politics to stop murder in modern society, we need to deal with mental illness more aggressively and more effectively.</p>

I always find this kind of thing fascinating as it helps to explain certain features of religion.</p>
<p>According to Britannica, ritual is the performance of ceremonial acts prescribed by tradition or by sacerdotal (as relating to priests) decree.</p>
<p>Religion is heavy on ritual. Perhaps in Judaism ritual plays a larger role than in other religions simply due to the huge number of commandments and customs. In Judaism much of the ritual comes directly from God. But plenty of ritual in Judaism is man made. Some were made intentionally, but many others developed over time almost by accident with little or no religious value.</p>
<p>The presence of that third category, &#8220;rituals that developed over time almost by accident&#8221; tells us that ritual is not just a God made construct. Humans create rituals too. The research and observation supports this theory.<span id="more-6114"></span></p>
<p>First of all, non-religious people have non-religious rituals. The research also demonstrates that people will engage in rituals for the sake of healing and salvation even if they are positive that the ritual will have no effect on the situation. They will even abandon logical, practical ideas that are more likely to help in favor of what they know to be meaningless rituals. Incredible.</p>
<p>This means that the need for ritual is so deeply ingrained in our psyche that we value ritual and its supernatural reasoning. It does something for us even if it has no effect on the target of the ritual. Some rituals, without context and experience can seem downright bizarre. Others make more sense to us.</p>
<p>Judaism with its many rituals, also urges us to pursue scientific routes to recovery and assistance. We are told not to rely on the supernatural. We utilize both ritual and practical methodologies in our lives.</p>
<p>Many of the Torah&#8217;s commandments are associated with rituals. We are told that some of them are expected to yield results, whether in this existence or some sort of spiritual existence. But it can be hard to see those benefits. Some people will abandon the commandments and their rituals because they see no tangible results from them.</p>
<p>A tenet of almost all religions, Judaism included, is that prayer works. God can respond to human needs and requests. But sometimes it can feel like we are being ignored or that the answer is simply &#8220;no&#8221;. For some people, that can be frustrating. Some people might think that since prayer can seem futile, it should be abandoned completely.</p>
<p>The science says otherwise. There is value in the rituals. The rituals serve a need within us to have regular, expected responses to pain and suffering. The rituals give us a way to express joy and appreciation. These are very important human needs. Every religion and culture has these features. We need to appreciate the role these rituals play in our religious and non-religous lives. In its infinite wisdom, the Torah provides us so many opportunities to develop our ritual repertoire. We can believe that they make a cosmic difference but we can also acknowledge that they are useful for other reasons as well. We must cherish these rituals and not allow ourselves to see them as a burden.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/F1.medium.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5470" title="F1.medium" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/F1.medium.gif?resize=235%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=losing-your-religion-analytic-thinking-can-undermine-belief" target="_blank">news outlets reported</a> the findings of a recent article in the Science journal that showed analytic thinking promotes religious disbelief. Intrigued, I got my hands on the article and while I do not profess to understand the math involved, I am capable of understanding the methodology and social science that explains the findings.</p>
<p>I suggest reading the article to get an idea of how the conclusions of the article were reached. Here is a basic summary:</p>
<p>There are two basic cognitive faculties that we use to make decisions. We use our intuition and we use analysis. In general, religious beliefs are reached using intuition. Analysis is not as commonly used to reach religious belief.</p>
<p>The study attempted to prove that there is not merely a correlation between analytical thinking and disbelief of religion, but there is also causation. The more analytically one thinks, the less one will possess religious beliefs. The study successfully proved that there is a correlation and causation between the two.<span id="more-5469"></span></p>
<p>The basic idea behind the experiments was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)" target="_blank">prime</a> random volunteers to think analytically and measure the difference between their responses to questions about their religious beliefs and contrast those with unprimed test subjects. The results, if I can trust their math, were conclusive. There is correlation and there is causation at least in the specific examples used in the study. The religious &#8220;test&#8221; was very general and did not test specific religious beliefs. Rather it tested belief in God or Supernatural agents and the like.</p>
<p>And so, the religious person is met with a challenge. Is it reasonable to believe in something that correlates with lack of analytical thinking and that analytical thinking causes it to be disbelieved?</p>
<p>The first, more obvious response is simple. Who says that analytical thinking is better, more correct, truer, smarter, etc., than intuition?  Clearly, for some things, analytical thinking is superior. But there is no rule that states that analytical thinking is always superior to intuition. Therefore, accepting the results of this study only tell us that intuition is a far better tool for religious beliefs than analysis.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a cop out answer. I admit. That&#8217;s because we almost always prefer analysis to intuition when we make important decisions. Also, intuition is more influenced by our subconscious and particularly, by our &#8220;religious baseline&#8221; which includes, childhood experiences and community.</p>
<p>I think I may have a better answer. Most people think that religion answers the unanswered questions. We call this the God of the Gaps. In ancient times, explanations were needed for a lot of things, and so religious beliefs and superstitions provided those explanations. What is fire? What is thunder? Why does it rain? Why do people get sick? What happens when you die? All these (and hundreds more) unanswered questions were answered by religion.</p>
<p>As questions became answered, the God of Gaps got smaller and smaller. In response, some religious people abandoned religion, others were confident in the few remaining unanswered questions, while the rest doubled down on their beliefs and proclaimed science the enemy and false.</p>
<p>I think, and I have no way of proving this, that most religious people over the course of history believed in the God of the Gaps.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that if one&#8217;s belief in God is based upon unanswered questions, increased analytical thinking will promote disbelief. After all, the belief system is built upon not understanding thinking analytically. Many of the core beliefs of religious people are actually impossible or scientifically demonstrated to be false. It follows, that reason and analysis will debunk these ideas in practice, and in the background of one consciousness through priming as the study found.</p>
<p>However, I do not believe in the God of the Gaps. Nor is any orthodox Jew required to believe in the God of the Gaps. Even if we could understand everything in the entire universe, God would still have a role in Judaism. God&#8217;s role is the Maker of it all. The One who put the stuff there in the first place. And the One who cares about what happens to it all.</p>
<p>The existence of God and God&#8217;s instructions function outside the common area of intuition and analysis. They are a separate mode of thinking. They cannot be proved nor are they intuitive. They function in a completely different way. It is beyond the scope of this post to propose what kind of thinking justifies religious belief. But I do not think that this study ask an unanswerable question, to borrow a phrase, for all religious people.</p>
<p>The orthodox Jew should not allow analytical thinking affect his belief in God. Our belief does not depend on unanswered questions or unexplainable phenomena. So as more questions are answered by science we should not feel threatened. Thus, the view that analytical thinking promotes disbelief in religion should come as no surprise to us, nor should it be perceived as any threat.</p>
<p>We have a strong tradition of asking question, challenging ideas, and thinking analytically. We should continue to embrace this tradition and not be afraid of what we might learn or discover as we are confident that we have the truth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Torah-Scroll-text-silver-yad.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5399" title="Torah-text" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Torah-Scroll-text-silver-yad.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A few weeks ago, Stanley Fish wrote a two part series in the NY Times about science, religion, belief, and evidence. Fish makes the argument that science has jumped the shark and is no different than religion at this point. His proof is from a statement made by Richard Dawkins. In my opinion, Fish is 100% wrong.</p>
<p>In an interview on MSNBC, Dawkins was explaining that science is not based on belief, rather it is based on facts and demonstrable evidence. To bolster his point he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230; in the arena of science you can invoke Professor So-and-So’s study published in 2008, you can actually cite <strong>chapter and verse</strong>.&#8221;<span id="more-5397"></span></em></p>
<p>Fish then goes on to say that since Dawkins invokes the terminology so often used by religion &#8211; &#8220;chapter and verse&#8221;, he is in effect showing his hand and science has become faith based just like religion. In other words, citing chapter and verse in a scientific journal is an appeal to authority much the same way citing chapter and verse in the Bible is an appeal to authority. Fish argues that science is supposed to be based on evidence not an appeal to authority. Once it becomes cited by chapter and verse, it becomes faith based just like religion.</p>
<p>This is a common argument made by religious people. I have no idea if Stanley Fish is religious or not, but this is not a new argument. The premise of the argument is that proving something by citing a document is qualitatively the same when the document is a scientific paper and when the document is a religious text.</p>
<p>Fish got a million and half emails telling him he was wrong. So he doubled down and tried to explain himself in Part 2. To accomplish this, Fish engages in some sophisticated sophistry and linguistics to sat that there is no such thing as evidence in science nor is there such a thing as data. Really, we can know nothing so science is a circle of fervent believers in a self-fulfilling club. Plus, there might not be an objective truth so science and religion can both be true.</p>
<p>It sounds nutty because it is.</p>
<p>Science is different than religion. Its works can be cited as evidence while religious texts cannot. There is a very good reason for this. A scientific paper uses logic, reason, demonstrable evidence, and experimentation to make its points. Once something has been proved or accepted as a valid scientific principle it no longer needs to be &#8220;proved&#8221; each time it is invoked. It can be cited as chapter and verse for expediency and efficiency of argument. You don&#8217;t have to believe in anything to use science as evidence. However, citing chapter and verse from a religious text is completely circular. The religious text may be false, subjectively interpreted, or invented by humans. There is no authority attached to the text unless one subjectively gives the text that authority. It is exactly like citing a work of fiction as authority.</p>
<p>Fish is correct that there is much to learn from sacred texts even if they are works of fiction. Literary criticism is an important discipline and can teach us a lot about our world and provide great lessons for life. But they are subjective lessons and personal to each individual. They cannot be cited as objective authority. This is why citing chapter and verse to religious texts is not as convincing as citing chapter and verse in a scientific study. One is objective, the other subjective.</p>
<p>As a believer, I find my religious texts binding and authoritative. I can, and should cite religious texts when discussing my religious beliefs with fellow believers. But if I am arguing with a non-believer, those religious texts are not only irrelevant, they are weak when compared with science. If I want to make a point to a non-believer I need objective data. I can cite chapter and verse to a study to make an objective argument. I cannot cite chapter and verse to a religious text to make an objective argument.</p>
<p>It is counter-productive for believers to think their beliefs are able to be proved objectively. This only engenders a false sense of security, condescension towards non-believers or believers in other religions, and vulnerability to the difficulties presented by objective inquiry into religious beliefs. Instead, believers should emphasize that their religion is a framework for dealing with life&#8217;s challenges and its religious texts are valuable to those who believe in them. When determining whether it is reasonable to believe in an ancient text whose Authorship cannot be proved, one should take all factors into account and accept that in the end, belief in God or ancient texts will never be as compelling or convincing as a scientific study but that does not really matter.</p>
<p>Just because a scientist used the words &#8220;chapter and verse&#8221; in an argument does not make science a new faith based religion. Science and religion answer different questions using different methodologies. Pretending they are the same or similar in their approach to evidence is a fallacy that helps no one.</p>

But it wasn&#8217;t enough to preach to the choir (hehe) and reaffirm their atheist beliefs. Dawkins urged the 20,000 in attendance to ridicule religion and show contempt for religion.</p>
<p>This is further than previous calls to action by atheists. It used to be enough to challenge believers to debate, publish books and articles, but now Dawkins wants atheists to verbally attack religious people. Let me get right out and say it, this is really really bad idea.<span id="more-5330"></span></p>
<p>Now, I do sympathize with many of the ideas that Dawkins teaches. I think that politics and government policy should not be decided by religious beliefs. This is not because I think religious beliefs are inherently bad or wrong, in fact, I am in favor of many religious beliefs. I am a religious person myself. I think religion can and should play a strong an important role in our lives. But I don&#8217;t think it is fair or correct for one particular religion to rule our thinking and public policy. Every religion has mutually exclusive beliefs and all religious beliefs are exclusive of atheist beliefs. Our government should not favor one over the other. On this, Dawkins and I somewhat agree.</p>
<p>But now Dawkins is pushing harder. He is no longer simply concerned with eliminating religious beliefs from government, he wants to eliminate religion. Period. Not only does he want to eliminate religion but he wants atheists to be confrontational and to mock religious people.</p>
<p>There are a few problems with this proposal.</p>
<p>First of all, in my experience very little comes from confrontation. Most people reinforce their beliefs when confronted or ridiculed.</p>
<p>Second of all, if the platform of atheist is reason and rationality then mocking others hardly reinforces that notion. Stick to your principles, don&#8217;t resort to bully tactics.</p>
<p>Third of all (and most importantly), there is nothing wrong with people holding religious beliefs! People are free to believe as they choose. Several studies and talks discuss the importance of religion in people&#8217;s lives even if it would be shown to be false! The issue is not whether people should believe in God or hold religious beliefs. The issue is whether those beliefs should play a prominent role in a melting-pot society. There are excellent arguments to be made on both sides of that issue. Ridicule is not an argument.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am disappointed by this development. Hopefully, atheists and believers can come together to create the best possible society for everyone; a world free of mockery and ridicule.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/divorce.gif"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5243" title="divorce" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/divorce.gif?resize=269%2C269" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A lot of people seem to agree that the chasidic system (maybe even the charedi system as well) of marriage and dating needs some updating. There is also a consensus that using religion as a weapon to keep people in the fold is wrong. Most people also think that mothers should have custody of their children even if they are not religious and the father is religious.</p>
<p>Is there any hope that the charedi and chasidic worlds can adapt and adjust to fix these problems?</p>
<p>From what I am hearing, the answer is yes. Several commenters on the blog and Facebook have shared encouraging developments. It seems they are open to new ideas. In this spirit, allow me to make a few suggestions. Keep in mind, these are suggestions for insular communities. I prefer non-insular communities in general. But in the meantime, here is some advice that can be implemented within the insular communities.<span id="more-5242"></span></p>
<p>First, some definitions:</p>
<p>Chasidic community: A<em>n insular community where the entire community is expected to conform to one way of religious life.</em></p>
<p>Chasidic dating: <em>Parents arrange meeting between two 17-18 year olds. They meet for 30 minutes. They decline or agree to see each other again. The second date seals the deal.</em></p>
<p>Charedi community: A<em> non-chasidic community that tries to reduce engagement with the outside world and prefers a lifestyle of exclusive Torah study over a career.</em></p>
<p>Charedi dating: <em>Parents arrange a meeting between a preferably 18-19 year old girl and a 22-23 year old boy. They meet for 3-4 hours between 4-8 times. They get engaged and see each other a few times before the wedding 2 months later.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dating</strong></p>
<p>No one under the age of 19 should be considered for a shidduch. They are off limits. Couples should date for no fewer than 1 month and see each other a minimum of 10 times before getting engaged. Dates should be fun, encourage conversation, the conversations should include things like how excited one is about religion and if there are things that they question.</p>
<p>Engagements should last 3 months. The couple should see each other no less than once every two weeks. When they see one another they should have fun and enjoy each other&#8217;s company. They should have at least a preliminary conversation about intimacy before the wedding night. The teachers who will explain to them how &#8220;things work&#8221; should be extremely highly qualified and be as liberal as the community allows.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>Couples should be advised on matters of family planning. This is not the place to go to far into detail. But if the children of the couple will be a burden on the community, they might need to ask a shyla before having children, not vice versa. Further, when a couple has children too quickly, it can stunt the development of their relationship which is barely in its infancy after a contracted dating period and quick marriage.</p>
<p><strong>When Things Go Wrong</strong></p>
<p>During a marriage, one spouse may prefer a more or less religious lifestyle. This should not be immediate grounds for divorce. The goal should be happiness for the couple and keeping the family together. Men should not be defined by the way their wives act and women should not be defined by the way their husbands act. Religious compatibility does not need to be the deciding factor in marriage. I know couples who are very happy and they each observe to different degrees. This should be acceptable.</p>
<p>If the couple is incompatible religiously and incompatible in general a divorce should be sought. The get should not be withheld at all. The couple should strive for a custody agreement that is mutually agreeable. If they cannot agree, the secular courts should decide it. A Beis Din is not the place to decide custody matters when one parent is more religious than the other. It is inherently unfair. The couple better try their best to agree because the courts may decide to create a system that neither party likes.</p>
<p>These are some of my thoughts and ideas. I don&#8217;t imagine that they will solve all the problems. Nor do I imagine that any system is perfect. But I do believe that not tweaking the system will cause it to collapse. Albert Einstein said: <em>&#8220;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We want different results. We want better results. Perhaps these suggestions can help just a bit.</p>
<p>I am open to any ideas you have. Remember we are trying to maintain the basic standards of the chasidic and charedi communities. Major overhauls are a non-starter.</p>

The common understanding of atheism is a rejection of the existence of a deity.</p>
<p>This definition used to bother me. How is it possible for one to be certain that there is no deity. Even if one is positive that a deity is impossible to perceive, it is certainly possible that the deity chose to remain hidden. In short, I always thought that an atheist who asserted unequivocally that there absolutely no God was a fool. It is literally impossible to be certain that a deity does not exist.</p>
<p>Dawkins was asked if he was 100% certain in his atheist beliefs. His reply? No. He half-jokingly added that he was 6.9 of 7 certain of atheism as the correct belief. Dawkins clarified his position that the &#8220;probability of a supernatural creator existing is very, very, low.&#8221;</p>
<p>So is Richard Dawkins still considered an atheist?<span id="more-5198"></span></p>
<p>I think so. While it is true that the common understanding of atheism is a rejection of the existence of a deity and Dawkins does not &#8220;reject&#8221; it, rather he is extremely skeptical, this is not really the definition of atheism. The real definition is the belief that one should not accept anything dogmatic based on faith. The atheist reject God, not because God doesn&#8217;t exist, rather because it is impossible to prove God exists and it is not necessary, in the view of the atheist, to add belief in God in order to successfully navigate through life.</p>
<p>Dawkins rejects belief in God because it is so improbable, in his opinion, and by definition impossible to prove. That is atheism.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also honesty.</p>
<p>I am sure there are people who are certain the God does not exist. I question how those people can be certain of something that is so inappropriate for certainty. But it was nice to see that Dawkins is not one of those fools. He is just someone who lives his life based on what can be proved and demonstrated via testing. Religions cannot be proved. They can be made into reasonable or rational beliefs, but they cannot be proved to the degree that an atheist like Dawkins demands for his personal decisions. If he is being honest, we should be honest as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/6a00d8341c7de353ef0167621b37c0970b-600wi.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5159" title="6a00d8341c7de353ef0167621b37c0970b-600wi" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/6a00d8341c7de353ef0167621b37c0970b-600wi-300x216.jpg?resize=300%2C216" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Let&#8217;s assume for sake of this post that Obamacare is constitutional on its face. That is, there is no problem requiring all citizens to have insurance. I don&#8217;t think this is necessarily the case, but this issue will be decided in the courts over the next year or so. The more interesting question for people of religion is whether the requirement that employers insure their employees and provide all women with free access to birth control pills is a violation of the first amendment or more provocatively, if is an &#8220;attack against religion&#8221;.</p>
<p>To start, some math. The government is an insurer. With or without Obamacare. This is because the government provides public health care for many people. The poor, the elderly, and others all get their health care paid for by the government. Insurance costs have risen higher than the inflation rate. One proposed reason for this is because uninsured people weigh down the system. At this point there are three choices. One choice is to continue on this path and provide care to the uninsured without a plan to pay for it. The second choice is to cut off the uninsured and deny them care unless they pay up front. The third choice is to create a comprehensive plan to lower the cost and insure everybody. Obama has chosen choice number three as have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care" target="_blank">many other countries across the world</a>.</p>
<p>Choice three requires that costs be lowered. One useful tool in keeping health care costs down is to provide free birth control. This is a mathematical fact. It sounds crude and unkind. But it is true. Unwanted pregnancies are bound to happen in a free society and even if we all agree that it is amoral to engage in activities that can create an unwanted pregnancy that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that they still occur. Providing birth control to everyone helps alleviate this burden.</p>
<p>That is the math. It is not a decision by secularists to force people to stop having religious babies. It is an economic decision.</p>
<p>That being said, we need to analyze whether an unintended result of this policy is offensive or even an attack against religious people.</p>
<p><span id="more-5158"></span></p>
<p>The Pope declared that <em>using</em> birth control is proscribed by God. In Catholicism, the Pope has this authority. Under the current rules, Catholics do not need to use birth control. They don&#8217;t have to pick it up at the pharmacy. They can pretend it doesn&#8217;t exist for all anyone care. Although, according to the statistics 98% of Catholic women have used birth control and 78% believe one can be a good Catholic and use birth control.</p>
<p>The next issue is whether a Catholic person or institution can be required to pay for birth control on behalf of others. This is where it gets sticky. Technically speaking, Catholics, like most other religions believe that everyone has to listen to their laws, not just Catholics. Their view, like most religions, is that salvation or nirvana or perfection comes through their laws and lifestyle. Therefore, paying for others to use birth control sort of delays this process. It impedes their progress towards a world of perfection, ie Catholics. Thus, in this manner of speaking, the requirement that employers provide and pay for insurance that covers birth control is a type of violation of the religious beliefs of Catholics.</p>
<p>The problem with this view is that it enters extremely dangerous territory. It is impossible for the government to accommodate all religious views and hopes for world domination. Without getting into specifics, every religion has beliefs that concern some Utopian period where their laws are supreme. It is impossible to reconcile all these laws with government policy.</p>
<p>Religions have and will continue to focus on their adherents and instruct them to follow the laws of their particular religion. But religions must keep their Utopian beliefs between each other and cannot expect the world to cow to beliefs that impose on others or that dictate how others, outside their religion should act. Finally, the government is not to be used as a tool to manipulate the citizens of the country into neatly adhering to a particular religious beliefs. The government should not play any role in assisting religions achieving their goals of religious superiority.</p>
<p>The argument over birth control has become politicized. It is no longer about religious freedom, rather it has become an exercise in controlling birth control.</p>
<p>Finally, I find it odd that orthodox Jewish groups have aligned themselves with those who are against the birth control provision. I already wrote about that on DovBear a couple months ago: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/12/ou-and-agudah-unite-against.html" target="_blank">OU and Agudah Unite Against Contraceptives</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/superstition.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5148" title="superstition" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/superstition-300x214.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A light hearted article in Tablet Magazine caught my eye today. The writer, Allison Hoffman, is a reform Jew who is in the midst of a pregnancy.</p>
<p>As a reform Jew, Ms. Hoffman takes pride in her enlightened, rational, science and fact based beliefs. She is not superstitious, nor does she use halacha as a guide for living her life. Like many reform Jews, she may equate the two as one and the same.</p>
<p>The problem for Ms. Hoffman is that during her pregnancy she has developed some nasty superstitions. Like many women who are carrying a fetus inside their body, Ms. Hoffman has developed a need to protect her baby at all costs. And this includes tapping into tried and true superstitions like not calling the baby by name until the baby is born and formally named.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all seen this happen. Perfectly rational people become irrational at certain times. Ms. Hoffman talks about her experience as a pregnant mom. Death does the same thing to other rationalists. Illness does it to others. Ironically enough, this phenomena has a scientific explanation too. When there is a uncertainty and doubt, the mind seeks to establish some control over the situation. Thus superstitions emerge.<span id="more-5147"></span></p>
<p>Ms. Hoffman is disappointed that there are so few superstitions in reform Judaism. The whole thing is rather entertaining. As a side note, it is interesting to see people defend superstitions that were borrowed from pagans or non-Jews as &#8220;real&#8221; or kabbalistic.</p>
<p>Pregnancy is one of life&#8217;s greatest mysteries. So much that is happening is unobservable and the stakes are so high that we want to somehow influence the result. We do what we cant, but we wish we could do more. We start to develop superstitions.</p>
<p>Death is no different. What happens after we die? What happens to the soul? What does it feel like? All these questions cannot be answered by observable fact. Science does not address these questions, other that to say &#8220;nothing&#8221;. Rational people become less rational around death. People who don&#8217;t believe in God or care about Mitzvah observance will come to shul and say Kaddish. I&#8217;m not saying that Kaddish is superstition. I am saying that it is out of character for a rational, non-believer to say a prayer for someone who died.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean?</p>
<p>It means that when things require an explanation but there is no explanation coming, human nature is to turn to a deity. This is what we call The God of Gaps. This belief system asserts that since not everything can be explained the only explanation that remains is God. In other words, God is to be found in the mysteries of life. Superstition and religion are siblings in this model. Closely related. Religion is legitimate beliefs that cover things that we can&#8217;t explain. Superstition are illegitimate beliefs that accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p>The problem with this belief system is that there is a line of progress that is shrinking the gaps. Drastically. What we know today is far more than we knew 20 years ago. Compared with medieval scholars we are all super-scholars. To borrow a phrase: If they are humans we are like angels. If we are humans they are like donkeys. Compared with the ancients we might even know more than they thought God knew! If one of us would travel back to the time of the ancients I am certain that person would be considered a God. This system encourages people to cast skepticism towards science. It causes people to doubt things that can be proved. It does not increase critical thinking. In short, it makes people less sophisticated, not more sophisticated.</p>
<p>The gaps are shrinking. Is God shrinking too?</p>
<p>It does not have to be this way. Maimonides wrote that God is seen in observable phenomena. The <em>more</em> we know about our physical world, the <em>more</em> we can appreciate the greatness of God. This is the opposite of the God of the Gaps. It is the God of Everything. Superstition and religion have nothing to do with each other. One is an attempt to explain things that we can&#8217;t understand. The other is an attribution of everything &#8211; things that we do understand and things that we don&#8217;t understand. In this view, there is no need to add superstitions or be sketical of science. As we discover more and learn new things, we can appreciate and even come to love God more and more. <em>(And don&#8217;t worry, science will never be able to prove that God doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s impossible.)</em> This system encourages progress because more knowledge is not be feared as an antidote to God. This benefits everyone.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day we will know even more about pregnancy and superstitions will become superfluous. We don&#8217;t need the mystery of pregnancy to find and see God. Marvel in its complexity and the &#8220;miracle&#8221; of child-birth. It&#8217;s not what we don&#8217;t know. It is what we do know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion-and-politics2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5104" title="religion-and-politics2" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion-and-politics2.jpeg?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Politicians from the Right often cite God or Jesus as a basis for political positions. Some even make the claim that they are running for office upon the advise of God Himself.</p>
<p>Now, it is impossible for God to have told more than one particular person that they are destined to be the next president. So either all but one are lying or they are all lying. You decide.</p>
<p>Either way, the whole concept of appealing to God&#8217;s authority in politics is very silly. The reason it is silly is because none of these people have had any specific revelation. Rather, they apply their interpretations of ancient texts, or worse, their personal feelings or emotional stirrings and claim that these are Divine messages. What makes matters even fuzzier is that politicians are usually businessmen or lawyers. They are not theologians or members of the clergy. Their understanding of their own religions is as basic as the average American&#8217;s understanding of their religions. Their understanding of other religions is even poorer.</p>
<p>Case in point: President Obama invoked the teachings of Jesus as a basis for taxes. The response has been vicious. Most of the criticism has been because of the seeming transparent pandering to the religious voters. This is a valid criticism. But only to a point. Politicians are professional panderers. We just don&#8217;t like it when <em>we can tell</em>.</p>
<p>The more important point, that is being overlooked, is how religious beliefs are able to conform to political positions. <span id="more-5102"></span>It&#8217;s too easy to make an argument for almost any predetermined position using religious faith or texts. The stories are obscure, the analogies are tenuous and the bias is overwhelming. It&#8217;s to the point that I can&#8217;t take any appeal to religion seriously. Further, not everyone <em>wants </em>to follow the teachings of Jesus. Those same teachings were used as a tool for death and destruction for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Are taxes some form of charity, as Obama suggests? Maybe. But religion is not going to provide the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Political policy should be based on reasoning that is free from religious influence. It should not be guided by love for God or religion nor should it be guided by disbelief in God or hatred for religion.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t blame politicians. I blame the religious fervor of American citizens that demands that their politicians double as religious leaders. It&#8217;s foolish to assume that politicians know enough about religion to have intelligent opinions on theological matters. We should stop demanding it. Along the same lines, we should not turn to one specific version of a religion to solve our problems or as a basis for setting policy. At best, it is silly and at worse it is offensive.</p>
<p>I think the other speaker at the event at which the president spoke had good advice. Eric Metaxas suggested we remove phony religiosity from public discourse. Since it is all phony, I say we remove it all.</p>

I saw it just after I wrote about the modern day exorcist here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/28/demons-dybbuks-devils-and-exorcism/" target="_blank">Demons, Dybbuks, Devils and Exorcism</a>. Buying this book was a smart decision. I read the book a little while back and neglected to do a review but I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you all about this book since I read it.</p>
<p>The author, J.H Chajes, is a professor at University of Haifa. He is a distant relative of the great Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> is very scholarly and well researched. Yet, it reads like a novel, well almost like a novel, and it kept me engrossed in its content from start to finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> chronicles the rise of recorded incidents of dybbuks and exorcism in the era of mystical writings of the Arizal&#8217;s students. Most of the book takes place in the 16th and 17th centuries. The book traces the relationship between Christian, Muslim and Jewish exorcism legends and practice as well. An appendix has full accounts of exorcisms found in rabbinic literature from that era.</p>
<p>As a skeptic, I found the restraint of Chajes astounding. It is almost as if he is winking the entire time that he is writing about demonic / disembodied soul possession. You just know that he can&#8217;t believe what he is writing as fact is even possible. But he writes as an objective 3rd party about rabbis and others performing exorcisms with a straight face.</p>
<p>There are a few points that I took away from the book that are worth sharing.<span id="more-4968"></span> First of all, the book mentions some disputes between rabbis. They were vicious disagreements. Accusations of philandering, abject immorality and horrible insults are hurled the way of one particular rabbi. I can only imagine what our rabbinic disputes will look like to historians some time in the future. Fascinating to read and fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>Second, the book supports the theory that &#8220;the more knowledge becomes accessible, the more some religious leaders will try to &#8216;esotericize&#8217; their religion to maintain a level of separation between the masses and the public&#8221;. I know, that theory is a mouthful. With regard to exorcism it works as follows. The masses were becoming more literate throughout the world. Exorcism was an art reserved for spiritual leaders and scholars. It was not available to the masses no matter how learned they became. Thus, the existence of demons and dybbuks reinforced the need for leadership. It is similar to today&#8217;s maximalist position of Daas Torah. In a time that more orthodox Jews can study the sources and responsa on a given subject, the religious leaders have reserved a segment of inaccessible knowledge under the maximalist position of Daas Torah. I&#8217;m not saying this is wrong or intentional, rather it is a pattern and it happens.</p>
<p>My third point for this review is the nature of the relationship between Jewish scholars and their Christian and Muslim counterparts. It seems that there was much interaction between them and they worked together, at least for the sake of exorcism. It was nice to see cooperation instead of the stereotypical debates and polemics against one another. If they could do it, so could we.</p>
<p>If you have ANY interest in dybbuks or demons or exorcism or 16th century mysticism, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a>.</p>

That time of year when everyone is supposed to be preparing for their respective holidays full of good cheer and spirits. What ends up happening is people tripping over themselves to be insulted or to make statements about their beliefs.</p>
<p>First, a bit of history. It might be that a lot of the grumbling comes from not understanding what this time of year really means for various people of various religions and faiths.</p>
<p>People have been celebrating holidays around the winter solstice for eons.</p>
<p>The Talmud makes the claim that Adam initiated the first winter solstice celebration. Having been created in the fall (Tishrei) and having sinned almost immediately upon his creation, Adam believed that he was being punished with less and less daylight. The day after the solstice he realized that such was the way of the world and the daylight period would be getting longer and longer. The next year he celebrated the 8 days preceding the solstice and the 8 days following the solstice as holidays. (BT Avodah Zara 8a). The Mishna which is being discussed in that Talmudic statement notes that there were several pagan holidays that were celebrated around the winter solstice during the Mishnaic era (circa 70-200 CE).</p>
<p>Clearly, there are very old sources that all orthodox Jews deem reliable indicating that this time of year was marked by celebrations. These celebrations predate Christmas and in the instance of Adam, predate Chanukah as well. Further, if the pagan celebrations noted in the Mishna were a few centuries old at the time, those holidays predate Chanukah as well. This is all according traditional, ancient Jewish sources.<span id="more-4941"></span></p>
<p>Although Christmas celebrates the birth of the Christian religion, it was not celebrated widely for the first 1000 years of Christianity. Slowly, through the middle ages the holiday gained prominence. About 300 years ago the holiday was already very popular with many Christians but some of the factions breaking off from mainstream Christianity at the time deemed it a pagan holiday and banned its celebration. The Puritans, famous for their establishing of colonies on American soil fined anyone who dared celebrate this holiday. The holiday is not found in scripture so it was presumed by them to have been borrowed from pagans and was impure.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 19th century Christmas became a universally accepted Christian holiday. The Christmas Tree was incorporated into the celebration as well. Later, in the 20th century, the imagery of Santa Claus, his elves, toy soldiers, gingerbread cookies and other familiar Christmas symbols made their way into the lore.</p>
<p>The holiday surged in popularity and then in the 21st century, non-Christians began to feel barraged by the overt religious overtones of the celebrations taking place on &#8220;neutral ground&#8221;. The ACLU, atheist groups and others began asking, sometimes demanding, that Christmas not be celebrated in public places.</p>
<p>Many Christmas celebrators took offense to this. Plenty of arguments have been invoked trying to establish a reason that Christmas celebrations should be allowed in public schools, municipal parks, government facilities, retail stores and pretty much anywhere and everywhere else. Jon Stewart and Bill O&#8217;Reilly have been going on about this for years and Rick Perry spurned an Internet meme with his opinion.</p>
<p>Rabbi Adlerstein on Patheos and the LA Times have reported on the Santa Monica war over Christmas. For years, an elaborate Nativity scene decked the halls of a Santa Monica park. There are 21 spots for holiday displays. A number of groups entered a lottery to determine who would get the spots. Atheist groups won 14 of the spots, Jewish groups got three and the rest went to the Nativity.</p>
<p>The atheists are being pretty mean spirited about the whole thing. They are using this as a platform to poke fun and mock religious people. That&#8217;s not very nice. But I wonder how they would have responded if the displays had not been religious, i.e. The Nativity, and instead were the cultural symbols of Santa, peppermint candy and reindeer. Many of the Christmas displays are not signs of religion per se, rather a new-age version of a Christian holiday with winter symbolism that is not inherently religious.</p>
<p>Although, I don&#8217;t agree with Rabbi Adlerstein and many other religious Jews as well as Christians who want more Christmas displays. Last week I was at Disneyland with my family. The daily parade was holiday themed. Our younger son really, really wanted to see many of his favorite Disney characters who were not out and about during the day. We figured we would see them during the parade so even though we were not interested in the Christmasness of the parade we stayed to watch. He was thrilled and in that respect it was the right choice.</p>
<p>I watched the parade carefully. There was not one ounce of religion in the parade. Nothing that was particularly Christian or related to Jesus. There were reindeer, there were red hats, Santa and the Mrs. paraded on by, scenes from the Nutcracker, and other holiday stories were represented and there was a tree. But literally nothing in the parade was religious. Yet, we were all very uncomfortable. The symbols of Christmas have become part and parcel of the religious holiday despite not really being intrinsically related to the religious holiday. In other words, even though the parade was not religious, it offended our Jewish sensitivities. This was not our holiday. We were guests. It was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Disney can do as it sees fit. But as a consumer I was disappointed. What is usually a highlight of the day was uncomfortable for everyone over the age of 3 because they chose to integrate a Christian holiday into a celebration of fun, magic and fantasy. It is unfortunate. And I can completely relate to the atheists who are offended by similar displays of holiday spirit and cheer even when stripped of their specifically religious elements.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t justify their over the top protest. Not at all. But I do believe that public religious and symbolic displays that are Christmas and Christian-centric are not inclusive and do not need to be tolerated anywhere and everywhere by the non-Christian public.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tim-tebow-tebowing.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4870" title="tim-tebow-tebowing" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tim-tebow-tebowing.jpg?resize=250%2C250" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>There is nothing quite like Tim Tebow.</p>
<p>He is one of the most decorated NCAA Football players of all time. He worked for years as a Missionary spreading the Gospel in Southeast Asia. He is arguably the worst passing quarterback in the NFL. He is by far the most talked about sports personality.</p>
<p>Quite a combination. Much of the talk of Tim Tebow relates to his very obvious religious beliefs. I say they are obvious because Tebow kneels in prayer during the game. He points to the sky all the time. He invokes the name of his God every time he has a chance to do so. Tebow&#8217;s antics inspired an entire internet meme called <a href="http://tebowing.com/" target="_blank">#Tebowing</a>. People would kneel as if in prayer at the most awkward times and places and snap a picture. This is aside from the very clever <a href="http://occupytebow.com/" target="_blank">#occupytebow</a> movement which is not relevant to this blog post.</p>
<p>The point is that Tebow takes his religion very seriously. Whenever athletes thank God and praise God for their accomplishments it can be irksome to everyone. Religious people of the same religion, religious people of other religions and atheists can all find ways to be offended.</p>
<p>Does God really want the Home team to beat the Away team? Does God really give special powers to some teams and not to other teams? Does a player&#8217;s religious conviction really have an impact on a game?<span id="more-4868"></span></p>
<p>I think the answer to all those questions is no. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/30/whose-fault-is-a-dropped-game-wininng-touchdown/">Whose Fault is a Dropped Game-Wininng Touchdown?</a> for my feelings on this one.</p>
<p>In fact, please read that post because you&#8217;ll see that I actually agree with Tim Tebow on this issue.</p>
<p>Tebow was asked about invoking God as part of his athletic accomplishments and he didn&#8217;t take the bait. He answered that he doesn&#8217;t give God the credit or the blame. He is merely using his platform as a way of teaching people about his religion. He emphatically denied that his religion gives him an edge or that he can play better because of God. He focused on the opportunity to use his fame and success to glorify the name of his God.</p>
<p>He also mentions that football does not define him. He is defined by his morality and good acts. He is defined by his character. So his religion is not a cause. It is merely a basis for his life. It is not part of his game on the field.</p>
<p>I think that is a great answer. Great job by Tebow.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me is that Tebow invokes the name of his God, Jesus, and that is somewhat acceptable within society. Imagine a Muslim player praising Allah or a Jewish person praising God (not Jesus). I don&#8217;t think they would be as accepted.</p>
<p>Christian displays of religious fervor are far more tolerated than that of any other religion. It can make the rest of us feel uncomfortable. Tebow is doing it in a way that minimizes the discomfort for others but even his way has rankled many people. It would be wise for people to limit religion to religious activities and not pepper it throughout their public lives.</p>
<p>Watch Tebow&#8217;s interview. The religious stuff is near the end:</p>

See bottom of the post.</strong></em></p>
<p>Last week, forty seven states in the union had anti-bullying statutes. This makes it easier for schools to fight bullying. It also gives potential bullies reason for pause and hopefully can stave off some of the bullying that is going on in schools across America.</p>
<p>Bullying can have a very negative affect on the victims and several suicide deaths have been attributed to the lingering trauma of being bullied in school.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest targets of bullying are young people who do not conform to specific teenage archetypes.</p>
<p>For a little while I was working for <a href="jsu.org">JSU</a> (a wonderful organization) and went to Public Schools every day during lunch and mentored Jewish clubs. I had to walk through the common areas where hundreds of teens were hanging out and enjoying their lunch. It was uncanny. Little groups formed all around the school. In each group, very specific types of kids were enjoying time together. Goth kids in one area, jocks in their jerseys in another with cheerleaders in their uniforms nearby, Asian kids texting in one corner, minority groups, African American and Latino teens in their respective areas. It was jarring to see such a diverse school divide itself during free time into small social groups of mutual self-identifiction.</p>
<p>I used to say it felt like the set of Mean Girls. Maybe now I would say it felt like the set of Glee.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how a social misfit could feel absolutely isolated in school. Add to that the humiliation and abuse of bullying the burden can become too much to bear.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, teens who don&#8217;t fit in with typical gender roles are particularly maligned. If a guy is too feminine or a girl is too masculine their suffering at the hand of cruel classmates can be compounded. It gets even worse if the victim already feels guilt from their parents, religion or negative self perception.</p>
<p>Michigan is one of the last holdouts and does not have an anti-bullying statute. But now it has something else. It has a statute that actually protects certain types of bullies.<span id="more-4787"></span></p>
<p>A bill was proposed a while back to create strong anti-bullying legislation. It passed this week. But one provision was added at the last moment that completely turns the law on its head. The provision states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;This section does not abridge the rights under the First Amendment of the constitution of the United States or under article I of the state constitution of 1963 of a school employee, school volunteer, pupil, or a pupil&#8217;s parent or guardian. This section does not prohibit a statement of a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction of a school employee, school volunteer, pupil, or a pupil&#8217;s parent or guardian.&#8221;&#8216;</em></p>
<p><em></em>So if my &#8220;sincerely held religious belief&#8221; says all Jews are subhuman and I call all Jewish kids in the school names and taunt them about their subhuman status, that&#8217;s &#8220;protected&#8221; by the bill. If me religious beliefs says all Christians are infidels, then I can bully all the infidels. If my religion says that gay people are causing earthquakes and tsunamis then I can bully all the gay kids.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some bullies who don&#8217;t invoke the name of God into their bully tactics. But that&#8217;s all changed now. If you want to bully somebody and avoid punishment just make sure you can justify it in the name of religion.</p>
<p>This is horrible. Not just because of what it does for bullies and does to victims. But because of what it does to religion.</p>
<p>Once again, religion is being used as an excuse for destructive and harmful behavior. Once again religion becomes a shield for bad behavior. This is what give religion a bad rap. People using religion to kill infidels, avenge the death of a god, hate people who are different, demonize the other. That is everything that is wrong with religion.</p>
<p>If your religion says that somebody is wrong or bad, keep it to yourself. Don&#8217;t use your beliefs as a way of harming others. If you want to live in a place that only allows your kind of religion and permits religious persecution to others LEAVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA <em>(please)</em> and find a place that will let you do it. That&#8217;s what they should have said. Instead, they turned Michigan into a safe haven for hate, bigotry and pain. It&#8217;s a disgrace.</p>
<p>This is not what religion is supposed to be. But thanks to the Michigan State Senate we are told that religion is precisely just that. A weapon in the hands of hateful people.</p>
<p>There is also an irony here. The bill is named for a victim of bullying, Matt Epling, who committed suicide. His family has been involved in the crafting of this legislation to help protect kids from bullies. But now they are forever attached by name to a bill they never would have supported thanks to some <em>bullies</em> in the State Senate. First Matt was bullied by his peers and now his parents are being bullied by the legislature.</p>
<p>I hate this law because of what it does for bullies but I also hate the law for what it says about the current state of religion in this country.</p>
<p>Watch State Senator Gretchen Whitmer passionately respond to the bill:</p>

<p>I have NOT read the book. I have read the interview.</p>
<p>The book is a study of how and why religions became part of the human experience from the perspective of social evolution. The premise is that humans need religion and this spawned religion.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not a perspective that most religious people are going to be comfortable sharing. For religious people, religion came directly from God. Not because of a human need to create religion.</p>
<p>Although, reading the interview made me think about how religions view other contemporary religions to their own and religions that preceded their own. For example, what does Judaism / Christianity / Islam / Buddhism / Hinduism / Native American religions etc. say about how the &#8220;others&#8221; practice. If each religion claims it was revealed by God then what are all those other people doing? Did God give them other instructions? Or did <em>they</em> invent their religions while <em>yours</em> is correct? Where did those religions come from if God only revealed your religion?</p>
<p>Very interesting questions.<span id="more-4524"></span></p>
<p>As for Judaism, Maimonides has a comprehensive approach to explain the existence of religions prior to Abraham and how one served God before the revelation of the Torah.</p>
<p>Briefly, God revealed to Adam some basic commandments but of primary importance was to recognize the existence of a Singular, All Powerful Creator. A few individuals were able to maintain this level of observance. But most people corrupted it and began to focus their attention to things that they viewed as &#8220;powers&#8221; such as the sun, moon, wind etc. Instead of worshipping the Creator they worshipped these &#8220;powers&#8221;. Eventually this gave way to full blown pagan religions.</p>
<p>The only monotheistic religion was the small group of people who followed Adam&#8217;s teachings. Abraham was chosen as the man from whom would grow a people who would teach this system. Eventually this became the Jewish people who got a much more complete set of instructions at Sinai.</p>
<p>Christianity and Islam are clear and direct branches off the Judaism tree.</p>
<p>We are forced to say that other religions either evolved from the original pagans who did not accept the monotheism of Adam / Abraham or that they borrowed ideas from existing Adam / Abraham monotheism. As for their claims that God revealed their religion to them through a prophet and the instructions differ from ours, there are two points. First, there is certainly room for prophecy among non-Jews but it is unlikely that a pagan would be a prophet considering the qualifications. Further, if the prophet contradicted the Torah or the Abrahamic version of monotheism we would be forced to say the prophet is a fraud.</p>
<p>Being part of a global community of religions sometimes means that we need to admit that our traditions are mutually exclusive. I think it is important and worthwhile to analyze how we deal with questions about how other religions were formed. Each religion believes it is the right one. But they cannot ignore the fact that others exist.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the presence of such questions and analyzing their answers does not prove or disprove the validity of religion in general or a specific religion in question.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Someone is wrong of the Internet" src="http://i2.wp.com/imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png?resize=300%2C330" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Best. Cartoon. Ever. ©xkcd</p></div>
<p>The blogosphere is really one giant argument. Opinions are expressed, supported, rebutted, debated, refined and discarded on a daily basis. One has to wonder if anyone ever wins. Is anyone ever swayed by an argument on a blog or even in person? Will anyone change their mind based on an argument? How and when do we change our minds?</p>
<p>These questions are impossible for me to answer. But I have feelings about each of these questions. I have had so many arguments in real life and on the Internet about so many different things. Ranging from sports, to politics, to religion, to culture and everything in between.</p>
<p>Of course my opinions have changed over time. But how did it happen? Did I lose an argument and my mind was changed? It&#8217;s impossible to know how it works and when the switch gets turned. But learning is a process and people can change their minds. It just feels like they never do.</p>
<p>Of course, I have also spent significant time arguing over and reading arguments in the Talmud and its commentaries.<span id="more-4361"></span> The Talmud is basically one giant argument. There are many opinions about many things and their validity is questioned and challenged with logical reasoning, textual support and moral arguments. The many commentaries on the Talmud argue about how to codify the law, explain various passages and answer contradictions in logic and thought. Very frequently arguments are won or conceded.</p>
<p>The assumption in all arguments and especially in the arguments in the Talmud is that there is a search for truth that is behind the arguments. Each side believes that they have the truth and when the truth becomes apparent the loser will concede that their opinion is incorrect and change their mind. As mentioned before, this doesn&#8217;t seem to happen in real life. Although in the Talmud it happens on just about every page. To be fair, the ones doing the conceding are rarely the owners of the opinion, rather it is the proponents of that opinion. We are left to wonder what the author of the losing opinion would have held had he been presented with the winning arguments.</p>
<p>A recent NY Times article mentions a study that attempts to redefine argument. According to the study we do not argue or use reason to find the truth. Rather we argue with logic and reason, sometimes very flawed, to win the argument and support a previously held position. This is something like confirmation bias. Our opinion is not formed by reason, our powers of reason are used to support an opinion that we want to hold.</p>
<p>This is significant because it really means the real reason that we argue is not with the expectation that we will change anyone&#8217;s mind. Rather it is so that we can convince ourselves of our opinion and win the argument. In other words, winning is more important that being right. In fact this is exactly how the law works in the secular court system. We don&#8217;t care who is right, we care who presents a better case. We don&#8217;t care if the defendant committed the crime, we care whether it can proved that he committed the crime.</p>
<p><em>(If you read the article you will see that the article uses the law as an example of deciding who is right. I don&#8217;t believe the author of the article characterizes the law correctly.)</em></p>
<p>So, in the Talmud the object is certainly to find some sort of truth. I don&#8217;t believe the article would apply to the Talmud as the objective there is clear and established. But I am willing to consider that arguing has evolved into a competition of who wins and who loses as opposed to who is right and who is wrong.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that arguing cannot lead to the truth. It just means that is why arguing evolved and it is part of every single argument that ever existed and will ever exist. Arguing to win can lead to truth. It&#8217;s just not the explanation for why we argue and why we choose certain logic and fallacies to support our position.</p>
<p>That also doesn&#8217;t mean arguing isn&#8217;t important or valuable. On the contrary, I also believe that the winning arguments that are best supported by their arguers will over time represent some kind of truth. Sometimes the truth is empirical, but most of the time, the truth is that there is a bias that must be confirmed. Admitted that or acknowledging that can be the case is important. Especially in the areas of religion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scales-of-justice-legal-aid-toronto-gta-canada.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4235" title="scales-of-justice" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scales-of-justice-legal-aid-toronto-gta-canada.jpg?resize=245%2C299" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>One of the confusing things about the Bible is the different names attributed to God. To Bible critics this is an indication that more than one God or more than one version of God or simply more than one author is present in the Bible.</p>
<p>Talmudic Judaism has a different approach. God, the One God, has more than one name (see yesterday&#8217;s Rambam class: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/15/rambam-class-51511/">Rambam Class 5/15/11</a>). Since God is infinite and cannot be limited to one &#8220;mood&#8221; or &#8220;characteristic&#8221; therefore different names are used when God is Acting in a specific way. That specific way cannot define God because it would limit God. Instead, the Torah uses different names to identify the character of God in that Act, commandment, prophecy. The Ineffable name of God, יהוה, refers to God&#8217;s mercy. The other commonly found name in the Bible is אלוהים. This name refers to God&#8217;s precise Judgment.</p>
<p>The two Names play off each other. Without mercy, the judgment would be too harsh and without the judgment, the mercy would be too forgiving. There is a balance. A Perfect balance.</p>
<p>God is both our Father and our King. God loves us and we are expected to love God back. God also metes out punishment and we are expected to fear God.</p>
<p>This is all very nice, but why talk it about it today?<span id="more-4232"></span></p>
<p>Because of  a (fairly) recent article in LA Times.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago the LA Times reported on a study that determined the willingness of diffferent kinds of people to cheat on a test. Three very interesting things arose from the peer reviewed and published study.</p>
<p>First, that there is no difference between the ethical behavior of atheists and believers. This is surprising to believers because there is a lot of rhetoric directed against non-believers. The rhetoric often claims that non-believers prefer not to believe to give them license to act immorally. After all, if there is no God, why act morally? This study debunks that assumption. There is a better, more precise argument about the difference between the morality of atheists and believers. That is, the believer&#8217;s source of morality is a Creator. The Creator can better establish the baseline of morality than humans. An atheist&#8217;s version of morality is subject to the ideas of flawed people. (Of course the counter argument is that the word of God is subject to interpretation. To which the counter to that counter is that the interpretations of a specific religious sect are claimed to be Divine as well. And so on and so one&#8230;)</p>
<p>The second was that 95% of americans believe in God. Which does skew the perception that God is losing and falling out of the collective american soul. But those 95% have many very different views of God. Some believe God is very involved in the daily lives of humans and others believe God created the world and took a vacation. Others believe that God will render judgment in the afterlife and others do not. The point is that while 95% agree God exists, who that God is, is still very much in debate. But also, I believe the significantly smaller sample size of atheists does affect the results of the this study in some way. I am just not certain how.</p>
<p>The third, even more interesting part of the study demonstrated that there is a difference in the ethical decisions of believers in a punitive God and belief in a compassionate God. Turns out that believers in a punitive God were less likely to cheat than believers in a compassionate God. At first glance, this is not surprising. But it is discouraging. It seems to me that the believers in a compassionate God are able to excuse unethical behavior on account of the belief that God will forgive their sins. Even if God does forgive their sins, isn&#8217;t it important to be honest and moral anyway? I believe it is.</p>
<p>Talmudic Judaism accounts for both of these versions of God. We believe that God is compassionate and God is perfectly just. There exists a balance and perhaps this would serve as a correction for those who focus on the compassion of God. This balance is important and upsetting the balance appaers to threaten to affect the morality of believers.</p>
<p>To me, this study affirms the wisdom of the Torah and Talmudic tradition by including both of these aspects of God and not the exclusion of the other.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CollegeGraduation.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4101" title="CollegeGraduation" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CollegeGraduation.jpg?resize=300%2C259" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I respect Dennis Prager. Often, I vehemently agree with him. Sometime I do not.</p>
<p>Last week I saw an article by Dennis Prager that I took issue with. But the topic has been <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/19/a-moral-argument-against-the-death-penalty/" target="_blank">already discussed on this blog</a> so I decided to let it go and not post a response. This week, another Dennis Prager article caught my attention. It also caught the attention of a writer at The Atlantic.</p>
<p>In an article on the National Review Online called, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/263877/why-god-isn-t-doing-well-dennis-prager" target="_blank">God Isn&#8217;t Doing Well</a>, Dennis Prager posits some interesting food for thought about the quality and quantity of belief in God and religion in America. According to Prager, God isn&#8217;t doing very well. I&#8217;m not sure where he gets that from, but he seems pretty sure about it. I don&#8217;t know if I agree with his assumption, but for the sake of this blog post we will assume he is right. Again, he might be completely wrong about that point. I just don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Prager blames the universities for the secularization of America. But not in the way I would have thought.<span id="more-4100"></span> He accuses the universities of a sneaky secular agenda that seeks to produce left-wing secularists. He proves this point by stating what I believe to be a fact, that the more education one receives, the more likely they are to hold secular and left wing views. I reject the idea that these two things are interchangeable. Secularism is different than liberalism. God can be doing just fine even if university graduates are becoming left wing. A victory for the left wing is not necessarily a loss for God. More on that later.</p>
<p>First, we will explore how and why university graduates become left wing and or lose their religion. Prager dismisses the straw man argument that he presents saying that University education makes people think more clearly, thus producing left-wingers, as false because of all the people he speaks to on the radio. They don&#8217;t seem very intelligent when they call his show, so the educational system cannot be producing intelligent clear thinkers. Again, I don&#8217;t think this is a very compelling argument. His sample size is obviously small. They are the people listening to him and of the listeners, they are the ones who call him, and of the ones who call him they are the ones he asks about their education. Certainly it is not a fair sample size to dismiss university education as producing clear thinkers. Be that as it may, I think he is wrong on far more egregious accounts. There is a much more reasonable explanation for college students losing their religion.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/why-college-students-are-losing-their-religion/236874/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>, Conor Friedersdorf writes just what I was thinking. For most people, religion is social (or driven by parental pressure). Your family celebrates certain holidays, goes to a specific house of worship, you live in an area with like-minded people and your social circle is dominated by those people who celebrate the same holidays, attend the same houses of worship and share your beliefs. It is easy to be religious under those circumstances. So easy, that one can coast along without consideration for one&#8217;s beliefs. It almost seems impossible to believe anything else.</p>
<p>At college, those existing social ties are broken. The umbilical cord is cut. Young men and women meet hundreds and thousands of people who think differently, look different, act different and believe differently. For the first, time, many people are challenged in their beliefs. They wonder why they do X and their friends do Y and Z. They see the world as a collection of many possibilities instead of one absolute reality that was being confirmed by like minded people back home.</p>
<p>When that happens, people question their beliefs. They question why they were doing what they were doing. Sometimes they don&#8217;t have any good answers. Without answers, their beliefs will disappear.</p>
<p>Is that a secret secular academic agenda? I don&#8217;t think so. Is it inherently evil? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Friedersdorf addresses God and religion. I would like to add one more point to Friesendorf&#8217;s idea and address liberalism. When we live among like-minded people it is easy to forget that there are lots of folks who are different from us. Seeing and meeting people from other backgrounds and ethnicities can open one&#8217;s mind to the various challenges, social problems, biases and unfairness that those others deal with. If you become their friends it is only natural to become concerned with their well-being. Social equality and helping those with disadvantages is a cornerstone of left wing beliefs. It is much easier to ignore people who are facing inequalities when you don&#8217;t know them or even about them. But once they become part of one&#8217;s social network it is entirely normal to be drawn toward their cause.</p>
<p>Again, is this a secret secular academic agenda? I don&#8217;t think so. Is it inherently evil? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Further, residents of big cities, especially on the coasts, are also more likely to be left wing. Is there a secret secular agenda drug in the water? No. It is the same theory. When you meet people from diverse backgrounds, social, political and economic equality become a relevant issue for many people. This, I believe, migrates them towards the left.</p>
<p>Prager makes a few other points in his article that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>He blames the clergy for being too soft on their congregants. All I can say is that orthodox Jewish clergy and teachers are very demanding and Jewish law does require built in models of respect and reverence for teachers. I believe these are good values. I am not sure if they are related to the issue of the article. But they are good values nevertheless.</p>
<p>Another reason Prager mentions in the article is the inability to deal with pain and suffering. Again, I am not sure that people are drawn away from God because of this, but he is right on target here about the failures at dealing with is. Theodicy has been a blunt tool for polemicists for ages and I think most people are uncomfortable with the idea that a man can know what God &#8220;intends&#8221; when disaster strikes. Pastors and rabbis are guilty of this and Prager is wrong when he says that the right wing elements of religions are better equipped to dealing with disaster than the more liberal sides. I don&#8217;t think either side is better equipped than the other. There are morons on both sides. Strident admonishments from televangelists about the wrath of God striking Haiti or Japan can&#8217;t be the solution that Prager is suggesting &#8220;works&#8221;. So I don&#8217;t quite know where he is going with this point.</p>
<p>Finally Prager blames the tepid response of liberal churches and synagogues to Islamic fundamentalism. I am not sure if the tepid response is to blame as much as the acts of cowardice and violence made in the name of God by radical Muslims. When people see the level of atrocity capable in the name of God, I believe, it is a turn off. Though I don&#8217;t know how much we need to have an &#8220;untepid&#8221; response as much as we need to reinforce the idea of our versions of God do not allow for such militant violence.</p>
<p>Returning to the substantive point in this post, we are all influenced by our environements. Rambam writes that people are drawn to the ideas of their surroundings. When the environment is closed and controlled, our beliefs are confirmed, unchallenged and easy to keep. This has advantages and disadvantages. When we venture out of our homes we encounter new ideas, new people and new challenges. How we deal with those ideas, people and challenges will determine the level of Godliness we integrate into our lives. It is our job to train ourselves and our children and our students to deal with the issues they will encounter.</p>
<p>I also believe it is important not to conflate political ideology and religious beliefs. There are plenty of left wing people who are religious and plenty of right wing people whose religious beliefs are flimsy or clearly erroneous. Politics and religion are meant to be two separate things. That&#8217;s the way the Torah system was in ancient Israel. The priests and the monarchs were from different families. And that&#8217;s the way it should be in America as well.</p>

He believes in God. He follows the Code of Jewish Law. Yet, he is able to reconcile all that with a purely academic approach the the Bible. It is a hard line but he is able to pull it off.</p>
<p>Whenever I have seen questions asked of him about how he can reconcile the two, he always remains unapologetically committed to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have heard a lot of criticism directed his way, by (even more moderate) orthodox Jewish rabbis for his research and teachings causing orthodox Jews that cannot toe the hard line to drop orthodox Judaism. This is really a criticism of some of his students, but I can understand how it is fair to attribute some of their demise to Kugel. Although, it should noted that Kugel has written a book to help those students called &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801859433/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0801859433" target="_blank">On Being a Jew</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I have never read any of his books. But I have read many articles by him and about him. Mostly as it relates to his being able to reconcile his academic achievements and his beliefs. Most of his books are academic and focus on modern readings of the bible by removing or discussing the assumptions made by believers when they read the bible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439130094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439130094" target="_blank">His most recent book</a> is different.<span id="more-4054"></span></p>
<p>A few years ago, Kugel was diagnosed with Cancer. It is now in remission but he published a book of his meditations, thoughts and feelings as his life hung in the balance and through his treatments.</p>
<p>Every single review of the book that I have seen, speaks glowingly of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439130094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439130094" target="_blank">book</a>.</p>
<p>Reading some of these reviews has produced some real good food for thought for everyone. Jewish. Orthodox. And otherwise.</p>
<p>For example, on the nexus of science and religion, this review writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many studies of religion, he observes, begin with the premise that once we understand the neuroscience and evolutionary biology behind religious ideas, we can move on free of delusion. But this is akin to suggesting that once we understand human courtship behavior, we can stop the nonsense of falling in love. If a sense of the Great Unknown really is a basic aspect of human nature, we can hardly expect it to go away simply because we have explained its origins.</em></p>
<p>And in the next paragraph when discussing the age old age question of why bad things happen to good people, Kugel answers one question with another question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Why, in spite of everything, do people persist in believing that life is ultimately fair? For Kugel, the answer has to do with the starkness of religious experience. In a world where man is very small and God (or the gods, or the universe) is very big, there is no room for moral ambiguity or indifference. There are only good and evil, and God must ultimately be good.</em></p>
<p>In the NY Times review, Kugel is quoted about the difference between how scientists view religion and how religious people actually utilize religion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The scientists “have misunderstood the most fundamental element of religious belief,” he declares. To the religious [&#8230;] religion is an experience more than a cosmology. “It is not God’s sovereignty over the entire universe that is at issue so much as his sovereignty over the cubic centimeter of space that sits just in front of our own noses,” he writes. “That is to say, religion is first of all about fitting into the world and fitting into one’s borders.</em></p>
<p>At the book event at Hillel Harvard, where Kugel is a professor, one student remarked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What makes Kugel so prescient is that he presents a religious philosophy that is fundamentally different from the Western, and especially the Harvard, model.</em></p>
<p>It seems that people are surprised and appreciative of Kugel&#8217;s approach. For many, religion has become synonymous with fundamentalism and perhaps even a backwards closed-mindedness. I vehemently disagree with that assertion.</p>
<p>On this point, Kugel and I are aligned. And in my experience, people do appreciate the Kugel approach to religion from what I have been able to glean from these reviews of his latest book. I hope more thoughtful books on religion will be published by out-of-the-box orthodox Jewish thinkers. It is a genre that has suffered a lot over the last half-century.</p>
<p>A little reversal of this trend would be a good thing.</p>

<p>He is smart, erudite, funny, honest and unapologetic. I can really relate to his agenda as well. I absolutely agree with one of his many assertions. That is, fundamentalism (in this case, religious fundamentalism) has caused much harm to society and until fundamentalism is eliminated, the world is in a precarious position.</p>
<p>Much was made about Hitchens&#8217; cancer diagnosis when he fell ill. Some took it as Divine Retribution.<span id="more-3990"></span> Others used it as a talking point and asked Hitchens if his illness was giving him pause to reconsider his position on God. Hitchens was polite and reasonable when asked even the most ridiculous questions. I was impressed.</p>
<p>Since Hitchens is an atheist it would make sense that he would pursue the very best medical care in hopes of curing or abating his cancer. So it is no surprise that he has enlisted the help of a top notch physician and is participating in an experimental treatment.</p>
<p>But apparently it is newsworthy that his doctor, Dr. Collins, is an Evangelical Christian. As if to say, that an atheist like Hitchens should not / would not utilize the decidedly non-religious services of a religious person. It boggles my mind that this is news.</p>
<p>Atheists like Hitchens are uber-rationalists. It would go against his core beliefs to shun a specific treatment simply because the doctor is a believer. Further, the good doctor and Mr. Hitchens are friends! They know one another as they have debated religion together.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail is using this insignificant fact as a talking point to gratuitously mock Hitchens and question his atheism. I&#8217;m not even certain what the author of the article is thinking. How in the world is the religious affiliation of Hitchens&#8217; doctor relevant? And why take pot shots thoughout the article? The poor man is dying, LEAVE HIM ALONE!</p>
<p>Just look at the photos in the article. The Doctor is smiling happily. I mean, of course he is, he&#8217;s a believer. But Hitchens looks downright mean and grumpy. Aren&#8217;t all atheists unhappy? At least that&#8217;s what one of the commenters on the article unequivocally stated.</p>
<p>And take this quote for example: <em>Hitchens, a prominent Atheist, he refused to change his views on religion even after his diagnosis in June 2010.</em> As if to say &#8220;How dare he be sick and stay atheist! I thought there were no atheists in foxholes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well apparently there are.</p>
<p>To me, there are few things worse than exploiting a dying man to make a couple of superficial points. Shame on the Daily Mail. Conservatives and liberals can agree that death is bad and illness is difficult for all. Make your points using real examples, sound argument and intelligence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/World-Religions-Flags-Banner-6330.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2894" title="religions" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/World-Religions-Flags-Banner-6330.jpg?resize=144%2C144" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/us/28religion.html" target="_blank">NY Times has a write-up on the study done by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life</a>. 3,400 Americans were asked basic questions about religions, religious figures and laws that relate to religion in America.</p>
<p>By now you probably know that the group who scored highest on the survey were atheist and agnostics. You may also know that just a slim margin behind them were Jews and Mormons. The senior researcher said: <em>“Even after all these other factors, including education, are taken into account, atheists and agnostics, Jews and Mormons still outperform all the other religious groups in our survey,”.</em> So athough some of the headlines say atheists and agnostics performed best, the researchers consider them to be statistically close enough to Jews and Mormons for the &#8220;Winner&#8221;s of the study to be Atheist, Agnostics, Jews and Mormons.<span id="more-2892"></span></p>
<p>I wonder who the study included in the category of Jewish? Was it people who consider themselves Jewish? Jewish parents? Practicing Judaism and religiously Jewish?</p>
<p>If it was anything but religiously Jewish it would seem that the Jewish respondents may have been less religious that their counterparts from other religions.</p>
<p>Also, most religions don&#8217;t teach other religions. The survey asked all faiths about all faiths. It would stand to reason that religious folks would not know much about the other faiths. So it is not a surprising result that they did poorly.</p>
<p>The two biggest things that I take away from the article are:</p>
<p>1) Atheists (and maybe agnostics) should have done BETTER. They scored an average of 20.9 out of 32. That is a terrible score. If one is choosing not to believe in God and not have any religion in one&#8217;s life, I would presume that it would after considering the options available. If proper due diligence was made before deciding on atheism I would imagine that they would be more knowledgeable about all religions than the 60% score says.</p>
<p>2) Many religious people are ignorant of their own religions. This is inexcusable. People need to do things out of education not ignorance. You can force any group of ignorant people to do almost anything a powerful leader tells them to do. You can get religious people to act immorally and perhaps in violation of their own religion if they do not know what their religion tells them to do. This is bad. Very bad.</p>
<p>Note to Dave Silverman who is quoted as saying “<em>Atheism is an effect of that knowledge, not a lack of knowledge. I gave a Bible to my daughter. That’s how you make atheists.”</em>: I have no problem with atheism. I think our world is designed to make it difficult to believe in an invisible God. Atheism can be a logical conclusion. But, belief in God is not premised on the Bible. Reading the Bible is premised on the belief in God. In other words, the Book is not a treatise on faith, it is a Book for those who have already believe.</p>
<p>Overall, the survey is disturbing on many levels. Let&#8217;s hope everyone does better next time.</p>
<p>Oh, and I took the 6 question mini-survey. Here&#8217;s how I did&#8230; <img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=980" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>When the proposal reached the Litchfield planning board the center was denied.</p>
<p>The reasons cited by the board were mostly aesthetic. &#8220;The doors will be too big&#8221;, &#8220;The building will be a monstrosity compared to our small quaint homes&#8221;, &#8220;The Star of David may not comply with the historic district&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Fueling the tensions are claims that the opposition to the center is anti-Semitic.<span id="more-2854"></span></p>
<p>Without drawing comparisons to Park51 (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/18/ground-zero-mosque-vs-downtown-manhattan-islamic-cultural-center-video-debate/">Ground Zero Mosque vs. Downtown Manhattan Islamic Cultural Center: Video Debate</a>) or the Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Lebanon (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/15/maghen-abraham-synagogue-in-beirut-lebanon-a-symbol-of-tolerance/">Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Beirut Lebanon: A Symbol of Tolerance</a>), the issues raised in the spat are issues that go to the heart of religion in America.</p>
<p>In America, Religion is tolerated. In America, if yours is not the dominant religion, please keep to yourselves and don&#8217;t impose on the rest of us. In America, religion is okay so long as it is not &#8220;in my face&#8221;.</p>
<p>But for the dominant religion? In your face is totally fine. Prayers before sporting events, political policy in the name of &#8220;religion&#8221; and even laws that are rooted in a very specific Christian understanding of the bible are all part and parcel of the &#8220;American Experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>My opinion: Less &#8220;In Your Face&#8221; Religion from everyone would be quite welcome. Christopher Hitchens talks about the modernization of religion. This is vital to living in a world with more than one acceptanle viewpoint and especially when a competing viewpoint is right around the virtual corner. Religion can no longer be bully, it needs to place nice with the global community and respect all traditions and religions, even those who have neither.</p>
<p>I am no fan of blocking a Synagogue. Especially if and when it is fueled by anti-Semitism, but if it were me building the synagogue, I would try to fit into the aesthetic character of the community as best as I possibly could and be as unobtrusive as possible.</p>
<p>So, I choose neither side in this battle&#8230;</p>

<img class="size-full wp-image-2751" title="Child Witches in Nigeria" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/child_witches_1.jpg?resize=300%2C202" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Child Witches in Nigeria</p></div>
<p>I saw this CNN article on a friend&#8217;s Facebook page.</p>
<p>There is a severe humanitarian crisis in Nigeria. I don&#8217;t know how much we can do to help but I think the crisis is emblematic of social issues in our culture as well.</p>
<p>Innocent children are being physically abused, even tortured or killed because they are thought to be witches. If a child can be blamed for a tragedy or illness by claiming they are a witch they will be outcast, then beaten and then abandoned to rid the community of the witch.<span id="more-2750"></span></p>
<p>Lack of education combined with the abject poverty these folks live under contributes to the social environment that allows for witch hunts. Lack of education and poverty in our country contribute to most of our social ills as well. Fear of the unknown contributes to hate and hate crime. While I don&#8217;t think we can do that much to change the environment in Nigeria (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/22/do-not-send-your-money-to-nigeria/">Do Not Send Your Money To Nigerian Spammers!</a>) we can make changes in our communities to help every child get an education and have an opportunity to climb out of poverty.</p>
<p>The video talks about a great man who is not gripped in the beliefs of these people and does everything he can for the accused witches. He maintains an orphanage for the abandoned and tortured children and unfortunately his facility is bursting at the seams.</p>
<p>There is a Facebook Page where you can help these children: Click <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=9476440119" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I suggest watching the video below and reading the original article on CNN.</p>
<p>One side note: According to the CNN article the exorcism and excommunication occurring in Nigeria is being done in Churches. It is being done with Pastors. It is a religious ceremony and considered to be part of Christianity.</p>
<p>I am sure nearly all American Christians would vehemently disagree with the beliefs and tactics of the Nigerian Christians. I think it is worthwhile noting that religious folks in Third World Countries living in poverty with little or no education tend to act irrationaly, violently and are extreme in their beliefs. This applies equally to Christians, Jews and yes, Muslims too.</p>
<p>Just something worth thinking about&#8230;</p>

<p>(What is Hijab? click <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hijab" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Most of us think of the black, shapeless head to toe covering when we think of the Hijab. According the article, the black color, and amorphous shape is not required in Islamic Law. Hijab is a modesty that requires that the body be covered completely by clothing. It is permissible to add color and style to the Hijab.</p>
<p>The article highlights some locals who are celebrating their personal style within the limits of what is required by Hijab.</p>
<p>I think that is great.<span id="more-2531"></span></p>
<p>It is really very similar to the way many orthodox Jewish women follow the Jewish laws of tznius. There are rules of modesty but in no way does that need to hinder one&#8217;s sense of style. Many of the drab dressing folks are just drab dressing folks, it is not that they are more pious in their adherence to tznius. Rather, they just don&#8217;t use the opportunities within the system to look great.</p>
<p>It is important for people that are religious to maintain their standards. But I believe it is also important to modernize the social things that are not determined by religious law. These Muslim women are doing just that. They are taking their religious law and strictly adhering to the law. But they are also making it more comfortable for a 21st Century Woman.</p>
<p>Just as some people are uncomfortable wearing the black, amorphous HIjab, there are those who are uncomfortable when they see women dressed that way. It defies the Western Standards of how women should dress. I understand how it can be offensive. Trying to adapt to a more current way of following Islamic Law is a great way to bridge the gap. The more common ground that is shared between the &#8220;West&#8221; and Islamic World the greater our chances of peace.</p>
