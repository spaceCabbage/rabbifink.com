				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I am asking my readers to <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/8f7499b69c08" target="_blank">head over to Medium.com where I published an article criticizing Slate</a> for their irresponsible reporting on a sensationalist and false story about Gur banning soy because it can make you gay. The story is not true. It was originally reported with no sources or evidence on YourJewishNews.com, a site with no credibility.<span id="more-7764"></span><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/oh_no_you_di_int_retro_housewife_b_w_tshirt-d23504043240443180228y9d_325.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7766" alt="oh_no_you_di_int_retro_housewife_b_w_tshirt-d23504043240443180228y9d_325" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/oh_no_you_di_int_retro_housewife_b_w_tshirt-d23504043240443180228y9d_325.jpg?resize=136%2C136" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote it on Medium because of the possibility for greater exposure. Viral posts on Medium have more potential than posts on my personal blog. So head on over to Medium, read the article, click Recommend and Share on Twitter and Facebook when you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope Slate publishes a retraction. And please stop reading YourJewishNews.com.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6164" title="_" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jpg-300x197.jpg?fit=300%2C197" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Slate has another article in their unofficial series on orthodox Judaism and specifically on chasidic Judaism. In this article, the Internet is presented as a supreme danger to Hasidism.</p>
<p>On this issue, the secular media and the leadership of the chasidic groups agree. The Internet is a Pandora&#8217;s Box for a chasidic Jew. There is no way around it. The article does an effective job of explaining why the Internet poses such a hazard to chasidic Judaism. I don&#8217;t think an honest chasid would disagree with their assessment.</p>
<p>The question then becomes what to do about it.</p>
<p>There are basically three choices that the chasidic community faces. 1) Redouble efforts to protect the community from the Internet. 2) Carry on as is. 3) Adjust their doctrines so that they are less susceptible to the harms of the Internet.<span id="more-6163"></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Option 1 can possibly work. The Internet is ubiquitous. The only way it could work is to literally kick anyone with Internet access out of the community. I doubt that this can be done.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Option 2 is viable either. The truth is that more and more chasidic people are disenchanted with the chasidic lifestyle. I don&#8217;t believe it is a greater <em>percentage</em> of chasidic Jews that are disenchanted, rather with the ever increasing size of their communities, there are simply more people who are going to leave. It&#8217;s a numbers game. If the defectors reach greater proportions, I do believe the community will find it necessary to address the problem vis a vis the Internet. They will either choose Option 1 or Option 3.</p>
<p>And so we arrive at Option 3. The article mentions that many chasids find the information on the Internet incompatible with the chasidic life. To a large extent this is true. But are those things that they find incompatible vital or integral to chasidic or orthodox Jewish life?</p>
<p>Is mocking evolution and science a necessary component of chasidic life? Is family planning a direct contradiction to chasidic life? Does chasidic life require that the non-chasid be stigmatized and delegitimized?</p>
<p>On these issues, the Internet is bound to &#8220;win&#8221; against tradition. There is just too much compelling information out there to even hope that tradition can stave off the attacks from the Internet. But these are not necessary beliefs to Judaism, rather ultra-orthodox, ultra-insular Judaism has adopted these as new tenets of belief. But these tenets are doomed to be forsaken by the Internet generation. They are just too flimsy to survive under scrutiny.</p>
<p>When one is told that the sky is green and the grass is blue, it doesn&#8217;t take much to realize that is a lie and the person who told the lie is a liar. Liars don&#8217;t make for good educators and leaders. Tradition cannot be passed down with lies.</p>
<p>In this respect the less insular orthodox Jewish communities provide better options for dealing with these questions. There are communities that handle these questions pretty well.</p>
<p>The other issue that the article raises is that the chasidic community has some built in &#8220;protections&#8221; that don&#8217;t squarely address the Internet, but they do make it harder to leave. Those are the early age of marriage and child bearing as well as the dearth of secular education.</p>
<p>This means that even if a chasid finds things that make a chasid want to leave the community, it&#8217;s really hard to leave. If one already has a family, and one already has a life on the inside, it can seem impossible to make a life on the outside. Especially if English is a second or third language and one does not even have a high school education. There are also the the benefits of staying in the chasidic community. If people want to stay, but cannot handle the beliefs of the community, you have a sticky situation.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the non-chasidic community can do a better job of welcoming and embracing chasidic defectors. There are many negative stereotypes associated with chasids in the non-chasidic community. Even if true, they are not the fault of the people born there, and it is incongruous to use those stereotypes against those chasids who are trying to leave.</p>
<p>I believe that with more viable and friendly options in the non-chasidic community, we will see fewer defectors file into the secular ranks and more ex-chasids in the non-chasidic community with beliefs and practices that are better equipped to withstand the onslaught of the Internet. But there is certainly work to be done in the non-chasidic communities as well. We&#8217;ll get there soon.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The answer to my question posed in the headline is &#8211; YES! Judaism can survive the Internet. I am not so sure Chasidism can.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/9-11-01-logo-300x285.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4592" title="9-11-01-logo-300x285" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/9-11-01-logo-300x285.jpg?resize=300%2C285" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>There are seemingly infinite ways to commemorate 9|11.</p>
<p>I plan several posts over the weekend to express my feelings, memories and hope for this important day in American history.</p>
<p>The first of these posts illustrates to me that 9|11 really has two components. The national component and the personal. On a national level we were thrust into mourning and war. It is a war that does not seem likely to end anytime soon. Every day without a terrorist attack is a day that we have won that war. But that war also carries a very significant price tag. Lives, dollars, foreign relations and other corners of life have suffered. In the end, we can only hope the sacrifices are worthwhile.</p>
<p>The more compelling component, that is less widely discussed is the personal component. By personal, I mean the effects of the tragedy on individuals and their subsequent stories of survival, rebuilding and healing.</p>
<p>The nexus of the national and personal stories is found in the media. The media is in a position to nationalize the personal stories. I find the various ways of expressing these stories absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>I have chosen 4 different media outlets to illustrate this.<span id="more-4588"></span></p>
<p><strong>ESPN</strong></p>
<p>On ESPN, the 9|11 narrative is told from the perspective of a sports fan. Great moments in sports led up to September 11, 2001. Agassi v. Sampras, Bonds hitting #61, 62 and 63 (of 73), Michael Jordon unretired. These seemed like important moments at the time. Nothing compared to 9|11.</p>
<p>Sports also played a prominent role in our healing. Getting back to business and playing those games told us and our enemies that they cannot destroy America and our vibrant culture. Sports offered an escape when we needed it most.</p>
<p>ESPN&#8217;s article is a must read for any sports fan.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/6937733/sports-sept-11-2001-espn-magazine" target="_blank">ESPN</a></p>
<p><strong>People Magazine</strong></p>
<p>I am NOT a reader of People. I noticed their cover story at CVS and I found it very interesting. The magazine chronicles the lives of children born to a parent who died on 9|11.</p>
<p>What a powerful lens through which to see the tragedy of it all. This is as personal as it gets. Yet, we can relate to it all through these almost 10 year old children. It also reminds us that we have a lot to live for. The next generation of America needed us to snap out of our funk.</p>
<p>I have not read the article, though I did see a video on the article and here is the short synopsis on <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20524377,00.html" target="_blank">People.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Slate</strong></p>
<p>In its inimitable way, Slate takes us back to when we had the Twin Towers. We see the Twin Towers through the camera lens and we are shown pictures where the Towers look small. They loom in the distance. The slideshow is called Tiny Towers.</p>
<p>To me, these photos are powerful and personal. They remind us that the Towers were part of the tapestry of New York life. Always there. Always tall.</p>
<p>But seeing them looking so small also reminds me that everything is a matter of perspective. Sometimes things can look so large. Larger than life. But when we pull back, the same towering ideas can become much smaller.</p>
<p>Our national mourning was so intimidating. But as we pulled back, we gained the perspective needed to heal.</p>
<p>Check out the photos here: <a href="http://www.slate.com/slideshow/arts/tiny-towers/">Slate</a></p>
<p><strong>CNN</strong></p>
<p>At the gym I saw a documentary being promoted on CNN. The idea of the documentary is to take all the details, all the footnotes of history and have them tell the stories. We hear from the ticketing agent who sold Mohammed Atta his ticket. We hear about all the minutia of the day and events that led up to the day. We hear from everyday people. It&#8217;s personal.</p>
<p>These details of everyday life give the event a more personal nature. They humanize it into a seemingly random selection of moments. But we know how profound those moments became.</p>
<p>This perspective reminds all of us that our acts and thoughts matter. Each moment can and does make a tremendous difference. Sometimes we can see it right away and other times we cannot. But it is there.</p>
<p>See it here: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/09/06/september.11.footnotes/index.html" target="_blank">The Footnotes of September 11</a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>In the end, the collective message is that in America we celebrate diversity. We celebrate different points of view. We challenge ourselves to have a voice and to hear the voice of others. Seeing just four of the myriad ways to remember on this 9|11 affirms the splendor and beauty of America.</p>
<p>On a national scale we may never completely win this war.</p>
<p>On a personal level we won a long time ago. We won on September 12, 2001 &#8211; the very next day. By continuing to do and believe in what make America great, each of us, as individuals has defeated each and all of the terrorists who changed it all 10 years ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/320px-Targum.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4583" title="320px-Targum" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/320px-Targum.jpg?resize=257%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Rachel Held Evans is an Evangelical who is living Biblically. And by Biblically, I mean she is following the Old Testament and the New Testemant, literally. She is going completely by the book.</p>
<p>Evans is making a point. She is devoutly Christian and like her co-religionists, believes that the Bible is true. Her point is that all Christians pick and choose which rules, tenets and beliefs they wish to keep and discard those which they do not. Therefore it is completely disingenuous to suggest that one way of thinking or acting is Biblical, part of the &#8220;Christian Worldview&#8221; or emblematic of &#8220;Christian values&#8221; when the same book that is being used to support those values contains values that are 180 degrees different.</p>
<p>It is a salient point and it has become a lightning rod (at least according to Slate) for many Christians.</p>
<p>Evans has used this project to take aim at several respected Christian leaders and as a result has even adjusted some of their thinking. It seems to be working.</p>
<p>Many orthodox Jews might think that Evans is living somewhat like an orthodox Jew. This is incorrect.<span id="more-4582"></span> Evans is living by the literal word of the Old AND New Testament. That is not very Jewish at all. But more importantly, Evans is living without an rabbinic interpretation. There is no Oral Law in Evans&#8217; exercise. In fact, I would venture that her life right now would be almost completely unfamiliar to an orthodox Jew. She is living like a Karaite.</p>
<p>To me, this is a stark reminder that orthodox Judaism is an Oral Law based religion. It is based on a tradition going back thousands of years and would be virtually impossible for us to accurately recreate from the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting to me is how I felt when I reading the article about Ms. Evans. The Slate article describes her as an &#8220;insider&#8221;. She is not making these critiques from an Atheist or anti-Chrisitan point of view. She just has a slightly different twist on her faith. She is not breaking any of the rules of her faith but is challenging many of the social, political and pseudo-religious aspects of her faith.</p>
<p>I try to do the same with my religion.</p>
<p>I like to challenge the status quo and conventional thinking. If only to allow for my religion to be more faithful to its history and be more inclusive. The goals and tactics may slightly differ. But my blog and talks from the pulpit are sometimes very similar in style to that of Ms. Evans. Just read the posts that have the most comments. Those are the ones that ruffled feathers and challenged the social, political and pseudo-religious aspects of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>So Ms. Evans, I salute you. And here is to many more years of making a difference!</p>
