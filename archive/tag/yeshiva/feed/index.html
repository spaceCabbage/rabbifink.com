				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/15246_4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7068" alt="15246_4" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/15246_4-300x232.jpg" width="300" height="232" /></a>This week I was in filming my father&#8217;s school in Monsey, Ateres Bais Yaakov, for their annual dinner. I always swell with pride as I get an intimate look at this incredible school. It is remarkable how much the students love their school, their teachers, Torah, and learning.</p>
<p>One of the highlights for me is always observing (and filming) a high school Chumash class. At Ateres, the girls are challenged to actively participate in their learning and ask questions during class.</p>
<p>In particular, Chumash is not so much taught, as it is learned. The students rigorously and precisely translate the words of the text, analyze the text for grammatical or other anomalies, and compile a list of questions for each verse. Only once that task is complete does the teacher begin to introduce the commentaries and interpretations of the great medieval commentators.</p>
<p>In this way, the various ways of learning the verse are not simply abstract interpretive choices made by great Torah scholars, rather they are solutions to problems in the text which give way to novel and illuminating interpretations. This is how the Rishonim learned Chumash. They were masters of diction and grammar. When they read a verse, they knew if the verse was rendered perfectly or if it needed interpretation. They knew all of this because, of course, they were experts in Biblical language and grammar. That expertise formed the basis for all their interpretations.</p>
<p><span id="more-7067"></span></p>
<p>i think it is great that young women are learning Chumash in the same manner as our rishonim. It was also really enjoyable to be a fly on the wall for a class like this and that is what got me thinking.</p>
<p>In my yeshiva high school we were responsible to learn the parsha every week and we were tested on Chumash with Rashi every Sunday. This way we all became familiar with the storyline and mitzvos in the Torah while also learning the most well known commentary. To me, it was a way to learn information. What does the Torah say and what does that mean? But we learned no skills (unless zipping through the Birnbaum Chumash with Rashi in English in 30 minutes and scoring a 95 on the test is a skill) and we did not get an appreciation for why Rashi chose the interpretations in his commentary. Nor were we acutely aware that there are many other equally valid interpretations on each verse in the Chumash. Certainly we had no ability to explain why each commentary chose its interpretation over the other.</p>
<p>Yet, at least in this high school, the girls are learning all of that. I mentioned this to R&#8217; Gil Student at our little <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101527642993025" target="_blank">Asifa</a> in Manhattan and he told me that he learned Chumash the way the Bais Yaakov girls learn Chumash in his left wing modern orthodox high school. (He also said that half his classmates are not orthodox today.) I can&#8217;t speak for modern orthodox high schools. But I can speak for yeshivos. The most rigorous Chumash curriculum mirrors my experience. Unfortunately, I think most yeshivos have far less Chumash learning that what I experienced.</p>
<p>I think we need to work on this. I think that we have a lot to gain by teaching Chumash the way <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/" target="_blank">Dov Bear</a> and <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com" target="_blank">R&#8217; Josh Waxman</a> approach Chumash. We need to cultivate the skills necessary and an appreciation for true Chumash study.</p>
<p>Learning Chumash the way our ancestors learned Chumash requires a working knowledge of grammar, an open forum to ask questions, and a little bit of reprogramming about our Mesorah. Those are all good things. As a side benefit I think this will help us meet some of the challenges presented by modern scholarship.</p>
<p>At the very least, every kollel guy should have a seder with his wife where she teaches him Chumash the way she learned it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Van_Gogh_Starry_Night.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4537" title="Van_Gogh_Starry_Night" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Van_Gogh_Starry_Night-300x246.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="246" /></a>It has been a while since my last Malcolm Gladwell post. That streak ends today.</p>
<p>On Grantland.com, Gladwell is critical of the owners of NBA teams. Currently, the NBA owners have locked out the NBA players. The collective bargaining agreement expired and the owners want a better deal this time around. Small market owners are claiming that they are losing money. They want to cut costs. The players have not assented to the terms of the owners, namely, lower salaries so that the owners can make more money.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the owners seem to be taking out frustration with each other on the players. If they want to pay the players less money they should simply pay the players less money. The exorbitant salaries for players who are being overpaid are not the fault of the players. They are the fault of foolish owners and bad management.</p>
<p>Further, there is an easier solution for NBA owners to make more money. Revenue sharing. That is how it is done in other sports. The NBA should follow suit and create a more equitable revenue sharing model.</p>
<p>Gladwell however, believes that the owners entire premise is wrong.<span id="more-4534"></span> His opinion is that NBA owners have no right to demand that their teams make money. The reason someone buys an NBA team is not to make money. Billionaires buy teams to satisfy a different need; not financial gain. This is called a &#8220;psychic benefit&#8221;. Gladwell compares it to owning a Van Gogh. One does not buy a Van Gogh as an investment. One buys a Van Gogh simply to have the Van Gogh. If the painting does not increase in value, that is not really a concern. After all, you have the Van Gogh.</p>
<p>The argument is compelling and he might be correct. Gladwell is basically saying that NBA owners have no right invoking economic principles when discussing their costs and profits. They did not buy the team as an investment so they can&#8217;t complain when their non-investment is not turning a profit.</p>
<p>Reading the article and thinking about the argument reminded me of a guest post on DovBear from last year. The guest poster is an administrator at a Yeshiva and he expressed displeasure with another guest poster complaining about tuition costs. Further, he expressed frustration with parents who don&#8217;t pay their bills as per their tuition contracts and prioritize their spending by placing education near the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>A serious, sometimes passionate discussion ensued in the comments. Perhaps the most salient point of all was made by DovBear: (And I paraphrase) &#8220;A school should be treated like a business and if it cannot run efficiently then it should not run at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think Malcolm Gladwell would disagree. Not everything that looks like a business is a business. An NBA team is only somewhat like a business. But it is more like a Van Gogh. You cannot apply standard rules of economics to NBA teams. Yeshivos also look like businesses, but I think Gladwell&#8217;s point about NBA teams can be applied similarly to our yeshivos.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t open schools to make money. They are not an investment. The standard rules of economics cannot be applied to yeshivos.</p>
<p>Yeshivos are opened for to serve the community. They are opened simply so that there are yeshivos for our children to attend.</p>
<p>I think it might be unfair to try to apply the common rules of economics to our schools. They do need to be run efficiently. They do need to be able to stay afloat. But above all, they need to stay open so that our children get the education that they need.</p>
<p>Certainly, we can demand excellence and we can demand responsible spending of communal funds. But I don&#8217;t think we can demand that our schools run like an investment firm, supermarket, hospital or coffee shop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of our yeshivos are not (yet) &#8220;Van Goghs&#8221;, but practically speaking, they really are.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/byu.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3867" title="byu" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/byu-297x300.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="240" /></a>Brigham Young University is operated by the Church of Latter Day Saints. It is a Mormon school run with Mormon principles. The school has an athletics department and has had some very successful teams as well professional athletes. Some of whom have even made the Hall of Fame for their respective sports.</p>
<p>This year, BYU&#8217;s basketball team is a national sensation. Their star player Jimmer Fredette is receiving national attention and may be the best player in all of college basketball. He has led the team to a national ranking of 3 in both the major college polls. One of their primary role players is Brandon Davies. Or perhaps I should say, was Brandon Davies.<span id="more-3866"></span></p>
<p>Davies was cut from the team today.</p>
<p>His infraction? He &#8220;violated the BYU Honor Code&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a Mormon School, BYU expects their students to live by Mormon rules. This means many things. It means no alcohol or coffee. I know. It&#8217;s hard to imagine college without them. It means conservative clothing. It means no foul language. It means no gambling.</p>
<p>It also means no premarital sex. 51% of BYU&#8217;s graduates are married.</p>
<p>Brandon Davies was not married and he had sex with his girlfriend. (I love how the university calls it &#8220;sexual relations&#8221;. How Biblical of them&#8230;)</p>
<p>Violating The Honor Code is not grounds for immediate dismissal from the University. But it can be. Davies has not been kicked out of school. But in a serious blow to BYU&#8217;s National Championship hopes, he has been dismissed from the team.</p>
<p>There is so much to say about this story from so many angles.</p>
<p>The first thing is that Davies signed The Honor Code so it&#8217;s absolutely reasonable for him to be kicked off the team for violated the code. Even if the infraction was something that almost all other college students in almost all other colleges engage in. I have no problem with him being kicked off the team. Plus, it&#8217;s nice to see an organization actually live up to their word.</p>
<p>The second thing is the code. I think it&#8217;s very admirable that BYU has a code that requires its students to live up to their version of what is right and wrong. I had a similar situation. I did not go to a typical undergraduate university. I went to yeshiva. The rules of Yeshiva make the BYU Honor Code look liberal. Although, coffee was certainly a big part of our day and alcohol was served at Shabbos meals. For the most part yeshiva rules are even stricter than Mormon rules.</p>
<p>I have been asked many times if I felt like I missed out on the &#8220;college experience&#8221;. I always answer, yes I did miss out on the college experience, thankfully. I am sure the BYU alumni feel the same way.</p>
<p>One more thing worth mentioning is the teammates that Davies leaves behind. I am sure they are disappointed, perhaps even upset. But they should also consider how lucky they are to play for a University that cares more about their morals and principles than making a buck. That is something we all can learn from.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>I blogged a little while back about the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/28/tough-times-for-private-schools-and-yeshivas/" target="_blank">pinch being felt in Jewish Day School and Yeshivas</a>.</p>
<p>The LA Times must be reading my blog because they finally caught on to this growing problem. Today<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-schools18-2009may18,0,7771174.story" target="_blank"> I read about the familiar names</a> in our Los Angeles Jewish community who are suffering budget crises.</p>
<p>Is there hope for our schools? Is it possible to sustain a system that requires such tremendous financial commitment from its families?<span id="more-570"></span></p>
<p>Last time I reiterated the Torah&#8217;s priorities for charity. Charity for Torah education is pretty near the top of the list. It is above non-education communal needs. Unfortunately, the public does not keep these priorities. I think this could help the situation tremendously but I know there is a lot more that could be done.</p>
<p>Tuition costs are nearing $10k for elementary school children and are significantly higher for high-school and secondary education. The cost are astronomical and aside from the schools failing financially, some parents are having a very difficult time staying afloat economically.</p>
<p>I want to harness the power of the web to try and solve this problem.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Is there a solution?</p>
<p>Can this sysem be saved?</p>
<p>Do you have a better system?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>In the last week I have read two articles in the NY Times that echo similar sentiments. I am proud to say that both of these sentiments are understood and utilized in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva" target="_blank">Yeshiva</a> system.</p>
<p>The first (earlier) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/health/24well.html?scp=1&amp;sq=recess&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">article</a> talks about the 4 R&#8217;s &#8211; wait I thought there were only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_three_Rs" target="_blank">3 R&#8217;s </a> reading, writing and arithmetic &#8211; the fourth R is recess. I <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/27/recess-litigation-big-problem/#more-271" target="_blank">blogged about recess </a>once before. I am on the case again today.</p>
<p>It seems that generally educators looked at recess as a necessary evil. It would inhumane to corral children in stuffy classrooms for 8 hours a day with no break so we are forced to provide some time for recess. Research shows a different attitude.<span id="more-399"></span>According to the article, recess actually helps children learn. Not only does it help children learn about life and improve social skills, recess also help promote classroom learning. This is due to some nifty science which if you are interested in reading <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/health/24well.html?scp=1&amp;sq=recess&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p>This means that recess is a tool for learning. This is the same attitude that Yeshivas employ. Really, all of Judaism employs this idea. We use our downtime as tools to improve our up time. We eat to live, we rest to be awake and we play to invigorate our minds. Recess is not a necessary evil. Recess is a necessary tool for good learning.</p>
<p>This comes back to the central idea that nothing is good or evil (similar to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/19/kosher-navigation/#more-377" target="_blank">this post</a>). Our world is full of tools. We choose how they are to be used. This gives them good or evil status for the action for which we have used them.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the second (more recent) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/us/25desks.html?_r=1&amp;em" target="_blank">article</a>. If you go to most large Yeshivas you will see students studying from text across or next to a study partner. The book is usually on a table or more commonly on a device called a &#8220;shtender&#8221;.</p>

<p>Why do they use shtenders? Because it gives your body more freedom and this will help the mind to focus. They just figured this out in Minnesota.</p>
<p>In Minnesota classrooms, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/us/25desks.html?_r=1&amp;em" target="_blank">students are given tables </a>that give the student the ability to sit or stand. &#8220;Teacher are seeing positive things&#8221;. Well of course they are. After years of suffering from behind desks it is time to set the students free. Not entirely free, but it is great to let students sit or stand depending on their mood and preference.</p>
<p>It is great to see schools fiddling with the status quo to find better, more efficient ways of learning. More recess and more freedom of movement in class are ancient Jewish ideas. They will only help the U.S. Public School Systems.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>My <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/rabbi-aaron-fink/" target="_blank">father</a> is the Dean of a Jewish girls private school in New York. It is a girls Yeshiva called Ateres Bais Yaakov. The government provides no funding to run the school however there is grant money as well as some other federal and state programs which contribute to the school&#8217;s bottom line. The bulk of the budget is set off by tuition and donations. Last week my father told me about the recent economic situation&#8217;s effect on his school.</p>
<p>It has been on my mind since then. Today the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> has an article detailing the current <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123301904801417967.html" target="_blank">pinch</a> for private schools and their parents.</p>
<p><span id="more-273"></span>In the observant Jewish community nearly every single child is enrolled in private school (Yeshiva). This <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123301904801417967.html" target="_blank">pinch</a> is being felt more and more in our community. Tuition is a lot of money and when times are tough tuition takes a back seat. This in turn has an unsettling effect on the schools.</p>
<p>Times are tough for everyone. When times are tough there is less money for the non-profits, charities, synagogues and private education institutions. We need to be more careful with how our charity monies are allotted. There is a <a href="http://www.just-tzedakah.org/guidelines/whom.html#ideas2" target="_blank">specific order</a> by which the Torah teaches us to give <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzedakah" target="_blank">tzedakah</a> (charity). We are told that our primary obligation is to our close relatives. The next level of obligation is to Torah Scholars and the institutions that teach Torah. Yeshivas is certainly in this category. After this we look to further relatives, residents of your city and then residents of Jerusalem and then the rest of Israel. Then and only then are we to give for communal needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for most people who do have the funds to give charity they don&#8217;t follow these Halachic guidelines. People like to give to cool and exotic charities before they give to their Yeshivas. Sometimes at the expense of taking a cut in tuition so that they can give charity to places that are lower on the Tzedaka <a href="http://www.sweeneyappraisal.com/images/Alaska/DSCN0404.JPG" target="_blank">totem pole</a>. This is wrong. Our Torah institutions are the basis of our entire community. These institutions cannot make it without our donations. We cannot forgo them and give charity to other projects so long as they are suffering.</p>
<p>Please remember the halachic precedence for charity giving and help our local Torah institutions navigate these difficult waters of our troubled economic times. You will be fulfilling the mitzva of Tzedaka in its proper function.</p>
<p>I cannot criticize the Jewish people for their incredible philanthropy and <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/philanthropy.html" target="_blank">history of charity giving</a>. Actions speak louder than any words. Tzedaka is a basic tenet of Judaism and is observed by almost all Jews regardless of level of observance. I am constantly amazed at the sheer number of<a href="http://www.jewishmag.com/26MAG/GMACH/gmach.htm" target="_blank"> public service and kindness organizations</a> within the Jewish community that survive on charity alone. We all give charity. But we all want to do it right. Right?</p>
