				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6361" title="8097381638_4188c0e0b8_b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/8097381638_4188c0e0b8_b-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>By now you&#8217;ve probably heard that Anat Hoffman was arrested at the Western Wall last week. You may have read her personal account that describes a harrowing encounter with law enforcement. I don&#8217;t know if her claims are true or exaggerated, but her claims are irrelevant. Nor does it matter what sensationalist headlines have been penned.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post we will focus exclusively on facts and then my opinion based on those facts.Â Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Women of the Wall is an organization whose &#8220;mission is to achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray, and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those facts are undisputed. They are agitators. They are trying to change the status quo. They are activists.<span id="more-6360"></span></p>
<p>Anat Hoffman is their leader and her mission is to agitate, change the status quo. She is the chief activist.</p>
<p>The Women of the Wall write on their website that the law at the Western Wall is that no religious ceremony may be performed in the Women&#8217;s section of the Western Wall plaza. Although this is not a primary source, and I cannot find the primary source (feel free to fill me in), we will consider this a fact as well. The law has been interpreted to ban women from blowing a shofar or wearing a prayer shawl and from reading the Torah out loud.</p>
<p>Anat Hoffman leads a women&#8217;s prayer group at the Western Wall from time to time. She wears a prayer shawl and reads from the Torah. On several occasions Ms. Hoffman has been asked or demanded to cease these illegal activities. She does not acquiesce. She gets arrested.</p>
<p>This has happened several times. Each time it happens the media gets excited about it, Women of the Wall gets publicity, and&#8230; nothing changes.</p>
<p>Supporters of WOW find the law offensive and the subsequent arrests and treatment subversive.</p>
<p>Traditionalists consider Hoffman a disingenuous troublemaker who deserves what she gets.</p>
<p>Here is where the facts end and my opinion begins.</p>
<p>The law prohibiting women from religious ceremony at the Western Wall is a law that is written by orthodox rabbis to preserve the sanctity of their holiest place.They honestly believe that a woman who blows a shofar, or wears a prayer shawl, or reads from the Torah is an affront to God and the Holiness of the Western Wall. My question for them is why?</p>
<p>There is no prohibition against a woman doing any of these mitzvos. In fact, R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein writes that women are welcome to do these mitzvahs. There is nothing wrong with a woman reading from a Torah scroll for other women. Nothing at all. To be clear, the law is prohibiting actions that are permissible according to halacha. I find this hard to stomach.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s grant the rabbis of the Western Wall the power to legislate the decorum of the Western Wall. While this may be offensive to non-orthodox Jews, I can also understand why they have control over the Wall. But the rabbis of the Wall are only granted the right to legislate the Wall in accordance with Jewish law! So it is reasonable that they would prohibit men and women from praying together. It is also reasonable that they would mandate reasonably modest dress at the Wall. But it is not reasonable to enforce a rule that prevents people from performing mitzvahs that they are granted permission to perform!</p>
<p>It is hard to condone the law as it currently stands.</p>
<p>Some people have a hard time giving credence to an agitator like Anat Hoffman. While it may be challenging for Traditionalists to support her cause, the broader message of her cause is universal. All people should be granted the right to serve God at the Western Wall so long as it does not violate halacha. It seems hard to oppose that kind of rule.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really feel bad for Ms. Hoffman. She knows what is coming to her when she agitates the establishment. But just because she knows what is coming to her, that does not mean that her battle is not my battle. I empathize with Ms. Hoffman and I support her right to worship God at her holiest of places so long as she conforms to halacha. She has. Getting arrested for following halacha and doing a mitzvah at the Western Wall should not be the norm. This is a form of religious persecution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only the more liberal branches of Judaism have publically supported Ms. Hoffman.</p>
<p>This is the least effective way to change the established rules. Hopefully, the powers that be at the Western Wall will see the beauty and value in allowing women to pray in accordance with halacha even if it is not in accordance with their personal preferences and standards.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6127" title="Haredi-Secular" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160" /></a>This week&#8217;s Time Magazine features a cover story on Jerusalem. Although, it is not an article about the BBC pretending that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel, nor is it an article about East Jerusalem Arabs trying to attain Israeli citizenship. The article is about the cultural war and the turf war between secular Jews and ultra-orthodox / charedi Jews in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The focus of the article is on one &#8220;mixed&#8221; neighborhood where the charedi presence has significantly increased as the secular presence has decreased. Although the article is talking about a few individuals, the behavior described in the article can best be described as juvenile. Both sides have their villains, and in their attempt to gain control over the neighborhood both sides play pranks, vandalize, intimidate, and in general refuse to communicate.<span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p>Sure, the article makes some technical mistakes and some incorrect assumptions, but I don&#8217;t really care about that. What I do care about is how the sad truth that in today&#8217;s society some Jews can&#8217;t figure out how to get along with each other unless the other person is just like them. That story is a story being repeated over and over again in many communities around the world.</p>
<p>Our schools and shuls are becoming more and more monolithic, our attitude toward the outside is becoming less and less tolerant, and what we are willing to do and sacrifice is becoming greater and greater for the sake of insularity. I find this trend disturbing on many levels. But the situation in Israel demonstrates to a certain degree the logical conclusion to this cycle.</p>
<p>It is a very sad state of affairs when we cannot even live happily amongst Jews. I don&#8217;t excuse the secular guerrilla warfare exposed in Time Magazine such as cutting eruv wires or slapping nude posters on synagogue walls. That is disgraceful behavior. But I also don&#8217;t excuse bullying people out of their homes or enforcing tznius standards on non-religious people.</p>
<p>If all the energy that is being used to outsmart and outwit the other side was used to figuring out how to live together, all the problems would certainly be solved. But it&#8217;s not even an option anymore. The baseline standard is to live apart from one another. I find this very sad.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that Time Magazine is a particularly good venue for this discussion, but it is a discussion that must take place. Is the goal to have a city like Jerusalem completely charedi? Is that what we are striving for? Is that what God wants from us? Will that city be a place that we can all be proud of? Is it moral to impose our religious standards on others?</p>
<p>Honestly, I can&#8217;t answer those questions with any sense of certainty. But those who are answering those questions with certainty, and are trying take control of Jerusalem or any other place in a similar situation, need to have satisfactory answers to those questions. If there is anything that this long dark exile has taught us, it is that being a minority can be very difficult. Especially when the ruling class has ideological differences with the minority. But have we only learned how to be an oppressive majority? Or are we capable of running a free, open society where orthodox Judaism can thrive alongside other ways of life?</p>
<p>I fear that the orthodox Jews who want to create orthodox Jewish cities are struggling with this. We know how to survive very well when others are in charge. Can we meet the challenge of autonomy without creating the same problems for others that we suffered throughout this exile?</p>
<p>I understand that the fear of charedi rule is mostly a fear of extremists. But the extremists are no longer so extreme. The basic standards of life in the charedi world may have been considered extreme 40 or 50 years ago. But now they are standards. Clearly, things are moving in a certain direction. The voice of moderation needs to be heard and the extremists must be silenced. If we do that, we have a chance at creating a united Jerusalem and other other towns, villages and cities as well, that are dominantly charedi but welcoming to all.</p>
<p>If we fail, I can foresee a time where non-charedim, like regular American orthodox Jews, won&#8217;t be welcome in our holiest of places because of our more moderate standards. Imagine waiting 2000 years to return to Jerusalem, only to be denied by our own brothers (and sisters). That would be a tragedy that we must avert.</p>
<p>Thank you Time Magazine for starting the conversation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Hereâs another post about my recent trip to Israel: (Read the previous two posts in the series here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/23/a-jerusalem-wedding/">A Jerusalem Wedding</a> andÂ Â <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/29/the-zilberman-home-a-thriving-jewish-family-in-the-arab-quarter-of-jerusalem/">The Zilberman Home: A Thriving Jewish Family in the Arab Quarter of Jerusalem</a>)</em></p>
<p>One of my favorite places in the world is the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem. The stones are soaked in history and the roads filled with Jews and non-Jews of all kinds seeking to hear what the Old City has to say.</p>
<p>A landmark of the Jewish Quarter was the Churva synagogue ruins. A majestic arch was all that remained of a beautiful synagogue in the Jewish Quarter square. That landmark has now been supplanted by a far more majestic one. The rebuilt synagogue dominates the Cardo / Square area. I was given a tour and some history that I would like to share with you.<span id="more-4064"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_4077" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 569px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110502.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4077 " title="P1110502" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110502-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="559" height="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;The Churva Synagogue&quot;</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">The original synagogue on this plot was built in the early 18th century by students of R&#8217; Yehuda HaChassid who settled in Jerusalem. In order to build the synagogue the builders borrowed a hefty sum from the local Ottoman Arabs. When they fell significantly into arrears, the lenders had the synagogue razed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For over 140 years the synagogue lay in ruin and became known as the Churva, &#8220;Destroyed&#8221;. In the late 19th century, students of the Vilna Gaon rebuilt the synagogue and it flourished again as the main synagogue for the Jews living in the Old City. It became an international symbol of Jewish pride and the center for Jewish religious life in Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the 1948 war for Independence, the synagogue was razed once again by Arabs. This time, not for a debt, rather for vengeance. After the war, the Old City remained under Arab control and the synagogue remained a pile of rubble.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 1967, Israel regained control over the area. The Churva shul was a priority and it was hoped that it would be rebuilt quickly. Ten years later, with no progress to speak of, the city built a commemorative arch to be a placeholder until the synagogue was rebuilt in earnest. This is the familiar arch that most visitors to the Old City will recall over the last 30 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, about 5 years ago, construction commenced and was recently completed. The result is a magnificent building which retains many of the same elements as the two original structures. The outside view is beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_4082" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hurva_Synagogue_1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4082 " title="Hurva Synagogue, Jerusalem - IsraÃÂ«l" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hurva_Synagogue_1.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="524" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From the outside</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Inside, takes it a whole new level. I felt like I was in the most beautiful shul I had ever been to. Once you get inside, the building takes on the familiar mode of many older synagogues with a main sanctuary on the ground level and balconies for women. The bima is in the middle of the sanctuary.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align: left;">
<dl id="attachment_4066" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110514.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4066 " title="P1110514" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110514-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">View of the Bima from the front of the shul</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The artwork throughout the building is beautiful. There are paintings above the entrance as you can see above. There is stained glass all around the shul. The stone work and moldings are exquisite. But most of all, I loved the paintings in the ceiling corners.</p>
<div id="attachment_4072" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110508.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4072 " title="P1110508" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110508-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tomb of the Patriarchs</p></div>

<div id="attachment_4069" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110511.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4069" title="P1110511" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110511-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David&#39;s Citadel</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">The ark is stunning as well. It looks like there are two arks but really there is just one. How would they use the top one!? Â The bottom ark is the functional ark. The Torah scrolls are stored in there. The top section is not an ark at all. It just looks nice.</p>
<div id="attachment_4073" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110507.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4073" title="P1110507" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110507-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The ark</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see, the synagogue is stunning. If you look carefully you can see the wall is made of two shades of stone. I believe, the darker stone is original stone from the ruins and the lighter stone is the new stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, greater than the physical beauty of the shul is the symbolism of the shul. Its original builders were chasidic mystics risked everything to come to Jerusalem in an attempt to hasten the coming of the Messiah. The next builders were vehement opponents of the chasidic movement. The most recent builders was the government of Israel. Now, the shul is maintained by the Zilberman family of the Old City. Four groups of Jews that may not share all that much in common. But the shul connects them all.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Isn&#8217;t that one of the points of a shul? To build community? To connect people who would otherwise be disconnected? From Judaism? Or even just from each other?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think it is. That is why I am proud to represent the Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach. Our shul also connects all sorts of people. Our shul is also a common thread among diverse people. The Churva shul is a model for us and others. I hope more shuls can take this model and implement it in their communities in the hope that we can foster unity among our people.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Taking it one step further, the Churva shul has been destroyed twice. And rebuilt twice as well. Our Temple was destroyed twice but only rebuilt (from scratch) once so far. We hope and pray that the Third Temple will be rebuilt speedily in our days.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, in our lives we too can feel destroyed sometimes. Look to the Churva shul for inspiration and hopefully we can rebuild ourselves as beautifully as the Churva shul has been rebuilt.</p>

<p>For many religious people, the most important city in the world is Jerusalem. In the early days of the city, after King David purchased the Temple Mount and the First Temple was built by his son King Solomon the city of Jerusalem was not where the &#8220;Old City&#8221; is today. It was on the opposite side of the Temple Mount. The &#8220;Old City&#8221; is a much newer city probably around 500 years old. It&#8217;s possible that people inhabited the area currently known as the Old City as early as the late Second Temple period, but it wasn&#8217;t formally fortified with the walls in their current position until about 500 years ago.</p>
<p>The Old City is rich in religious significance and religion. The Western Wall, the holiest site for Jews, is in the Old City as are the Dome of Rock and Al Aqsa Mosque, two of the most important holy places for Muslims. Additionally, Christians place special significance on several places in the Old City including the  Church of the Holy Sepulchre.<span id="more-4011"></span></p>
<p>The Old City is divided into &#8220;Quarters&#8221;. The Quarters are not a quarter a piece. They are randomly shaped and sized. The smallest quarter is the Armenian and the second smallest quarter is the Jewish Quarter. The largest quarter is the Arab Quarter. Very few Jews live in the Arab Quarter. (Now, there are more than there had been for quite some time.) One of the more well known Jewish residents of the Arab Quarter is a family named Zilberman. They are also famous for their famed (and perhaps slightly controversial) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilberman_Method" target="_blank">Torah academy for boys</a>.</p>
<p>It happens that a cousin of my wife married a Zilberman. But not one of the children of the residents of the Arab Quarter. That is his uncle.</p>
<p>He offered to take us to his uncle&#8217;s house and show us around. We immediately took him up on the offer.</p>
<p>The Zilbermans live pretty deep into the Arab Quarter. We walked through the Arab Shuk (market) and then up and around a few streets that I had never been on before despite my many trips to Jerusalem. I had never been through the main thoroughfares of the Arab Quarter before.</p>
<p>We arrived at their home.</p>
<div id="attachment_4013" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110550.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4013" title="P1110550" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110550.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In Hebrew: Zilberman</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Their home is neighbored on one side by a Muslim family and on the other by a Christian family. The three of them get along well. They share a cup of coffee (literal, not figurative) every so often.</p>
<p>The first thing that was pointed out to us as we entered the home was something in the threshold. It was a nook for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezuzah" target="_blank">mezuza</a>. The nook is carved out of the wall so that a mezuza can be placed near the door. It is nearly impossible to affix a mezuza to stone so the nook is necessary. Interestingly enough, the nook was there when the Zilbermans bought the home about 10 years ago. This means that is was either built for Jewish inhabitants when it was first constructed or sometime along the way a Jewish family lived there. That was very interesting to me.</p>
<div id="attachment_4014" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110551.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4014" title="P1110551" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110551.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The nook for the mezuza is in the center</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">We went through the doorway and saw the entrance-way to the home. It is a very narrow house with at least 3 stories. The bottom level is the dining room. The room was full of garbage when they bought the home. They cleared it out and removed all the rubble and created a beautiful new space. The Zilbermans host a huge Shabbos meal (just about) every week. Their entertaining room is used as a place to welcome hundreds and hundreds of guests into their home every Shabbos. The room is beautiful.</p>
<div id="attachment_4015" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110529.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4015" title="P1110529" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110529.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Zilbermans dining room</p></div>
<p>The real treat of the home is the balcony. The Zilbermans have several balconies. The uppermost balcony has a view that most Jewish people don&#8217;t get to experience. The Zilberman&#8217;s home is much further north than any other Jewish homes so that the view of the Temple Mount is more straight away as opposed to on an angle. From the balcony there is a clear view of the Temple Mount square. The stone tiling on the floor of the Temple Mount is a rare sight for Jews seeing as we are prohibited from approaching the Temple Mount by Jewish law and the views from the Jewish Quarter don&#8217;t quite get the right angle. Here is the view looking a bit south from the Zilberman&#8217;s balcony. If you look carefully to the left of the photo you can make out some of the Temple Mount floor.</p>
<div id="attachment_4016" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110537.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4016" title="P1110537" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110537.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View from the Zilberman&#39;s balcony</p></div>
<p>After we took some photos from the balcony we went back down to the dining room for some group photos and to ask a few more questions. Down there we also saw a very old cistern in the dining room bathroom. They also have an album of the construction of their home while they were living there. It was a very ambitious project and it turned out really well. I also got to take a photo with my wife&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s husband (a Zilberman) and just writing that, makes me realize how fortunate I am to have such wonderful family to share experiences and learn from.</p>
<div id="attachment_4017" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110549.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4017" title="P1110549" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110549.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me and my wife&#39;s cousin&#39;s husband (it was cold and rainy - hence the sweater and coat)</p></div>
<p>Before we left I just had to ask how their relationship was with their non-Jewish neighbors. The answer was that they got along really well. As I mentioned above, they have coffee together every now and again. They consider their non-Jewish neighbors their friends. I asked what happens between them when there is tension or even terror attacks. I was told that their relationship is unaffected by the actions and rhetoric of others. They have mutual respect for one another and what happens politically or militarily is not of very important consequence between friends. I have to say, I was impressed with that approach and it mirrors my personal experiences as well.</p>
<p>The Zilbermans believe that they are doing good work by making a kiddush Hashem in an area that is generally devoid of Jewish influence and spirituality. They are doing a great job at that. I believe that they are a wonderful example of devotion to religion and tolerance.</p>
<p>We all can learn from them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/65-1995.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3952" title="65-1995" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/65-1995.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="259" /></a>A couple weeks ago I traveled to Jerusalem for a wedding. The marriage was a marriage of an American yeshiva boy and an Israeli girl. It was a marriage of cultures as well.</p>
<p>The wedding was beautiful. I had a really great time celebrating together with the other revelers that evening, But I couldn&#8217;t help but take note of some of the subtle and not so subtle differences I noticed between this wedding and all the other weddings I have attended.</p>
<p>At American Jewish Weddings, there is a pomp, circumstance and pageantry. Orthodox Jewish weddings are grand events. Money is spent like it&#8217;s going out of style and people expect a lavish affair. There is enough food for four meals per person with enough leftover to send to a third world country and feed a small tribe. During the chupa ceremony, men and women have specific places and most people are sitting. When the bride walks down the aisle people rise and quiet down.<span id="more-3951"></span> An MC calls up the various honorees who have been preselected and informed of their honor. The entire procession is done with deliberate awe and reverence. [I am aware that in many places there is a raucous din from the talking. But I am speaking about the expected mode of behavior.] The guests all have seats with placecards [sometimes the friends of the bride and groom are at a few collective tables] and the dais is for the bride and the groom. The band usually consists of 3 pieces or more. I&#8217;ve seen up to 20.</p>
<p>At the Jerusalem style wedding I attended, which I was told was absolutely typical of Jerusalem orthodox weddings everything is different. There are no seats at the chupa ceremony. Everyone crowds around a makeshift canopy. The women don&#8217;t have a real place to stand and the men are lucky if they can see at all. There is an MC, but he himself has no idea what he is doing (in this case it was me) because the honors are given out haphazardly. There is no procession. The bride and groom almost magically appear under the chupa. No one can hear what is happening, and it seemed that no one cared. After the chupa the guests went to the main hall and sat wherever they pleased. There were no assigned seats. The dais was for men on the men&#8217;s side and for women on the women&#8217;s side. Rabbis who felt they belonged there took seats at the dais. The band was a one-man guy with an iPod doing most of the work. [The wedding I attended was beautiful and a very upscale.]
<p>A big contrast in style. The pageantry of the American ceremony comes at a high cost. A cost that for many is too much to bear. A cost that goes against all reasonable thinking. Spending that much money on one night is a bit loony if one is struggling to pay their bills as so many people are. A Jerusalem wedding is cheap but it also comes at a cost. The wedding does not have the same feeling of reverence or specialness.</p>
<p>In the end, all weddings are beautiful and wonderful occasions to spend with friends and family. To this American Orthodox Jew, the cultural differences were worth noting.</p>
<p><em>May we share in many smachos together.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago I was a campus Rabbi for the <a href="http://jamoncampus.com/" target="_blank">Jewish Awareness Movement </a>at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC</a>. One of my primary responsibilities was to lead large groups of Jewish college students on inspiring trips to Israel.</p>
<p>Of course, the personal inspiration for me, was very often, greater than the inspiration for some of the students.</p>
<p>One episode has inspired me since the moment it occurred and it is directly related to today&#8217;s Tisha B&#8217;Av fast.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span>We always were sure to take the students on the <a href="http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=116" target="_blank">Tunnel Tours of the Western Wall</a>. For me, it was incredible to see the beauty and grandeur of the gigantic white stones at the original base of the Western Wall. The Talmud in Sukkah tells of the beauty of the Second Temple that Herod rebuilt. It is hard to imagine such beauty when we see the above ground Western Wall today. Erosion and time have taken its physical beauty. But underground the stones are a pristine white and appear good as new.</p>
<p>Our tour guide was always the world renowned Esther Schlisser (who has since passed May Her Memory Be Blessed). Esther Schlisser was a one of a kind woman who took these tours very seriously. She allowed no talking, no photographs of her and she brazenly single-handedly led us through the Arab Quarter at the end of the tour during the second intifada.</p>
<p>We began the tour sitting in front of a really cool model of Herod&#8217;s Second Temple and with the magic of technology it transforms into the current Old City layout. The route of the tour took us deep down to the lower Western Wall base stones and along the Wall below the Arab Quarter. What we see of the Wall today, is a fraction of the size of the original Wall.</p>
<p>We finally arrived at my favorite spot. There is a section of floor from the Second Temple era that has been excavated and this is where Esther had us all sit on floor. I really enjoy touching history, and walking and sitting on the floor where our grandparents sat 2000 years ago is very powerful for me.</p>
<p>Esther then begins to tell us where we are sitting and the great men who must have walked these same cobble stones. She then begins to cry. Esther tells us the following (paraphrased to the best of memory):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;These stones are alive!</em></p>
<p><em>My husband died many years ago. When he died I was sad. I cried for days, for months, but eventually, I began to heal and I no longer cry for my husband. This is because my husband is dead and we cannot cry over something that is dead forever. I miss him terribly, but I do not cry.</em></p>
<p><em>However, I come to this spot, the floor right in front of the Western Wall of the Second Temple at least once a day for the past 10 years. Every single time I come here, I cry. I cry that we are exiled and that we cannot see the Temple in its true grandeur and I cry that we are at the mercy of the nations of the world and we cannot rule ourselves as per the Torah&#8217;s command. Jews have been crying here for centuries. We will continue to cry until we are redeemed from this exile.</em></p>
<p><em>There is only one way to explain this. The stones are alive. The Wall is alive. There is a soul in the bricks that lives. Its voice is small, it is weak, but it is alive and that is how we can cry centuries of tears for a destroyed Temple. The Temple may have been destroyed but still, it lives.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A very powerful experience and one I think of very often.</p>
<p>On this Tisha B&#8217;Av, remember that we are not crying over a dead Temple. If it were so, we would have stopped crying eons ago. The stones are alive. They are kept alive by the promise that we will see a Third Temple. They are kept alive by the souls of the Jewish people yearning for their Temple to be rebuild. And they are kept alive by the tears we cry on Tisha B&#8217;Av every single year.</p>
