				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7292" alt="MATZOH-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>The NY Times must be learning Daf Yomi. Just when we all started learning about the laws of chametz and matzah, the Times runs a front page above the fold story on Satmar A (as opposed to Satmar Z) protocols for matzah baking. It seems that Satmar A, and maybe others I really don&#8217;t know, are not satisfied with the &#8220;<em>shmura m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; and add an extra layer of stringency. They are careful to use wheat that did not even become wet while it was growing. They grow wheat on a far flung farm in Arizona where there is no rain for months while the wheat grows.</p>
<p>Why do they do this?</p>
<p>Halacha requires that we use &#8220;Shmurah Matzah&#8221; at the Seder (and some authorities say all Pesach). Shmura Matzah is not synonymous with round, dark matzah. Matzah can be Shmurah and any shape. Shmurah means that the ingredients for the Matzah were watched to ensure that the grains did not become leaven by coming in contact with water and not being baked within 18 minutes. There are three opinions in halacha as to when the ingredients for matzah must be &#8220;watched&#8221; in order to qualify for &#8220;Shmurah Matzah.&#8221; The most &#8220;watched&#8221; that halacha requires in that the wheat be watched from the time of harvesting. That is why most Matzah says &#8220;<em>Shmurah m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; &#8211; watched from the time of reaping.</p>
<p>There are no opinions in halacha that require that the grains not come in contact with water before they are reaped. None that I could find at least.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on here?<span id="more-7290"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times tells us exactly what is going on here. Here is what Professor Samuel Heilman has to say:</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;the competition between the two Satmar groups — each led by one of two brothers — was about one-upmanship.</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“One is always looking to be more authoritative than the other,” Professor Heilman said, “and one of the ways they’re making this happen is over matzo — our matzo is more kosher than yours, we’re more scrupulous and careful over matzo baking than you are.”</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">One-upmanship in halacha. Nailed it. When so many of us are mitzvah observant we need to do things to signal to others that we are different. We are better. That signal is the extra level of stringency that is completely unnecessary. For more on this social phenomenon check this out: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/19/suggestion-read-judaism-as-a-first-language-right-now/">Judaism as a First Language</a></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">But I think there is something more happening here. While it is true that there may be nothing wrong with being extra stringent, this kind of stringency borders on silliness. The concern that created the requirement to use Shmurah Matzah is that the wheat will actually become chametz. If water comes in contact with flour while it is in storage the wheat can become chametz. That&#8217;s science. But it is literally impossible for grains that are still growing to become Chametz. Impossible. In much the same way that it is impossible for cooked matzah to become chametz if it comes in contact with liquid. Yet, there are thousands of Jews who don&#8217;t eat <em>gebrukst </em>because of that very concern.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Adding stringencies like <em>gebrukst</em> and growing wheat where there is no rain only makes sense in one context. If Judaism is a magical, mystical, mystery and our rational minds are useless to understand the laws of Judaism then it does not matter that there is no possibility of becoming chametz. All that matters is that water and wheat do not come in contact ever. Even if the prohibition is against chametz and not all wheat and water become chametz it does not matter. But if Judaism is a religion with Divine instructions that are supposed to be understood as rationally as possible and the rules tell us what our concerns are supposed to be, there is not place for non-sensical stringencies.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">When it comes to chametz, we are given specific instructions as to what the prohibition entails. The law requires us to be careful not to let the wheat and water ferment and begin to rise. It&#8217;s based on science. Anything that could help prevent that from happening is a reasonable stringency. But once we get into the kind of stringencies that will not prevent a violation of a prohibition, it is hard to see their value unless we say something magical is happening and that wheat and water may never touch. The thing is, that&#8217;s not what the Torah, Talmud, Shulchan Aruch, and responsa tell us. To them, it has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do mysticism.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Now I think I can understand why the NY Times found this so interesting. Growing wheat in Arizona so it doesn&#8217;t rain on the wheat? It&#8217;s irrational. It is religion without reason. It&#8217;s exotic, archaic, and mystical. It&#8217;s not the Judaism that so many of us practice. It&#8217;s a Judaism that almost purposely does not make rational sense and is purely mystical. That&#8217;s front page news.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Vayikra</h2>
<h2>Pretense, Arrogance and Salt</h2>
<p>The avodas hakorbanos is a defining aspect of our avodas Hashem. Sefer Vayikrah begins by outline the specific details of sacrifice. We are taught, adam ki yakriv the offerings we bring our us. It is as if we our selves are being put on the alter and being offered in the fiery pyre to the Ribbono Shel Olam. Only as give ourselves to Him can we strengthen our connection to Hakadosh Baruch Hu, the source of all goodness.</p>
<p>One interesting halacha in the avodas hakorbanos is worth closer scrutiny. We are told that both se’ohr (chametz) and d’vash are prohibited from being offered on the mizbeiach. <span id="more-3035"></span>The mifarshim, grapple with understanding the ta’am of this mitzvah. The Rambam in the Moreh Haniviuchim teaches that this prohibition is designed to assure that our avodas hakorbanos is different than the ovdei avodah zarah who do, indeed, try to enhance their offerings with chametz and honey.</p>
<p>Other rmifarshim look at se’ohr and d’vash as being elements of yetzer harah which must not contaminate the sacrifices of our avodas Hashem. They explain that se’ohr is representative of arrogance. Puffed up from their natural state, chametzdike products are reflective of ga’avah a sense of haughtiness and “I am better than you” attitude. Toavas Hashem kol gva lev, Hahsem disdains human hubris and conceit. Simply put, there is no place on the mizbeiach for arrogance. It is an attitude which can never enter the seder of our personal avodah.  Nor can it color our spiritual sacrifice in whatever we do.</p>
<p>D’vash is external sweetening. It represents pretense, and the notion that we can somehow try and sugarcoat our iniquities. It is the exact opposite of what we need. Hashem Yisborach demands a broken heart not a saccharine-sweet version of penance. We must be real with Him. Mistakes are made, but we can do tershuva and reconnect. However, we must do so without pretense and with out excuses. As such dvash is not allowed on the mizbeich.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one cannot help but be puzzled why a few psukim later we are taught the every korban requires salt. The Bris Melech demands that al kol karbencha takriv  melach! In light of the prohibition to offer se’ohr and d’vash, why is salt different?</p>
<p>In addition, once we are offering salt why is there is no shiur listed, l’halacha even one grain of salt is sufficient. Shouldn’t there be a prescribed minimum like so many other of the korbanic rituals? What does this teach us?</p>
<p>The Mei Hashiloach explains that the essence of the bris melach is a reference to Yirah. During maaseh Breishis, Hashem separated the lower and upper waters. Rashi in Vaykra tells us that the Bris Melach of the Korbanos was a promise made to the lower waters ensuting them that they would have an opportunity to connect with Hashem in the mishkan. “Melach moreh al yirah”, the act of separated the waters was a true act of din. It is reflective of our struggle between our upper consiousness and our lower consciousness and sensing the wonder of this separation fills us with awe. The salt is a byproduct of this awesome act that must infuse us with a sense of awe. Therefore, the Mei Hashiloach explains <em>shekol hitkorvosecha b’Torah, ub’avodah, ub’mitzvos yihiyeh biyirah ubazeh yiskayeim hakol</em>! Yiras Shamayim, he says, must be the ever present ingredient in all that we do. With it our sacrifices are deemed worthy without it they are rejected. Perhaps that is why there is no shiur for salt and why it is so vital. We know, hakol bidei Shamayim chutz miyiras Shamayim, everything is in the hands of the Ribbono Shel Olam except for our fear of Heaven. That must come from within. As long as there is even a mashehu &#8211; a minuscule grain of Yiras Shamayim in our endeavors there is hope and opportunity. But take the fear of heaven out of the picture and all is lost, indeed, all is wasted. The mizbeiach requires not se’ohr not d’vash, but salt. Korbanos filled with arrogance and pretense offered by the self serving individual who only thinks of himself. have no place in our avoda not then and not now.</p>
<p>This message must not be lost on our daily lives. Al kol korbancha takriv melach Our limud haTorah and kiyum hamitzvos need their salt (not honey and not chametz) So do our dreams. Too often we mistakably turn to se’ohr and d’vash to extricate us from our problems. They ususlly make matters worse. What we really need is to access the bris melach. Salt and the (yiras Shamayim it represents ) does not just enhance their flavor but it delivers us the Siyata Dishmaya to succeed. It is time we give it a shake.</p>
