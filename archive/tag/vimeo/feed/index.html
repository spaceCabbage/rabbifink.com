				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A viral-ish video (almost 3k Likes) released before Yom Kippur poked fun at the rabbi&#8217;s sermon. The video featured puppets teaching the viewer how to write a High Holiday sermon. They said to start with a joke (see here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/09/15/why-do-rabbis-make-jokes-at-serious-times/" target="_blank">Why Do Rabbis Make Jokes at Serious Times?</a>), then tell a story, then make your point, but keep it short and interesting, unless the audience wants to sleep longer, har har har. It&#8217;s classic lowbrow sarcastic humor.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the joke was &#8220;funny&#8221; because rabbi&#8217;s speeches are predictable and formulaic. Further, this is seen as a very bad thing because things that are predictable, especially rabbi&#8217;s speeches, are no good.<span id="more-7644"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7646" alt="Screen Shot 2013-09-16 at 10.23.19 PM" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-16-at-10.23.19-PM.png?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>People thought the video was funny. I didn&#8217;t. But I actually have a problem with the concept of the video.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption behind the joke is that speeches should not be formulaic and that rabbis should not follow a script. I think both of these assumptions are wrong.</p>
<p>Things that are formulaic can be amazing. Baseball is formulaic. Pitch, hit, catch, throw. Political speeches are formulaic. Hit the talking points, wait for applause, repeat. Movies and TV shows are formulaic. Law and Order is as formulaic as can possibly be. A good meal has an appetizer, main, a salad, and a side dish. Predictable. But delicious. Formulas can be wildly successful. Just because something has a formula hardly means that it&#8217;s not impressive or worthwhile. Some of the most successful things in our world are formulaic. Ted Talks are incredibly formulaic. And incredibly popular. It&#8217;s pedantic and petty to harp on the formula of the rabbinic sermon. It&#8217;s not a valid criticism.</p>
<p>The second assumption is also wrong. That is, rabbis are usually decent teachers and orators. But to be those things rabbis should follow a script. Rabbis are teachers not entertainers. We don&#8217;t want baseball players to juggle chainsaws and we don&#8217;t want politicians to tap dance. Why would anyone expect rabbis to do anything other than teach and lead their congregations? Why should rabbis be expected to become entertainers?</p>
<p>Sure, rabbis should attempt to spice up their talks and not be stiff or boring. But the video implies that because rabbis use a basic formula for their sermons they should be mocked. They shouldn&#8217;t. Rabbis must be creative within the bounds of the expected formula but that&#8217;s it. What do they expect? A variety show starring the rabbi? Improv? Ludicrous.</p>
<p>Spontaneity and quirkiness have their place but a sermon is neither the time nor place for either of those. Perhaps our society overvalues surprising and thinking different. Sometimes we need to not think different and certainly not to mock thinking &#8220;the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using a video to make fun of the traditional rabbinic sermon just before the High Holidays was not only in bad taste, but it only served to subvert the important role that rabbis play this time of year. It was a poor choice to produce the video and an even poorer choice to release it just before the High Holidays.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sermon formula is not going to change. Nor should it. Different rabbis will have varying levels of success at speaking from the pulpit but it will almost always be within the same framework. This video only undermines rabbis without making a case for how rabbis could even do it any differently. Rabbis are not going to sing their sermon like Operaman sings the news. Rabbis are not going to mime their sermons. Rabbis are not going to direct a three part play. They are going to speak and they are going to use common speaking techniques to get their point across. They are going to make jokes and tell stories to bolster the attention of the audience. That&#8217;s the formula. Making fun of it is just dumb.</p>

One particularly devastated area was the Seagate neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Seagate is a orthodox Jewish neighborhood. Many people living there are in basement apartments compounding the effect of the storm.</p>
<p>A massive effort was coordinated to try assist in the clean up of the neighborhood. Jews from all over the east coast (and I am sure some from further away too) organized a huge volunteer network and despite all their great work, much more work still needs to be done.</p>
<p>A very touching video has been produced that depicts a small sliver of the kindness amidst the destruction.</p>
<p>It is hard to watch and even harder not to feel a strong tug of emotions as you watch. The confluence of devastation in people&#8217;s homes and the outpouring of support from the community is quite moving. Equally impressive is the potpourri of Jews who came to help. You&#8217;ll see all shapes, sizes, and colors of orthodox Jewish men in the video. It is powerful to see the unity displayed for the sake of this relief effort. It was also cool to see my brother in law doing work in the video. Shkoyach!</p>
<p>Great job by Aryeh Gelbard of Studio 7 producing this video. Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6377" title="family" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family.gif?resize=300%2C208" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A bunch of people sent this video my way. They all suggested I watch the video and they all felt the video was very powerful. I needed to find 30 minutes to watch it. This morning I had an opportunity to watch it and I must say that I wholeheartedly agree with them.</p>
<p>The video is a student project (read: not very professionally produced) but sometimes simplicity is the most pure form of art. It is a documentary that tells the story of three daughters, maybe three and a half daughters, of prominent religious Zionist rabbis in Israel. I am not familiar with too many religious Zionist rabbis but I have heard of all three of these rabbis.</p>
<p>Each of the daughters is no longer as observant as her family. The film explores that tension in a very real way.<span id="more-6375"></span></p>
<p>In my opinion, the film is not about rabbis and daughter. Only one of the daughters seems to have been particularly affected by the fact that her father was a prominent rabbi. The other two could have just as easily been daughters of any orthodox family.</p>
<p>I trust you&#8217;ll watch the video when you have the time and I am sure you will have your own reactions.</p>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts on the video.</p>
<p>The fathers come off really well. I am sure it was not always so pleasant growing up as a rebellious daughter of a prominent rabbi. Yet they are portrayed at loving, down to earth, and genuinely concerned about their daughters. Especially Rav Aviner.</p>
<p>The daughters all seem really artistic, artsy even. I think this is a very important point. Of all the personality types that might not be compatible with orthodox Judaism, I think the artsy type could be the most difficult. Artsy types, and I know this is a generalization, value and crave independence. Freedom of expression and thought is a large part of what makes people artistic. Conforming to orthodox Judaism is hard for artsy types if they are born into it. A lot of Baalei Teshuva are artsy for the opposite reason. They left their homes and expressed themselves via orthodox Judaism. But I think it is still fair to say that the artistic Baalei Teshuva are non-conformist orthodox Jews. I think that is great. But we need to find more opportunities for artsy types who are born into orthodox Judaism, especially for young women.</p>
<p>Thinking about this from a rabbinic perspective was interesting. First of all, I am the son of a rabbi. My experience actually somewhat mirrored the one daughter (Bigman) whose experience was rabbi-centric. She was &#8220;more orthodox&#8221; than her peers as a child. I had a similar experience. My father was the principal of a modern orthodox school and we had higher religious standards than almost all of my friends. It was not easy for me either. Going to high school at Ner Israel almost turned that upside down as many of my peers had more religious homes than mine. Perhaps they balanced each other out. But I was able to relate to her struggle very much.</p>
<p>I am also the father of two sons of a rabbi. I know that it can sometimes be challenging for them to be the son of a rabbi. But in this respect, I don&#8217;t see their experience mirroring that of the daughters all that much at this point. I am not a super famous rabbi who is called away from his family too often. I feel more like a regular dad who happens to be a rabbi. But the video certainly illustrated the fears that I have in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>I am sure that some people will watch this video and attribute the issues these daughters have to their more open religious Zionist lifestyle. They will blame this philosophy for these rabbis&#8217; daughters leaving orthodox Judaism. This is burying one&#8217;s head deep into the sand. Amongst every kind of orthodox Judaism there are people who leave. There are daughters of every single kind of rabbi out there who have left orthodox Judaism. It is not a new phenomena either. It is a part of our heritage and history. I really hope that people don&#8217;t come away from this video and see it is a justification for living any other form of Judaism as a protection against this.</p>
<p>The most important thing about this video to me, is that it raises the issue of how to deal with children who are not following our personal choices. It can be extremely challenging for a parent when a child reject their way of life. Sometimes rejection is absolute. The parents are orthodox and the child is secular. Sometimes it is far less absolute. The parents are chasidic or very yeshivish and the child is modern. Or the parents are modern and the children are ultra-orthodox. These can sometimes be very challenging situations as well.</p>
<p>I think that it is very important that the parent / child relationship not depend on religious observance. It is hurtful to parents when children diverge from their parents&#8217; way of life. But that pain cannot be more prominent than the love of a parent for a child and a child for a parent.</p>
<p>Every child needs to feel accepted by their parents. Every child needs to know that they are loved for who they are even if they are doing things which parents do not approve.</p>
<p>In so many of our prayers and remarks around the High Holidays we note that despite our failings God loves us unconditionally. We need to be able to follow the lead of God on this one. If God can do it, we need to at least try.</p>
<p>Not everyone works the same way and not everyone can be exactly the same. We need to find a place in our communities and even in our families for different forms of expression. Sometimes those forms of expression may be in accordance with halacha, and sometimes they might be at odds with halacha. While the orthodox community cannot condone the breaking of halacha, we must understand that it simply does not work for everyone. If we want to have relationships with our friends and family who are not as comfortable in the box, we need to let them know that they can still be loved and accepted despite our religious differences.</p>
<p>Everyone yearns for acceptance. Clearly, in our homes we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. But even in our communities we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. The Jewish people are a family. We have all types and that&#8217;s just fine with us.</p>

<p>If my last three posts offended you or made no sense to you, I hope I can win you back with today&#8217;s post.</p>
<p>This is one of most beautiful videos I have ever seen.</p>
<p>It was shot in the arctic circle and demonstrates one of the more fascinating phenomena on planet earth. The sun barely rises above the horizon, moves a bit to the side and then sets shortly thereafter.<span id="more-4310"></span></p>
<p>Much of Jewish law is predicated on when the sun rises and sets. It assumes a fairly balanced day as far as daylight and darkness with variations for summer and winter. But I just can&#8217;t imagine a 2 hour Shabbos or 2 hour fast day. Maybe that is why orthodox Jews don&#8217;t live (as far as I know,) in the arctic circle.</p>
<p>Our world is so beautiful. Enjoy it!</p>

Too many people are going hungry and there is much we can do to help. Sometimes all we need is a reminder. This excellent video is the perfect reminder.</p>
<p>So in your Passover preparations, remember those who are in need. There is an old Jewish custom called &#8220;Maos Chitim&#8221; to provide our less fortunate brethren with the funds needed to purchase Matza, wine and other seder necessities. Don&#8217;t forget to set aside some charity for those less fortunate this Pesach.</p>
<p>Enjoy the video:<span id="more-3978"></span></p>

<p>Happy Chanukah, Chanuka, Hanukah, Hanukkah.</p>
<p>No this is not an SEO trick. And no there is no official spelling either.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a song hint&#8230;</p>
<p>Everywhere you go, you hear holiday music. There is a dearth of decent Jewish Holiday music. This has become a sore spot for many Jews. They want to hear overplayed cliches and appeals to emotion for their holiday too. I can&#8217;t say I agree.</p>
<p>Yet, once in a while a great Jewish holiday song comes along and it deserves to be shared and heard.</p>
<p>Over the next few days I will be posting some Jewish holiday music that I like.</p>
<p>We begin tonight with my absolute favorite. How do you spell Chanukah? by The LeeVees.</p>
<p>I need to thank my friend Rabbi Quinn for introducing me to this song 6 years ago. Thank you!</p>
<p>Enjoy.<span id="more-3384"></span></p>

For 99¢ you can play this lovable game for hours and hours of entertainment.</p>
<p>You launch different birds in the hopes of destroying the evil green guys. Yes, it is more fun in real life than it sounds&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s a lot of fun and has been the most popular game in the Apple App Store for a long time now. To borrow a term from Malcolm Gladwell, I think the game has reached its Tipping Point. People dressed up as Angry Birds for Halloween. (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/27/these-man-sized-angry-birds-just-might-be-the-geekiest-halloween-costumes-of-2010/" target="_blank">link</a>) To me, this means the game is ubiquitous enough to assume almost everyone knows about it.</p>
<p>Today, I saw this awesome stop-motion animation of an Angry Birds level which I find very impressive. This video was made with construction paper and a camera. No computer generated images or fancy animation. Just paper and photographs. Enjoy.<span id="more-3255"></span></p>

<p>I do.</p>
<p>It depends where you ask this question. There is one answer for the United States of America, the Land of the FREE and the Home of the Brave and there is one answer for the REST OF THE WORLD.</p>
<p>In the REST  OF THE WORLD there are 0 / ZERO / nil / Zed / zip / zilch / nada.</p>
<p>In the United States of America, the Land of the FREE and the Home of the Brave there<span id="more-2782"></span> are 2,600.</p>
<p>That is a lot.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain what this means. A 16 year old kid is involved in a homicide. He is found guilty. He gets a sentence of Life Without Parole (LWOP). That means that he goes to prison as a 16 year old and will NEVER see the light of freedom in his entire life. No matter how much he changes as a human being, no matter how productive he can be in society his crime costs him the rest of his life.</p>
<p>LWOP is pretty severe for an adult. But a adult is more culpable for his actions than a juvenile. Yet, me basically are willing to throw away a life for the crime of a child. I am sure we have all done stupid things as children. We grow out of them. Luckily for us we can grow out of them in freedom. For 2600 prisoners that will never have the opportunity to see freedom it won&#8217;t matter if they have grown up or been rehabilitated. The purpose of the Juvenile Justice System was once to rehabilitate youth. At this point, it is hard to imagine that is the goal if youth can be locked up forever.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty egregious, right?</p>
<p>One might be tempted to think that this would never pass a vote today. One might assume that if the legislature had a chance to give some youths who grew up and been rehabilitated they could have a chance to show that they are ready to return to society, the legislature would change the law.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fairsentencingforyouth.org/" target="_blank">SB 399 was that bill</a>. It was voted on last week. It failed. It was close. But it failed.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, next time it comes up it will pass.</p>
<p>In the meantime I recommend watching this 30 minute video on some of the flaws of the justice system as currently constituted in the United States of America, the Land of the FREE and the Home of the Brave. It touches on SB 399 and many other important issues. Please watch it.</p>
