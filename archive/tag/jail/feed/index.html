(As opposed to this &#8220;Great Idea&#8221;: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/15/an-interesting-alternative-to-prison/">An Interesting Alternative to Prison</a>)</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the front page of the NY Times ran an article about criminal registries. A few states and local districts are considering online registries for criminals similar to the online sex offender registry.</p>
<p>The offenses being considered as grounds for registration range from arson to animal abuse.</p>
<p>The basic arguments for the registry are that the public has the right to know and make decisions about law breakers in their neighborhoods. If I don&#8217;t want to live near a dangerous (or not so dangerous criminal) I have that right.</p>
<p>The basic arguments against the registry? There are quite a few.<span id="more-4267"></span></p>
<p>What is the point of the registry?</p>
<p>To protect those who know about it? Does it really protect them? Are you really less safe around a a known offender than an unknown offender?</p>
<p>To isolate the offenders? So that they have nowhere to live? No where to work? Will that help them get their lives back together? If no one moves near the offenders and no one gives them jobs because they are on a list, how will they reintegrate into society?</p>
<p>There is a registry for drunk drivers in Maine. How in the world does this help or protect anyone? Drunk drivers can drive anywhere they want. And they are probably more likely to drive drunk near the bars than near their homes.</p>
<p>There is a registry to murderers proposed in Illinois. Murder recidivism rates are very very low. That means that if a convicted murderer is released from prison they are very unlikely to commit another murder. So a list of murderers has low utility but creates huge stigma.</p>
<p>Not to mention the cost. These lists are very expensive to set up and maintain.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t these kinds of lists also give rise to vigilantism? I don&#8217;t know. But the more lists we have, the greater risk there is for offenders.</p>
<p>Also, at least in LA, most crime happens in certain neighborhoods between specific groups of people. (You know what I mean&#8230;) Registries of those kinds of offenders seem pretty useless to me. Spending tons of money to basically have a public list of gang members? Who rarely venture out of their own neighborhoods?</p>
<p>But most of all, the registries represent an absolute lack of faith in our criminal justice system. If criminals who have gone through the system are still dangerous, then the system has failed them. Why put them behind bars at all if they are the same person who went in?</p>
<p>If we are aware that the system is failing then the solution is certainly not to make a list of all the people for whom the system failed. It&#8217;s TO FIX THE SYSTEM. Legislation for registries makes law makers appear tough on crime. Tough on crime accomplishes nothing in the long term. Registries aren&#8217;t even tough on crime, they APPEAR to be tough on crime. We don&#8217;t need faux toughness to solve our criminal justice issues. We need reform.</p>
<p>The suggestion of these registries is a wake up call. Our system needs fixing. Rehabilitate criminals. Create social solutions to battle the factors that create crime. Get involved in the high crime neighborhoods and instead of counting collars, count crimes prevented.</p>
<p>Registries are a wasteful way of pretending to solve a problem. Sorry, it&#8217;s not going to work. Try again.</p>

(<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/29/my-visit-with-judith-clark-at-bedford-hills-prison/">My Visit With Judith Clark at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility</a>) I have learned a lot about the failures of our current system of incarceration and it sickens me. As a (relatively) outspoken individual I have made my opinions known to anyone who will listen.</p>
<p>I tell them that I am against prison in principle. I don&#8217;t think anyone should go to prison. It&#8217;s a waste of money and far worse it is a waste of a human being. People accomplish almost nothing while incarcerated. Society gives them a free ride and they produce next to nothing for society.</p>
<p>The first response I hear is usually related to the safety of society. That somehow we, on the outside, are safer if the criminals are isolated, on the inside.<span id="more-2713"></span> While this is generally true, most crimes do not affect the middle or upper class of society . Most crimes are not violent. Most criminals that go to prison have someone step into their place in their social circle and the crimes continue. I know this is a pretty weak position, but I think that incarceration is also a weak position.</p>
<p>The next thing that I hear is almost always a challenge. &#8220;Do you have a better solution?&#8221; To which I have been saying &#8220;I think so&#8221;. Prisons are as an old insitution. They hearken back to a time that it was the only option for incapacitation. The loss to society caused by providing criminals with a prison was worthwhile because there was no other real option. Incarceration is a old system that was the best they could do.</p>
<p>I propose that criminals be monitored. Conviction of a crime is a waiver of one&#8217;s privacy. There is no privacy in jail. Instead of tossing them in a cell and monitoring that way, criminals should be monitored by corrections officers. They can be mother or fathers to their families. They must find jobs, they must be productive members of society and  only if they lapse back into crime would they go to jail.</p>
<p>To me, this was a sci-fi idea that I had no way of determining its effectiveness or cost. Monitoring was a idea, but just an idea with no real data to back up the idea.</p>
<p>Last week I read a very well written article in The Atlantic (I don&#8217;t regularly read The Atlantic, I saw the article linked on Gizmodo) about Monitoring.</p>
<p>It demonstrates the feasibility of the idea and its preference over incarcertation for all but the most dangerous criminals. It explains how badly the current system is failing and the attractiveness of this alternative solution.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the article and I highly recommend the system as described in the article.</p>
<p>Currently, it costs about $50,000 a YEAR to incarcerate a criminal in California. No wonder we have a budget crisis. Monitoring is a much cheaper solution. It is a more humane solution. It is a more productive solution. It is the solution of the future.</p>
<p>The only question that remains is how long will it take us to reach &#8220;the future&#8221;.</p>
<p>I say, the future is now.</p>

(Read: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/14/ive-been-published-my-article-on-felony-murder-is-online-now/">I’ve Been Published! My Article On Felony Murder Is Online</a>)</p>
<p>In researching the subject of Felony Murder I was introduced to the case of Judith Clark by Professor Gilda Zwerman who accompanied me to visit with Judith. Judith Clark has a website all about her crime, time served and the way she has rehabilitated her life while in prison. (Link: <a href="http://www.judithclark.org/" target="_blank">http://www.judithclark.org</a>)</p>
<p>On Monday I had the opportunity to spend a couple hours with her in prison. It was very powerful.<span id="more-2684"></span></p>
<p>First, my overall impressions of the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility:</p>
<p>The prison experience at Bedford Hills contrasted greatly with my experience at &#8220;Twin Towers&#8221; in Los Angeles (largest jail in the USA). At Twin Towers there is a lot of intake and outtake. The inmates are constantly moving around, the entire facility is indoors and there is almost no sunlight anywhere. Bedford Hills is a sprawling campus with sunlight and grass. It gives it a totally different feel.</p>
<p>Also, the inmates had an different temperament from the inmates at Twin Towers. The women of Bedford Hills seemed pretty pleasant, there were a lot smiles and hugs and friendliness. At Twin Towers it was very much the opposite.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about Bedford Hills was their nursery / summer children&#8217;s program. They have great child care for children born while their mother&#8217;s are incarcerated. Even better is the summer program. Children stay in the neighborhood and come from 9-5 every day to spend the day with their mothers. The prison provides a nice outdoor area for them to play and hang out with their mothers and I got a great first-hand view of the benefits of a program like this. The kids were having such a great time being with their mothers.</p>
<p>On to Judith:</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that I could not stop smiling while talking to her. She has such a great energy and infectuous disposition that you just find yourself smiling the entire time you are with her. We talked for a long time about the crime and her Judaism and her daughter and her appeal (which she won but was later overturned for technical reasons) and her famous writing club and her pursuit of multiple degrees and her close relationship with the previous warden at Bedford Hills.</p>
<p>In short, we had a great time talking.</p>
<p>What was clear to me, was her regret for being involved with a radical group and her sincere effort to change as a person. I don&#8217;t think she is the same person she was 30 years ago. I do think that she is an incredibly strong woman with the ability to help inspire and change others. Unfortunately, she is stuck behind bars.</p>
<p>Her sentence was harsh. She pretty much asked for a harsh sentence during the trial. But she was young, immature and infatuated with a movement. That person is not in prison. That person has transformed into a new person who could do no harm the way she is now.</p>
<p>We put people in jail for a few reasons. Deterrence,  incapacitation, rehabilitation and retribution.</p>
<p>30 years in prison is a strong deterrent.</p>
<p>Judith Clark is not a dangerous criminal, there is no need to incapacitate her anymore.</p>
<p>Judith Clark is rehabilitated. I can attest to that.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t 30 years long enough for retribution? Retribution for driving a getaway car?</p>
<p>Seeing her in there breaks my heart.</p>
<p>But with my heart broken, I was once again inspired by Judith. Just before my visit was over she said &#8220;<em>If I died tomorrow how would I feel about my life? I&#8217;ve had a good life. It was severely limited by the walls of this prison, but I accomplished a lot and I am proud of who I am.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that what we all wish we could honestly say?</p>
