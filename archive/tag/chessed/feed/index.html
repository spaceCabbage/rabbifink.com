				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tumblr_mcteflcoTj1qggwnvo1_1280.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6469" title="seagate" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tumblr_mcteflcoTj1qggwnvo1_1280-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Many neighborhoods were completely destroyed by Sandy. One particularly devastated area was the Seagate neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Seagate is a orthodox Jewish neighborhood. Many people living there are in basement apartments compounding the effect of the storm.</p>
<p>A massive effort was coordinated to try assist in the clean up of the neighborhood. Jews from all over the east coast (and I am sure some from further away too) organized a huge volunteer network and despite all their great work, much more work still needs to be done.</p>
<p>A very touching video has been produced that depicts a small sliver of the kindness amidst the destruction.</p>
<p>It is hard to watch and even harder not to feel a strong tug of emotions as you watch. The confluence of devastation in people&#8217;s homes and the outpouring of support from the community is quite moving. Equally impressive is the potpourri of Jews who came to help. You&#8217;ll see all shapes, sizes, and colors of orthodox Jewish men in the video. It is powerful to see the unity displayed for the sake of this relief effort. It was also cool to see my brother in law doing work in the video. Shkoyach!</p>
<p>Great job by Aryeh Gelbard of Studio 7 producing this video. Thank you.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Chayei Sarah<br />
Sweating the Small Stuff</h2>
<p><em>Parshas</em> Chaya Sarah commences with Avraham <em>Avinu</em> preparing for the funeral of his lifelong partner, his beloved wife, our matriarch Sarah <em>Imeinu.</em> Interestingly, the Midrash specifically lauds Avraham as the quintessential man of <em>chessed</em> as a result of his taking care of the funeral plans for his deceased wife, Sarah. This seems puzzling and the <em>mefarshim</em> wonder why is it that the act of the burial of Sarah is made into such a big deal. After all, that is what Avraham or anyone would do. It is normative typical behavior.</p>
<p>Why would such normal conduct be the defining moment in crowning Avraham as the <em>ish shel chessed</em> for which he is known and the man of <em>chessed</em> who we wish strive to emulate?<span id="more-6447"></span></p>
<p>The answer to this query provides us a phenomenal insight into the true definition of <em>chessed</em> that is so important for us to a remember. Simply put, <em>chessed</em> begins at home. but more importantly, <em>chessed</em> is primarily about attitude.</p>
<p>Indeed, being a <em>baal chessed</em> is not defined by the big things which generate headlines, rather, true <em>chessed</em> is found in taking care of the little things, considerately. The act of burying Sarah wasn’t what defined Avraham’s greatness as a <em>baal chessed,</em> rather, it was how he went about the internment of his beloved wife that established his greatness in <em>chessed.</em></p>
<p>The message is profound. Each day is filled with a plethora of chessed opportunities starting from the very moment we wake up. We must attempt to emulate Avraham <em>Avinu</em> in each of the little things in life that seem to be routine or mundane. <em>Chessed</em> is found at the breakfast table, in our morning greetings in how we handle the expected and the seemingly trivial moments of life. Indeed, <em>chessed</em> is defined in how we do the little things. Saying good morning with a smile, making others feel important, being cheerful and kind in our personal relationships can all be acts of <em>chessed,</em> if we do them with care.</p>
<p>Being kind when it is not meant to be noticed and going the extra mile with attention to detail and having sensitivity for the feelings of others in our day to day lives enables us to live the legacy of Avraham Avinu each day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sandy-space_2382471b.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6404" title="sandy-space_2382471b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sandy-space_2382471b-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>For better or worse, tragedies have a tendency to bring people together. Sure, there are people who take advantage of trying conditions to make a buck, or steal a buck, or just act completely selfishly, but the overall feeling after a tragedy is to come together and help one another survive, grieve, and recover.</p>
<p>With power still out in numerous orthodox neighborhoods, Shabbos will come and many families will need to improvise in order to celebrate Shabbos. For most it will be a different experience than their usual Shabbos. So many people have opened their homes to family and friends who need a place to stay and eat and stay warm over Shabbos. It&#8217;s beautiful to see the camaraderie and concern for others in this time of need.<span id="more-6403"></span></p>
<p>It is one thing to open one&#8217;s home to loved ones or even to acquaintances. It takes another level of concern for others to open one&#8217;s home to complete strangers.</p>
<p>A website has been established for the Ultra-Orthodox community of Lakewood, NJ that is doing just that. The site allows people to post available space in their homes or apartments as well as supplies that are available. Obviously, these are people who are willing to open their homes to complete strangers. I find this to be one level above helping friends and family and deserves high praise.</p>
<p>Reading the listings warms my heart and makes me more than a little emotional. Seeing the open invitations is a real inspiration. It really is beautiful.</p>
<p>Although, for a city with as many orthodox Jews, it seems that the listings are a bit sporadic. I hope it&#8217;s because there are too few people with power and Internet access. Let&#8217;s give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they would have more listings if it were possible.</p>
<p>If you know anyone who could make use of this service even at this late hour, please alert them to these listings. If you</p>
<p>We should be proud of this venture and let us hope and pray that everyone is comfortable and safe over Shabbos. In the long run, let us strive to establish ourselves as a community that rises to this level of kindness even when we are not forced to do so by tragedy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombstone.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5719" title="tombstone" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombstone-300x178.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="178" /></a>An older, single gentleman in my shul lost his mother last year. We both flew to New York for the funeral in West Babylon on Long Island, where my father and father-in-law met us with a minyan of my personal friends and family who took 5 hours out of their time to participate in the mitzvah of giving proper honor to the dead. The surviving son had no friends and (welcome) family in New York (although one relative couple did crash the funeral just to make trouble) and the effort these people made to be at the funeral was really appreciated.</p>
<p>This week, we arranged for an unveiling and once again I was responsible to find a minyan. While an unveiling can be done without a minyan, the gentleman really wanted to say kaddish at his mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s graves, especially because he rarely makes the trip from Los Angeles to New York. As it were, both my father and father in law were unable to arrange their schedules to join us. I had one friend who was able to come and one brother in law who was able to be there as well.</p>
<p>That left us six people short.</p>
<p>So I took to social media. I posted a notice on Facebook and Twitter. I got a lot of responses. It was really encouraging and I thought it was great that we could use the Internet for chessed.<span id="more-5718"></span> Most people wanted to know what I needed help doing and when I told them, they were unable to make the trip. That was fine and I appreciated their interest and that they reached out to me.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to find six people. Notices were placed on community lists. They generated no interest. No one was interested in making the trip.</p>
<p>Only three people volunteered to come and were actually able to make the trip. These three people shared one thing. They were all Jewish men who were orthodox (or chasidic) in the younger years and had made the choice to leave orthodox Judaism later on in life.</p>
<p>I was thrilled to have these three volunteers and two of them even offered to bring friends along. One friend was able to come and the other could not. So I had four volunteers. All ex-orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>It was well after midnight the night before the 11 AM ceremony and I was frantic on gChat trying to find a couple more people. I asked a few people directly if they could please do me a favor and come to the unveiling. Luckily my new friend Dovid Teitlebaum was willing to make the trip and bring a couple teenage guys.<em> [Thank you SO MUCH, Dovid. You really saved me!]</em> I had my minyan.</p>
<p>Of the eleven people who I was expecting, 10 made it on time(-ish). The eleventh guy miscalculated his travel time. But he made it just as we were wrapping things up. We did the ceremony. Everyone was very respectful and played their role perfectly. The gentleman was so appreciative and so was I. It meant a lot to both of us that we were able to arrange a minyan.</p>
<p>It was especially meaningful that some people volunteered to take time out of their day to make a minyan. It was interesting that the volunteers were no longer orthodox Jews.</p>
<p><em>[I could end here and let you draw your own conclusions and formulate your own thoughts. But I will continue and share what I am thinking.]</em></p>
<p>Orthodox Jews, as has been well documented, are overwhelmingly charitable with their time and money. Usually, orthodox Jews can be counted on for acts of selfless kindness that go well beyond what is normal. So what happened here?</p>
<p>It could just be that this was an anomaly. Or that no one wants to help me because they don&#8217;t like me. Who knows?</p>
<p>But I have a little theory. Halacha drives so much of orthodox Jewish life. In halacha there is no need for a minyan at an unveiling. Therefore, making the minyan for an unveiling is not looked at as such a priority. Other concerns take precedent in the hierarchy of halacha. That is fine. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that.</p>
<p>It just strikes me that when one takes halacha out of the calculation, making this minyan clearly meant a lot to this gentleman and to me. Forget about halacha for a second. It was clearly a really nice thing to do. It clearly would have made this gentleman feel so good. It clearly would have helped me. It seems so obvious that helping making the minyan was a good and nice and helpful and generous thing to do.</p>
<p>So, I think sometimes it takes someone outside the system to see past the trees and notice the forest. But it reminds us that we, who are meticulous about halacha, can&#8217;t forget to see the forest as well. Would I have volunteered if someone I knew or barely knew asked for my help making a minyan for an unveiling? Probably not.</p>
<p>Have these four men inspired me to say yes next time? Yes they have. Absolutely.</p>
<p>So <strong>Joshie</strong>, <strong>Yitzchok</strong>, <strong>Aly</strong>, and <strong>Abe</strong>, thank you for being the volunteers and making the minyan, but most of all thank you for reminding me to see the forest, not just the trees and inspiring me to say YES next time I can do a nice thing for someone else.</p>

We are proud of our diversity and it strengthens our community to be inclusive and foster relationships with a variety of people. Within our shul there are Jews of every flavor. There are those who identify as Ashkenaz, Sefard, Lubavitch, Reform, Conservative, Modern Orthodox, Centrist Orthodox, Yeshivish as well as some converts. It really is unique.</p>
<p>Many of the young men and women who grew up in the community before I became the rabbi have gone on to achieve great things in their lives. Some are professionals, some are studying Torah day and night, some are academics and some have become big &#8220;baalei chessed&#8221; (pracitioners of unabated love and kindness). The baalei chessed are probably the unsung heroes of the group. They are humble and do their good works quietly, without fanfare and without seeking recognition.</p>
<p>One of those young women, is <strong>Jesse Risch</strong>,<span id="more-3278"></span> daugher of (Board Member) <strong>Alan</strong> and <strong>Rachel Risch</strong>. Jesse Risch is working in Thailand with the American Jewish World Service (<a href="http://www.awjs.org" target="_blank">www.awjs.org</a>). The AWJS is similar to the Peace Corps. I asked Jesse why she was going to Thailand and what she is going to be doing there. She has been in Thailand for a few weeks now and this was her response to me before she left.</p>
<p>In her own words (with a little editing):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I&#8217;m participating in the volunteer service corps which places volunteers from all over the world with organizations (NGOs) in developing countries for a period of three months to a year. They have other programs as well to spur development in growing nations, namely a year-long service corps and a few alternative spring break trips for college students/young professionals.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I&#8217;m going to Southeast Asia to work with a youth organization that focuses on empowering and educating Burmese refugee youth, status-less, displaced persons in Thailand that are restricted from accessing public education and health services. Refugee populations tend to be at high risk for [sex] trafficking as well as HIV/Aids and unwanted pregnancies. I am particularly interested in this aspect of the work- helping educate and empower youth to give them hope and the ability to prosper, rather than fall victim to the aforementioned.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I will specifically be working with the organization&#8217;s staff to help them build up capacity- reviewing their programs and curriculum, conducting development/fundraising efforts, and teaching them English.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The American Jewish World Service is driven by the Jewish concept of tikkun olam- and that it is our collective responsibility to help heal the world. This is my own guiding motto as well, and I whole heartedly believe that as Jews we have this obligation to help others, even those outside of our own community, and outside of our comfort zone. I&#8217;m really excited to have the opportunity to take part in this type of work.</em></p>
<p>I can speak for myself and the entire community when I say that Jesse is doing great work and I salute her. Life is long enough that we can take the time to contribute some of our time to those less fortunate than us. Even if we don&#8217;t go all the way to Thailand, there are people in our lives that could use a little help now and then. We can all find to time to help others and follow in the footsteps of Jesse who is blazing the trail of chessed for all of us.</p>
<p>On a side note, I think this is a wonderful way for young men and women to spend a few months. Most orthodox Jewish high school graduates spend at least one year in Israel. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if more of them participated in a program like this as well? I think so.</p>
<p>I hope to post a report from Jesse in the next few months. In the meantime, Jesse, keep up the great work!</p>
<p>Here is a video of the AWJS doing work in India:</p>

<h1><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #000000;">Chessed L&#8217;Avraham</span></span></h1>
<p>The beginning of Parshas Vayera describes the hospitality uniquely associated with the home of Avraham Avinu and Sarah Imeinu. The psukim are filled with practical lessons in the “how to’s” of Chessed. The entire scenario with the malachim visiting Avraham as he recovers is inspiring.</p>
<p>One phrase in the story, v’hu omeid aleohem tachas haeitz vayocheilu encapsulates the art of being a ba’al chessed, a master of Chessed, teaching us how to give and how to receive. We learn that despite the pain of having just undergone a bris milah, Avraham, together with his wife prepared a feast for strangers. <span id="more-1646"></span>They not only presented each of them with a meal fit for a king, but personally waited on them, trying to fulfill their every desire.</p>
<p>Chazal derive a valuable perspective on the middah of chessed from this posuk. Kindness is also measured by the way in which it is performed. Surely, after Avraham presented this abundant feast, he could have gone back to his study and gone about his own business. He could have sent Yishmael, Eliezer or one of his other servants, to tend to his guests. This, however, may have been construed by the visitors as a lack of interest in their welfare. Avraham Avinu wanted them to know that at this point in time their needs were his most important and pressing concern. Acts of chessed are not enough. They must be combined with an attitude of chessed and a sensitivity to the feelings of others. Avraham’s sensitivity benefited us all. The personal involvement of Avraham in providing food, water and a doting interest in the welfare of his guests was reflected back to Klal Yisrael, midah kineged midah, in the form of the mon, be’er and annanei hakavod!</p>
<p>There is an art too, of being a recipient of chessed. This same posuk tells us that as the angels were presented a magnificent feast, vayocheilu,, and they (the angels) ate. Rashi quotes the Gemarah, which tells us that the angels made themselves appear to be eating like humans, in following with the precept of lo yishaneh adam min haminhag &#8211; a person should not deviate from the accepted practice. It is important to learn how to accept kindness from others in a manner that does not affect the sensitivities of the giver. Imagine how disappointed and offended Avraham and Sarah could have been if their guests, after all their work, would have said: &#8220;No thanks! We&#8217;re not hungry!&#8221; Hashem’s messengers model for us the role of “recipients of kindness.” Chessed is a two-way street. The giver has to know how to give, the recipient, how to receive, with each one concerned about the sensitivities of the other.</p>
<p>Still despite all the wonderful expressions of kindness modeled by Avraham Avinu, we cannot help but wonder why he is considered and designated as the Av, the father of chessed. After all, he was not alone in being a giving, caring and helpful person. Even Lot displayed a magnanimous nature and risked his very life when he greeted the malachim that came his way. So many personalities in Tanach are filled with goodness. What is it about Avraham that defined him as the Av of Chessed?</p>
<p>My father, Harav Berel Fink z”l, used to point out, that while it is true that there are many personalities throughout the Torah who were giants of chessed &#8211; when the need was there, only Avraham Avinu was a mitztaeir when he could not do chessed. Suffering pain when he was unable to be kind, that is what set Avraham apart as the model for us to strive to emulate. It is not enough to be reactive to need, we must be proactive in our chessed pursuits. So much so that it hurts when we cannot help!</p>
<p>There is so much each of us can do as we know, mirubim tzarchei amcha. We, too, must be so concerned and devoted to our fellow Jew that it hurts not to help whenever and wherever we can.</p>
