(See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/11/12/an-interesting-torah-temimah-on-nashim-datan-kalot/">An Interesting Torah Temimah on Nashim Datan Kalot</a>) This week I discovered another interesting comment from the Torah Temimah that I think is also significant but not as significant.</p>
<p>Parshas Toldos begins with a confused Rivkah wondering why she was experiencing a very strange pregnancy. The passuk says וַתֵּלֶךְ, לִדְרֹשׁ אֶת-יְהוָה. Rivkah went to inquire with God. The verse does not say how exactly she made this inquiry.</p>
<p>The commentaries offer two main options. 1) She inquired with a prophet. 2) She prayed to God (Ramban).</p>
<p>The Torah continues and tells us: ,&#8230;וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה לָהּ &#8211; God said to her&#8230; Here the commentaries say that she was answered via prophecy. It could be that the Ramban would say that she was answered directly, but he does not comment on these words.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah mentions some speculation that the reason that God did not speak to her directly was because as a general rule God does not speak to women (save for Sarah) as per the Jerusalem Talmud in Sota (7:1) (apologies to Michelle Bachmann). However, the Torah Temimah directs us to his commentary in Parshas Vayera where the Torah tells us that God spoke directly to Sarah. Here he quotes the Jerusalem Talmud and then expands on it in his commentary.<span id="more-6490"></span></p>
<p>Here is what he says  (translation my own, parentheticals are my additions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This exegesis requires explanation in general, because we have seen several women who were prophetesses, as the (Babylonian) Talmud counts on 14A, Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Chana, Avigayil, Chuldah, Esther, and is so how is it that the Jerusalem Talmud says that we do not find God talking with women, since these women were prophetesses he must have spoke to them!?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And me must say that God&#8217;s talking with the prophetesses must have been with regard to public matters, whereas with regard to private matters God only spoke directly with Sarah. And that which it says when God spoke to Eve and Rebecca it must have been with a go-between as we explained there.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Also we can answer this question according to that which is written in the Guide (for the Perplexed by Maimonides) chapter 45, where he counts 11 levels of prophecy, and the level of prophecy for women is until the seventh level, look there, and according to this it can be said that the intent here (Jerusalem Talmud) is that Sarah reached the level of prophecy that is the pinnacle of prophecy, and that is the level of prophecy of (King) Solomon, and this is not the place to expound further.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a huge thing, but I see this as the Torah Temimah trying to &#8220;soften the blow&#8221;. The Jerusalem Talmud takes a very harsh stance towards women and their spiritual capabilities and the Torah Temimah doesn&#8217;t think that this is a great message. In classic rabbinic form he reinterprets the statement from the Jerusalem Talmud to make it much more palatable. It&#8217;s not women&#8217;s liberation propaganda. It&#8217;s not going to be in JOFA&#8217;s literature. But it is something. It might be an acknowledgement from a great Torah scholar that taken at face value, this is an offensive statement towards women.</p>
<p>I think that most women would feel more comfortable serving God that does talk to women than a God who does not talk to women. It could be that the Torah Temimah was trying to ensure that women not be led to believe that the simple reading of the Jerusalem Talmud is the only authority on the matter.</p>
<p>Then again, it might just be a commentator trying to reconcile contradictory statements. But I think that every exegete chooses their battles. The fact that the Torah Temimah chose this battle shows me something.</p>
<p>Read the Torah Temimah here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/seferid_14052_page_171.pdf" target="_blank">Toldos</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/seferid_14052_page_239.pdf" target="_blank">Vayera</a></p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Toldos<br />
The Man Makes the Clothes</h2>
<p>As Yaakov Avinu dons the <em>bigdei chamudos </em>of Eisav Harasha the impersonation of his brother is complete. He places goat skins on his neck and hands and enters the chamber of Yitzchok Avinu with the delicacies prepared by his mother. Something else accompanies him, too. As Yitzchok verifies Yaakov’s identity, he tenders a fatherly kiss, and notices a fragrant aroma streaming forth from Yaakov’s wardrobe and gives him a bracha. As he does so, Yitzchok exclaims; <em>“re’eh reiach b’nee kreiach hasadeh asher beracho Hashem</em>.” Chazal explain this to mean that the aroma of Gan Eden emanated from the very clothing Yaakov put on to visit his father.</p>
<p>One cannot help but wonder, why now? What was so unusual?  After all, the <em>bigdei chamudos </em>that Yaakov was wearing were the very same special clothes that Eisav himself wore when he went to serve his father. Didn’t the aroma of Gan Eden accompany them when Eisav wore them, too? Apparently not. Indeed, it is the man that makes the clothes and not vice versa.<span id="more-6477"></span></p>
<p>Chazal teach that Eisav’s <em>bigdei chamudos </em>was really the special cloak that Eisav took from Nimrod. This garment has a long history. It was the same outfit that Hashem Yisborach <em>kivayachol </em>fashioned for Adam and Chava, the k<em>osnos ohr</em>, He used to clothe them after He evicted them from Gan Eden. But if these clothes were given to Adam and Chava after their being thrown out of Gan Eden how do they carry its aroma?</p>
<p>The answer is found in our understanding of that first cloak. Though the posuk spells the word ohr with the letter ayin, meaning leather, the Midrash says, that in the Torah of  Rabbi Meir, the word ohr was written with an alef, meaning light. How are we to understand this Chazal?</p>
<p>Life in Gan Eden before the sin of Adam and Chava was supernatural. Wheat stalks grew from kernels into the finest cakes, right out of the ground! There was no need to further refine its nature. Its spiritual potential and physical essence were the perfect harmonious blend that Hashem Yisborach intended. All that changed after the <em>cheit</em> of Adam Harishon. No longer would the world produce a naturally finished product. Though man could no longer enjoy the instant Kedusha which surrounded him in Gan Eden, all was not lost. Hashem still gave us the opportunity of sanctifying this world. But now we would have to do it on our own. Hashem in his infinite kindness enabled us to recreate the essential Gan Eden experience. With hard work we are able to spiritualize the world gifted to us. We can imbue all we touch with ruchniyus. We can transform the <em>olam hagashmi,</em> symbolized by leather, (<em>ohr</em> with an <em>ayin</em>) into light &#8211; a spiritual luminescence – the <em>ohr</em> with an alef! In so doing we recreate the essence of Gan Eden in our lives today. This is the message of Rabbi Meir.</p>
<p>Indeed, this essence of Gan Eden was mastered by Yaakov Avinu, the <em>ish tam yosheiv ohalim</em>. He with his <em>middah</em> of <em>emes</em> was able to impart all the qualities of His <em>ruchniyus </em>and transform whatever <em>gashmiyus </em>came his way into a <em>cheftza shel kedusha</em>, mastering and harnessing its total spiritual potential. This is the <em>koach</em> that enables Yaakov to produce the 12 <em>shevatim</em>. Approaching Yitzchok Avinu with the <em>mitzvah</em> maximized to its fullest potential, the aroma of Gan Eden was now with him as well. No wonder that Eisav Harasha could never produce that fragrant scent while he wore those clothes. Only a Yaakov Avinu could bring out their <em>kedusha</em> to the fullest. We, his children have that same potential. We can bring the essence of Eden to the world each day. It is our ultimate <em>tachlis</em> and makes Hashem so very proud of all that we, His children, can achieve.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Toldos<br />
A Total Education</h2>
<p>The beginning of Parshas Toldos reintroduces us to the birth of Yitzchak Avinu as it begins to detail his legacy as a second of our avos. The Parsha begins <em>v’eileh toldos Yitzchok ben Avraham, Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. The commentaries wonder what the second half of this pasuk is teaching us since the verse already explained that Avraham was Yitzchok’s father. Rashi quotes the chazal which tells us that <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em> is placed in the verse to teach us that Yitzchok looked exactly like his father and anyone who saw him knew that Avraham holid es Yitzchok, only Avraham can be his father (and not Avimelech, as the cynics of the generation had posited).</p>
<p>The Ibn Ezra takes a different approach. He explains the declaration that <em>Avraham holid es Yizchok</em> is referring to Yitzchok’s chinuch. Having fathered Yishmael, Avraham Avinu knew full well what it was like to have a child at risk. This time he took no chances. Not only did Avraham father Yitzchok but he also reared him to follow his teachings!<span id="more-4879"></span></p>
<p>In the nature versus nurture debate Avraham had discovered that both our needed. He thus faithfully transmitted all his values and priorities to Yitzchok his son. In every way Yitzchok was the physical and spiritual heir to Avraham Avinu. Similarly we are taught <em>kol milamid ben chaveiro kielu yaldo</em>. From the moment he was born, education, Yitzchok’s chinuch was Avraham Avinu’s full time preoccupation. He put all his <em>kochos leholid Yitzchok</em>, to guide, inspire and direct him on the path of greatness. And, with <em>siata dishmaya</em> he was blessed with success.</p>
<p>If we reflect back on nuances of the previous parsha leading up to and following Yitzchok’s birth we can mine some vital gems of chinuch priorities we can apply today. The Meforshim wonder what is the linkage between the destruction of Sedom and the <em>besurah tova</em> to Avraham and Sara that they will be blessed with a son? The three malachim traveled together, obviously there was a connection to their individual missions. Some explain first and foremost that Sedom had to be destroyed before Yitzchok could be born. There would be no way to rear a Yitzchok to the status of a <em>korban olah</em> with a Sedom in the environs. Thus when the malachim told Sara she would have a son they immediately set out to destroy that which could corrupt and derail all that Yitzchok could grow to be.</p>
<p>Avraham and Sarah understood this message and when the time came they exiled Yishmael from their home. A painful choice that with Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s blessing cleared the environment for Yitzchok to thrive. Even with his new beloved son growing up before his eyes, Avraham stuck to his own mission of outreach in kiruv. <em>Vayeeta eishal b’Vear Sheva</em>, and guest filled his home connecting to Hakadosh Baruch Hu (eishal was the acromyn for achila, shtiya velina). In this manner Yitzchok learned his <em>achrayus</em> to the klal and the need to spread the reality of Hashem Yisborach to a lost and pagan world.</p>
<p>Finally, after the <em>akaida</em> (22:19) Ibn Ezra wonders why the pasuk says vayashav Avraham el niarav, it seems that Avraham alone returned. Where was Yitzchok? The Ibn Ezra explains that following the <em>akaida</em>, the climactic moment of <em>gelui shchina</em> and <em>mesiras nefesh</em> when he was almost shechted, Yitzchok reached a tremendous <em>madraiga</em>. Avraham wanted to capitalize on the energy of the moment and therefore sent him to learn in the Yeshiva of Shem V’ever so that he could build on his inspiration and through <em>limud haTorah</em> to soar to even greater heights that would remain with him long after the inspiration had waned. <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. He directed every aspect of his total development, <em>b’gashmius, b’ruchniyus, b’middos, b’mitzvos, b’yiras shamayim ub’limud haTorah</em>.</p>
<p>This message should never be lost upon us. Chinuch must be the full time preoccupation especially in our challenging environment where the elimination of the Sedom’s of our world are simply impossible. As such, we must be even more careful in providing balance between removing corrupting influences from our home (Yishmael) and providing healthy opportunities to see others not committed to our values but who we confidently bring under our sphere of influence without the fear that we will be corrupted by them. As careful as Avraham was with the chinuch of Yitzchok, he did not put his head in the sand nor completely isolate him from the world at large. Finally, we must show our children that Talmud Torah is <em>kineged kulam</em>. It is not enough to be inspired but we must live inspired. Therefore at the moments of great spiritual peeks we must look towards our learning to be the glue that enables us to hold onto that moment and maximize its impact each and every day.</p>
<p>Like Avraham we cannot have a <em>hesech hadaas</em> from the chinuch of our children. We can learn from him. Iy”H as our children grow it will be said of each of us that we were holid each of our offspring.</p>

<h2>Parshas Toldos</h2>
<h2>The Gift of Golus</h2>
<p>One cannot help but be fascinated with the entire episode of Yitzchok Avinu and the brachos intended for Eisav which are surreptitiously taken by Yaakov Avinu. Chazal darshan every nuance of the parsha for yesodos so vital for us today. Chazal wonder (as do we), what was it that Yitzchok Avinu actually intended? What was Rivka’s viewpoint? And what is the lasting lesson?<span id="more-3251"></span></p>
<p>There are many interesting approaches and lessons to be learnt. One insight is derived from an enigmatic Midrash Rabbah which scrutinizes the original instructions given to Eisav. Yitzchok Avinu asks his eldest son, “Sah na keilecha telyicha vkashtecha vtzei hasadeh vtzudah li tzayid – Lift up your gear, your bow and arrow and go out to the field to hunt your prey.” Why is the method of the hunt so important to Yitzchok? Why didn’t Yitzchok Avinu simply request Eisav to bring him dinner? After all, Eisav is the expert hunter.</p>
<p>Chazal explain that a powerful message was being alluded to in Yitzchok’s request of Eisav. We are taught that the eve of this all important Bracha ceremony was leil Pesach and the directives of the posuk symbolically represent the four galuyos. Bavel, Madai, Yavan and Edom. Yitzchok Avinu knew good and well just what Eisav was all about. He wanted to help him. He intended to give him the tools to achieve a complete and total teshuva, the opportunity for spiritual redemption. Similarly, the four goluyos are intended to provide a forced and focused tikun to enable Klal Yisrael to reconnect to the Aibeshter after they err.</p>
<p>We can almost hear Yitzchok Avinu speaking to Eisav with all of his passion, as he implores him. Eisav you have sinned, but you can grow from your mistakes. You can trek from golus to geula if you but seek it as your objective. Stalk the prey of Torah, Tefilla (lasuach basadeh) and teshuva and you can connect to the Ribbon Shel Olam like your brother, Yaakov, the ish tam yoshev ohalim. Sah na keilecha, lift up, elevate and spiritualize your kochos hanfesh, for you have talents that are gifted to you alone. You, too, can be successful and inspire others to do the same. Eisav, this time, as you hunt, leave your special hunting jacket at home. Do not take the easy way out. Go forth through the golus, seek and pursue the emes, you will be rewarded with geula. It is Pesach eve. Is there a moment more ripe for redemption? My dear Eisav, remember, Hashem helps everyone who desires to escape Mitzrayim and their own “mietzarim,” the limitations that bind them to an olam hazehdikeh life. Go forth Eisav, and bring me matamim, the delicacies of a holy lifestyle, of gashmiyus infused and transformed to ruchniyus,  ba’avur tivrechacha nafshi biterem amus so that I may bless you before it too late. Then I can proclaim and you will be worthy of v’iyitein Licha Elokim – Hashem should bless you with all of His, brachos in both Olam Hazeh and Olam Habah!</p>
<p>Rivka Imeinu overhears Yitzchok’s impassioned plea. She realizes that Yaakov, too, desperately needs such a bracha. Not for himself but for us. Sadly, she knows that there will be times when Klal Yisrael will r”l stray. They would need the gift of golus and geula, the power of teshuva to brighten their future. Without it all would be lost. With it, Klal Yisrael would be blessed for eternity.<br />
Rivka readies Yaakov for his masquerade. Dressed up as Eisav, Yaakov quickly arrives with the delicacies prepared by his mother. Yitzchok grows suspicious almost immediately and says mah zeh miharta limtzo b’ni – Eisav my son, how did you accomplish your avodah so quickly?! Is teshuva so easy to achieve? His concern was rapidly allayed as Yaakov responds Ki hikrah Hashem Elokecha – I was gifted Siyata Dishmaya, Hashem Yisborach heard my cry. Indeed we know – pischu li pesach kichudo shel machat vani eftach lach pesach kipischo shel ulom! Yitzchok was satisfied. Indeed, the young man him before was accompanied by the aroma of Gan Eden. The gift of Teshuva, of growth through golus and geula, was now ready to be bestowed upon his son who needed it the most. But thanks to Rivka, it was not Eisav. Instead, it was Yaakov Avinu who in turn gifted to us that precious legacy so that we should be worthy of His blessings.</p>
<p>Yehi Ratzon that we be zocheh to grow from this long golus to the euphoria and clarity of geula. Let us vanquish Eisav and this golus through the koach Hateshuva. V’alu moshi’im b’har Tzion lishpot es har Eisav v’haysa Hashem hamlucha. bimahra biyameinu Amen.</p>

<h1>Yaakov, Eisav &amp; The Simple Things in Life</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">This week’s parsha presents the fundamental distinction between Klal Yisrael and the Umos HaOlam, defined by Yaakov Avinu and Eisav Harasha. Exploring these differences can help us understand what defines us and which values to seek and transmit to our children. One insight is especially relevant to the contemporary milieu.<span id="more-1703"></span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Yaakov buys the Bichorah, the birthright, from Eisav for a bowl of soup. Upon receipt of such we are told—Vayochal, Vayeisht, Vayakom, Vayeilach, Vayivez: he ate, drank, got up, left and mocked. The mifarshim derive powerful messages from his behavior. The Kli Yakar notes that this phrase is the makor for the medrash that says Eisav committed 5 serious Aveiros on that day replete with heretical, immoral and antisocial behavior.</p>
<p>On a simpler level, however, one can come to understand from this phrase the superficiality of an Eisav which is mirrored by American life today. Eisav was constantly on the run: fast food, quick drink and a “get up and go”, instant, disposable lifestyle was all he made time for. There was no desire or effort to stop and smell the roses and appreciate what was truly his. Relationships were temporary and insights superficial. Even the gift of life grew tired. As a result he did not thoroughly deliberate his mission in life or his connection to Hashem. He became cynical and scorned the Bechora, his spiritual birthright. Torah and Mitzvos became a burden to be unloaded rather than a joy to be celebrated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these attitudes can creep into the contemporary Torah home. We expect instant gratification and wish for automatic success–effortlessly and with instant messaging! We get wrapped up in the here and now and anticipate immediate results with our children’s education, shalom Bayis and professional ambitions. Klal Yisrael should know better. When it comes to growing in Torah, Mitzvos, and personal development, the Gemarah tells us, “Yagatah Umatzasa Ta’amin”, if one labors and achieves, that is believable.</p>
<p>Yaakov Avinu personifies such growth. He was an “Ish Tam Yoshev Ohalim-a pure man who sat in the tent”, constantly pondering, deliberating and striving to serve Hashem with his entire being and as a result he achieved. It is this model that fuels the formation of the quintessential Jewish family, the 12 shevatim. His success yielded true lasting Simcha, the joy of accomplishment. That is the true Simchas Hachayim that we should all strive for and  IY”H receive.</p>
