<p>We got plenty of customers who appreciated the reminder that Rosh Hashana was around the corner. Many also appreciated stippling into our historic shul for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Everyone was also invite to join us for services to hear the Shofar blasts and experience some of our High Holiday traditions and services. Hopefully some will take us up on the offer&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/200573745-001.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2804" title="200573745-001" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/200573745-001.jpg?resize=200%2C240" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>As we approach the Jewish New Year there is an effort  to at least attempt to enter Rosh Hashanah clean from sin. Unfortunately, we have made bad choices, we have done wrong in our lives. How are we to start a fresh year with joy and confidence if we are carrying all the baggage of mistakes we have made. It can be depressing thinking about bad choices we have made. They all have consequences and we may regret what we have done. But regret does not fix the harms we have caused. Regret can have a debilitating effect if it holds us back from achieving our goals as we wallow in self pity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a concept of Teshuva, repentance, in Judaism. The word repentance generally refers to a person to has decided to commit their life to God (see Wikipedia on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance" target="_blank">repentance</a>). But what of someone who already has committed their life to God and is trying to do their best to make the best moral choices in their life but has made mistakes? Is there a mechanism for that person to somehow come back to God? Aren&#8217;t they already committed to God? What more can they do?</p>
<p>In Judaism there is such a mechanism. <span id="more-2801"></span>That is what we call Teshuva. Anyone can do teshuva and everyone should be doing teshuva all the time. Any time we make the wrong choice we have created separation between ourselves and God who is Perfection. Our lack of perfection stands in the way of being with God and Perfection. The further we are from perfection, the further we are from God. Teshuva gets us closer to perfection.</p>
<p>But how? Once we have acted and done wrong the deed is done. Can teshuva make it disappear? Is it magic?</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is the idea that God is the Ultimate Judge. That means that if an act is &#8220;bad&#8221; it deserves immediate consequences. There is no judge, no jury, no lawyers, no plea bargain deals, Ultimate Judgment means that every act has an exact and precise Divine Reaction. That is how the physical world works as well. If ones steals something, the item is stolen immediately. There is no grace period or gray area. If one kills someone, the person is dead. If one cheats on their wife, they have cheated. In the physical world, our actions have immediate, real reactions. That is what is meant by &#8220;judgment&#8221; (poor translation of the hebrew word din). There is an immediate reaction to our actions from God as well. The distance created by our lack of perfection is instantaneous. How do we repent from acts that are done? If someone is dead because of our action, no amount of sorrow or regret will bring the person back. Same with infidelity. How can teshuva fix the immediate reactions of our actions?</p>
<p>This leaves us with an additional question: While it is true that God acts with judgment, God also acts with mercy (rachamim) how does mercy reconcile with judgment if judgment means that every action has an immediate physical and spiritual reaction?</p>
<p>The Ramchal in Mesillas Yesharim provides a wonderful explanation. First, he explains that the mercy of God is that while every action does have an immediate spiritual consequence, that consequence can be suspended for a period of time giving the person time to repent.</p>
<p>But what of the repentance? How does that work? He says that every action really has two parts. The first part is the formation of intent. The idea and the desire to act are the first part of every action. Then we act; that is the second part. The action causes the immediate result. Physical and spiritual. Each action is &#8220;owned&#8221; by its actor. So when one makes a wrong choice the act is connected to them. The action is the end of a chain that hooks up to the actor. The hook on the end of the chain that is connected to the actor is the desire for the result. So a flow chart would look like this:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Actor&#8212;-&gt;Desire&#8212;-&gt;Action&#8212;-&gt;Result.</h3>
<p>The result is only connected to the actor through the desire. Teshuva is the process of &#8220;undoing&#8221; the desire for the action and its result. True repentance occurs when the actor wishes with all their heart that they had never acted the way they did. When the person truly regrets their choice the desire part of the action can be unhooked from the actor! If there is no hook connectig the action to the actor (the desire) then the actor and the action are no longer associated with one another. That is teshuva. Repentance is disassociating the action from the actor by removing the desire to act. Of course, in order for the desire to be disassociated from the actor the actor must everything in their power to fix the horrible results of their action. But once that is done, repentance can be achieved and the action can be clipped away from the actor.</p>
<p>Certainly, the deed is done. What&#8217;s done is done. We cannot change the past. But we can change our association with the past.</p>
<p>This kind of repentance leaves no room for baggage and guilt. It is a clean break from the past and allows us to move forward to a future of better choices.</p>
<p>It is the perfect way to begin a new year.</p>

Folks are generally more friendly and generous under the &#8220;guise&#8221; of Holiday Spirit.</p>
<p>Seeing as Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) is a mere 9 days away, if we were Christian and the New Year was 9 days away, we would be knee-deep in the &#8220;Holiday Spirit&#8221;. A congregant of mine told me an anecdote that would fit neatly in the &#8220;Holiday Spirit&#8221; if we had an equivalent.<span id="more-2769"></span></p>
<p>This fellow was shopping at the local butcher (Western Kosher) and he noticed an orthodox Jewish woman had stacked her yogurt on top of her chicken. Now, most orthodox Jews don&#8217;t think twice about that kind of move, but there are some people who are new to religious Judaism who prefer to keep their milk and meat products separate in their shopping carts. (No, there is no reason to do this, it just happens that fellow in the story does separate his meat and milk in his shopping cart.) So the fellow thinks about saying something to the nice lady but thought it was a silly thing to bring to her attention because he realized that there is nothing wrong with stacking cold yogurt in a package on top on cold chicken in a package.</p>
<p>By now, she had caught his attention and he noticed that she was holding a list with at least 8 or 9 items. Her overhears that woman say to the manager &#8220;Please put $1000 in the Schwartz* account. $1000 in the Goldberg account. $1000 in the Cohen account.&#8221; and so she went for a few minutes, quite simply crediting at least 8 or 9 families with $1000 out of her own pocket. This fellow was witnessing a true act of charity. Charity given in the most respectful way with no begging, handouts or embarrassment. An estimated $10,000 went to the less fortunate of Los Angeles last week from this woman alone.</p>
<p>That is a universal Holiday Spirit.</p>
<p>*names changed (duh)</p>

<p>Sometimes I see video on YouTube that I cannot help but share with you.</p>
<p>This 13 second gem was sent to me by a friend.</p>
<p>It appeals to my sense of humor. It actually made me laugh. Background story below&#8230;</p>
<p>Enjoy.<span id="more-2742"></span></p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EkrgsCHc_Ns?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EkrgsCHc_Ns?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>My friend was in crazy traffic (not crazy like the 3 month backup in China) and he had his tallis and shofar in the car and his friend had a camera. They were passing an Ikea and my friend chuckles to himself Ikeaaaa (sounds like Tekiaaaah) and the video was born&#8230;</p>
<p>(Further explanation: The shofar makes three sounds. One is called tekia. On Rosh Hashana someone calls out each shofar blast before it is blown. So before tekia he chants &#8220;tekiaaa&#8221;.)</p>

The services were inspiring, the attendance was excellent and the mood properly reflected the importance of the days.</p>
<p>I spoke from the pulpit several times over the holiday.</p>
<p>There was certainly an over-arching theme to my sermons. Each had its own individual message but overall they reflected an idea that I feel is central to Rosh Hashana, judgment, repentance, Judaism and Humanity.</p>
<p>It is too easy to get  caught up in ourselves. We hope for a good verdict, we try to be the best people we can be as individuals.</p>
<p>For me, the greater challenge is fitting in the group. Every time I spoke over the Holiday, the underlying theme was Unity.<span id="more-1224"></span>Each person really has three identities.</p>
<p>One is our own personal accomplishments. Everything that one does in their life goes into this category and those things have value on their own. We look at the person in a vacuum and assess their achievements as an individual. Everyone has unique talents and abilities that make then who they are.</p>
<p>The second identity is the person&#8217;s group. Everyone is part of various groups. Whether by religion, race, political party, trade or family we all belong to groups. Those groups form a part of our identity. But each group member&#8217;s individual role is not relevant. The group has an identity and by association with that group, that identity becomes the identity of everyone in the group.</p>
<p>The third identity is the most important. It is the combination of number 1 and number 2. It is how we interact with the group using our individual talents and abilities. This identity is the meeting point of the indidual and the group. If the individual is selfish and uses their talents and abilities for their own personal gain and ignores the group, the person has failed in this identity. But if the person is able to part if the group and use their individualism to elevate the group, then in turn, they elevate themselves.</p>
<p>No where is this third identity clearer to the observer than in competitive team sports. The individual performer has his or her own talents and abilities. What separates the great ones from the rest, is their ability  to use those skills and elevate the team.</p>
<p>It is no different in real life. We all have skills and we are all part of groups. We need to use those skills to elevate our groups, not just ourselves.</p>
<p>It was particularly appropriate to find a <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/6975/more-than-a-game-preview" target="_blank">short post on the NBA Truehoop Blog about this issue today</a>.</p>
<p>LeBron James has a new movie. It is supposed to be about teamwork, but as Truehoop so eloquently puts it, the preview completely fails in this regard.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The bummer about it, however, is that the movie is all about teamwork, but the undeniable message of the preview&#8217;s format (James, shooting alone in a gym) is that celebrity trumps all.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Watch the preview below and you will see just what they mean.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="325" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="325" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Good imagery for the wrong message. We need to be team players in sports and more importantly in life.</p>

Part of a (hopefully) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></strong></p>
<h1>I Think I Can</h1>
<p>With the Yamim Noraim upon us, our thoughts and deeds turn to preparations for the yemei hadin. This is the season of “Dirshu Hashem bihimatzo.” We seek to reconnect to the Ribbono Shel Olam, Who lovingly awaits us kaviyachol with open arms.</p>
<p>Indeed, He gifted us the mitzvah of teshuva so that we could return to Him with love. It is a priceless gift. However, looking back over a year past the task seems daunting.</p>
<p>Can we really recall our every action? Can we justify our every endeavor from Rosh Hashannah past till present? How do we rectify our mistakes? Where do we begin? Last week&#8217;s Torah portion, Parshas Nitzavim offers a clue.<span id="more-1216"></span></p>
<p>The Torah describes the great chesed of Hashem Yisborach, for making the mitzvah of teshuva so easy. We are taught lo bashamayim hee lamor mi yaaleh lanu hashamyima. The mitzvah of teshuva is not a distant, far away concept far off in the sky that we require a leader to ascend to the heavens and show us the way. Rather, bificha ubilvavcha lasoso — it is in your reach and very near to you; it is in your mouth and your heart to achieve.</p>
<p>Our Rabbis marvel at this unusual expression. It seems to be backward. Shouldn’t Teshuva first begin in the heart and then be expressed by one&#8217;s lips? Don’t we have to first feel before we make commitments to change. Why is it reversed? They explain: the most difficult part of the Teshuva process is getting started. Before we begin, we must generate the self confidence that we can truly be better and improve. We must encourage ourselves to take those first few steps down the path of Teshuva. Like the little engine that could, we must tell ourselves, “I think I can—I think can.” In fact, teshuva is not as much about result as it is about effort.</p>
<p>The Rambam in Hilchos Teshuva explains to us how we all have free choice to choose right or r”l wrong. He then states (Hilchos Teshuva 7:1) Ho’eil urishus kol adam nisuna lo k’mo shbearnu yishtadel adam la’asos teshuva &#8211; since each person has free choice as we explained each individual should try and do teshuva. The mifarshei HaRambam wonder, if we all have choice then we must do teshuva. Why does the Rambam insert the word “try” into his exhortation that we all repent? Is just trying enough? The answer is absolutely, yes! Teshuva is all about in the effort. Too often, people give up even before they start. They think that change is too difficult or too late. The Rambam’s message and that of thr parsha—if we just try, one step at a time, we can succeed. B’phicha ubilvavcha la’asoso — tell yourself you can and iy”H you will. L’shana tova tikaseiv v’seichaseim.</p>

<p><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">This Post Has Been Cross Posted to </span><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/09/twitter-your-prayers.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">DovBear.</span></a></em></strong></p>
<p>The morning before Rosh Hashana there is a custom to recite extended Slichos in Shul.</p>
<p>Led by Gary Dalin, the services this morning were wonderful. Thank you Gary.</p>
<p>The Slichos are mostly Medieval era poetry designed to arouse the soul within to make amends for all wrongs committed during the year. As we approach the judgment of Rosh Hashana we bolster our efforts in securing a good verdict with the extra Slichos.</p>
<p>As the Slichos are written using a complex, poetic formula it is necessary to use a prayer book with translated versions of the Slichos to help us understand what we are reading in the original Hebrew.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the translations are nearly as difficult to understand as the original. There was one very familiar word found in Slicha #38.<span id="more-1204"></span></p>
<p>After Slichos this morning, Alan Danziger pointed out this little gem to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1203" title="Twitter" src="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Twitter2.jpg?resize=640%2C355" alt="Twitter" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Artscroll Slichos 389)</p>
<p>It seems that the Paytan (composer of the Selicha) was either on <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a> sometime before 1234 CE or was prophesizing ~800 into the future.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, Prayer can be effective through any medium. Whether you pray in your heart, with your lips, in print or digitally, the main thing is to be sincere and to use Prayer as a tool for developing a deeper relationship with God.</p>
<p>It is clear that from the Rosh Hashana liturgy that a primary task of Rosh Hashana is to anoint and accept God as our King. We use the Shofar and our Prayers to accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>There is a Mechilta in Yisro that says that gratitude for what God has done for us is the key to open the door for those feelings to penetrate and enable us to make God our King of our lives. Think about all the wonderful things that we have in life. Appreciate them and use those emotions to propel you to proclaim God as our King.</p>
<p>May we all merit to see the day that God&#8217;s dominion is clear to all.</p>
<p>Gmar Chasima Tova to each and every one of you.</p>

<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/17/kim-clijsters-tennis-champion-and-mother/" target="_blank">Earlier today I posted about Kim Clijsters and the sacrifices of working mothers</a>.</p>
<p>It must be the impending Rosh Hashana that is influencing these thoughts of parents and children.</p>
<p>Parenting is tough job. There are no vacations. There is no financial remuneration. It is oftentimes thankless.</p>
<p>Also we are so clueless as to how to parent. Babies don&#8217;t come with a handy manual or set of instructions. The questions all parents have are endless.<span id="more-1185"></span></p>
<p>To punish or not? When to compliment? To be honest with our children about their shortcomings? I always think about Simon Cowell asking some terrible &#8220;singer&#8221; if anyone ever told them that they are just not talented. And then they cut to that parents telling their kid how great they are. No one wants to be that parent.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/health/15mind.html?em" target="_blank">very popular article in the NY Times about parenting this week</a>. The article explains, based on a study by 2 Israeli researchers, that conditional love can be just as harmful to children as punishment. Meaning, when a parent only doles out love for their child when the child performs as the parent expects the affect on the child is the same as punishing the child when the parent disapproves of the child&#8217;s behavior. The child may accomplish more, but will ultimately feel resentment, anxiety and feel unhappy.</p>
<p>The proper way to love one&#8217;s children is unconditionally.</p>
<p>Love is not a tool that we wield to bend the child into submission. Every child needs the love of its parents. Always.</p>
<p>This is a message we can take into Rosh Hashana. It is true that it is a day of judgment and that can give us reason to pause and be fearful of our verdict. There is a Judge and there is judgment.</p>
<p>We have one saving grace. The Judge is our Father.</p>
<p>The relationship that we have with God is the same as the relationship that a parent has with a child. Unconditional love.</p>
<p>When it comes to our moment of judgment in the heavenly court we know that we are unconditionally loved by our Father in Heaven no matter how far we may strayed from His path. Just remember that our Father is waiting for us with a warm embrace.</p>
<p>Children that feel unconditionally loved have less problems feeling accepted later in life. Unconditional love is the greatest gift a parent can provide for their children. Sometimes it may seem hard when children frustrate us.</p>
<p>A great video has been circling the internet the last couple of days.</p>
<p>The video really illustrates what I have been saying in this post. Even when our children frustrate us, we must love them unconditionally. Even if we &#8220;frustrate&#8221; God, He has a warm embrace for us. He is our father.</p>
<p>The father in this video looks like he is about to get frustrated with his daughter. Then he embraces her.</p>
<p>Perfect imagery for this post. Enjoy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1187" title="Kim Clijsters" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Kim-Clijsters-carries-dau-0021.jpg?resize=300%2C221" alt="Kim Clijsters" data-recalc-dims="1" />Something has been on mind the last few days. The last three blog posts I have attempted to write have been all on the same topic. I have decided to turn them into two blog posts and this is the first of a two part series.</p>
<p>The topic is parenting. The relationship between parents and their children.</p>
<p>It is a timely subject as the Jewish Calendar turns the page into a new year. A major element of the Rosh Hashana liturgy is the relationship between us and God. That relationship takes a few forms. One form is that of a parent to a child.</p>
<p><span id="more-1183"></span></p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen09/news/story?id=4471433" target="_blank">Kim Clijsters won the US Open</a>. The US Open is a Tennis Tournament featuring the greatest players in the world. Clijsters was a dominant tennis player a few years ago and then she took a break to have a baby. She had the baby and two and a half years later came back to competitive tennis. Her first major tournament in her comeback was the US Open. And she won.</p>
<p>What struck me is the media&#8217;s attention to the fact that she was a mother and yet somehow was able beat the odds and win the US Open. I think that is noteworthy because parents have different priorities than non-parents. Parents put their kids first and their lives second. That Clijsters could be a mother whose primary concern was her child and still had enough in the tank to train and compete and win is very impressive.</p>
<p>Clijsters demonstrated the true strength of being a woman. She demonstrated the ability to have her cake and eat it too. Clijsters is at the top of her professional world and is also a relatively new mother. Congratulations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I just can&#8217;t help but wonder how all this affects her child.</p>
<p>Is there a cost? Does her child miss her mother when she spends long hours training? Should a mother of a young child be spending more time with her child?</p>
<p>I think it is great that women have opportunities for success. I really do.</p>
<p>But what about the child? What if the father is also working a tough, time consuming job?</p>
<p>Who raises the children?</p>
<p>I know that this question is broader than Kim Clijsters winning the US Open. But the media attention surroounding her success and motherhood got me thinking.</p>
<p>What is the feminist approach to this issue? How are parenting duties divided when both parents work? Does it even matter? Or are children just as well off being raised by paid surrogates?</p>
