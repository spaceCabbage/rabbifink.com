They protested Judaism last week in Brooklyn and they have a case in front of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>I have been asked for predictions and my opinion on the issue.</p>
<p>Luckily, I wrote this paper for a Hate Speech Seminar I took at Loyola Law School in the Summer of 2010. There is some important legal background, a quasi-prediction and alternative suggestion for the future in there. (I was given permission to post the article by my professor.)</p>
<p>I hope you will take the time to read it, think it over and share your thoughts with me.</p>
<p>I try to avoid legalese, but if there is something in there that needs explanation please leave a comment so I can explain it to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>Enjoy.<span id="more-3099"></span></p>
<p>(I also recommend watching the excellent documentary on the WBC which follows the paper.)</p>

<p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger is quitting the over-the-air radio business. She has been forced into a corner with no apparent way out. Her resigning was demanded in the wake of her comments to a caller in which she used racial slurs to illustrate a point.</p>
<p>I am not defending Dr. Laura&#8217;s use of insensitive language, however I do not think she should quit or be asked / forced to quit.</p>
<p>Here is exactly what happened: (<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/In-Defense-of-Dr-Laura-4741" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>A black woman called the show and told Dr. Laura that</p>
<blockquote><p>her husband is white and his relatives frequently use hurtful racial language around her, including the &#8220;N-word.&#8221; In response, Schlessinger said &#8220;Black guys use it all the time. Turn on HBO, listen to a black comic, and all you hear is n*****, n*****, n*****.&#8221; Schlessinger also told her that &#8220;If you&#8217;re that hypersensitive about color and don&#8217;t have a sense of humor, don&#8217;t marry out of your race.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Predictably, there was a lot of backlash and Dr. Laura was forced to quit.<span id="more-2727"></span></p>
<p>The Dr. Laura flap reminded me of the Helen Thomas fiasco. Thomas was also forced to resign in the wake of her insensitive comments as well.</p>
<p>Thomas said something to effect of:</p>
<blockquote><p>Israelis should &#8220;get the hell out of Palestine&#8221; and &#8220;go home&#8221; to Germany and Poland.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas took the heat for a few days until she quit.</p>
<p>I think these stories are both tragic.</p>
<p>Yes, in both cases, the comments were insensitive. Would they like to take back their words if they could? Sure. So why don&#8217;t we let them?</p>
<p>Both of these women speak millions of words over the course of their careers. It is inevitable that they will slip up. Why are we so swift to demand they give up their careers? Have we become so sensitive that there is no longer forgiveness?</p>
<p>It goes to a deeper issue as well.</p>
<p>The distillation of thought and narrowing of acceptable speech severely hampers the ability for Americans to debate and discuss issues. The 1st Amendment protects our right to free speech. This right has been described as providing a marketplace of ideas. If we allow whoever yells loudest to bully the marketplace then the marketplace becomes dominated by that voice.</p>
<p>The proper response to speech that you find offensive is not deprive the speaker from speaking further.* It is by explaining why the speech is offensive and offering counter-speech. Discussion and debate. Not calls for resigning.</p>
<p>By allowing bullies to determine who is permitted in the marketplace if ideas and who is not permitted in the marketplace of ideas curtails the effectiveness of that marketplace.</p>
<p>Dr. Laura and Helen Thomas were important voices. They may be infuriating at times and they may have been insensitive. But that is not a reason for their voices to be lost. The marketplace of ideas has fewer voices and that hurts us.</p>
<p>The real losers in their resignations is us.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">*Severe forms of hate speech that are likely to incite violence or compromise the rights of others are not protected by the 1st Amendment.</span></em></p>

(<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/06/13/mr-miller-was-my-math-teacher-at-ner-israel/">Mr. Miller Was My Math Teacher at Ner Israel</a>) I went to a pretty well known yeshiva high school but this kind of media exposure for Ner Israel is not too common. Of course I was proud so I told my sister to check out the video and article.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, my sister told me that her high school was also famous!</p>
<p>It seems that WNET, the New York PBS affiliate, has a segment called &#8220;Religion and Ethics. A few weeks back they did a piece on hateful gossip in schools. With the advent of the internet and specifically sites like Facebook, it has become so easy to say nasty things about others and leave a permanent record of the comments.<span id="more-2562"></span></p>
<p>Cyber Abuse is what they call it. Saying things that are not nice on the internet about someone else can have a much more drastic and long term effect on the subject. Perhaps even worse than originally intended. The internet is a danger zone!</p>
<p>They talk a little bit about JuicyCampus which was one of the first and one of the most prolific sites for College students slander and gossip. It got shut down eventually and there is a new movement in its stead to try and promote good manners and ethics on the internet and limit evil speech about others.</p>
<p>The piece then moves from the extremely dangerous internet world of anonymous speech that could harm people&#8217;s lives to Manhattan High School for Girls. MHS is a Bais Yaakov style girl&#8217;s high school in Manhattan. My sisters attended MHS and I have heard really great things about the school. It might be the 2nd best girls high school in the world. Obviously the best is my father&#8217;s school, Ateres Bais Yaakov in Monsey.</p>
<p>At MHS, the girls learn about the harms of Lashon Hara (evil speech), work together to prevent and stop evil speech and care passionately about avoiding Lashon Hara. This is a stark contrast to the world of gossip that exists at high schools and Universities across the U.S.A. and has spawned shows like Gossip Girl.</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when it is permissible, in fact, even obligatory to say negative things about another person. The idea is to learn when and how to implement those exceptions. The best thing about a conscious effort to avoid speaking Lashon Hara is how it affects the way you speak by making you consider the value of your speech. Is it something that must be said? Or is it something better left unsaid?</p>
<p>The girls that are interviewed are very candid and perform very well in front of the camera. The message of the video is that we can all learn from MHS and the Jewish approach to Lashon Hara. I can only reiterate what a great message that is and congratulate MHS for truly being a light unto the nations.</p>
