				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mitt-romney-sad.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6441" title="mitt-romney-sad" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mitt-romney-sad-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a>President Barack Obama won his bid for reelection this week. Many people were very extremely emotionally invested in the outcome of the vote.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s greatest supporters wiped tears of joy from their eyes as the president addressed the nation in his victory speech. Mitt Romney&#8217;s greatest supporters were also drying their tears as they were informed of the results (captured in spectacular modern form on this Tumblr: <a href="http://whitepeoplemourningromney.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Whitepeoplemourningromney</a>).</p>
<p>In the old days, when your candidate lost, you grumbled at home, maybe made some comments around the water cooler at work, or maybe even penned an Op-Ed. But in 2012, when your candidate loses, the opportunities to publicly grieve are so much greater. Conservatives (and liberals would have done the same thing if Romney had won) took to social media expressing their distaste for the election results.</p>
<p>This means three things.<span id="more-6440"></span></p>
<p>First, it means that people have an opportunity to vent, be heard, and create a conversation about the election in a public place. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>Second, it means that people can make one another hysterical with exaggerations, myths, or pure fabrications. Since anyone can write anything they want, misinformation can spread rather easily. Especially, when people are in a state of grief, they are particularly susceptible to hyperbole and over-dramatics.</p>
<p>Third, it means that people in a compromised state can say or do things that they will regret. But they are doing them publicly. This can make things awkward when they cool off.</p>
<p>I think that we need a little bit of advice on dealing with disappointment and grief. Fortunately, this week&#8217;s parsha is Chayei Sarah &#8211; the parsha where we learn about grief. Granted, Avraham was grieving for his beloved wife, but I am pretty sure some people loved Romney more than they loved their spouses, or at the very least, hate Obama enough to make it an apt comparison.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that Sarah died and Avraham came to eulogize her and to cry for her. The next verse says that <em>&#8220;Avraham rose up from the presence of his deceased.</em>&#8221; (Genesis 23:3) Then Avraham went to negotiate a burial place for Sarah. The commentaries are bothered by the strange usage in verse 3. Why does the Torah say that Avraham &#8220;rose up&#8221;?</p>
<p>I once heard from Reb Yeruchem Levovitz that the Torah is telling us an important lesson in grief. So long as Avraham was grieving for his wife in private, it was acceptable, even laudable, Â for his emotions to be on his sleeve. But once he began dealing with outsiders in a potential business deal, Avraham had to leave those public emotions behind. Avraham had to &#8220;rise up&#8221; from his mood of public grief and put on his game face so that he could deal with the realities of life. Outward displays of grief have a way of weighing on others and making interactions uncomfortable for other people.</p>
<p>Avraham was in complete control of his emotions and when it was time to face the world, he kept his emotions in check.</p>
<p>I think this is great advice for mourning conservatives. I empathize with people who feel terrible about the election. But I do not empathize with YouTube screeds, public plans to move to Australia, fear mongering, sore loser complaints, or any other anti-social reaction to the election. I think we all have a responsibility to act civilly toward each other whether we win or we lose, whether we are elated or depressed.</p>
<p>To be fair, I think this applies equally to public displays of schadenfreude. But I have seen far less of that than I have seen meltdowns.</p>
<p>My last piece of advice is not to become too emotionally invested in things that are out of one&#8217;s control. Politics and sports are two areas where people place a tremendous amount of emotional energy. We are setting ourselves up for disappointment if we expect to win every time. We won&#8217;t. Reasonable people will disagree. Your political opponents are not (all) idiots. There&#8217;s enough room for an amalgamation of conservative and liberal views in our political system.</p>
<p>I chuckled at liberals who mourned in 2004 when Bush won his second term and I chuckle today when conservatives proclaim Obama&#8217;s reelection the end of America.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s learn the lesson of Avraham&#8217;s mourning. Pull yourself together and carry on with making a difference in the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nate-silver-hed-2012.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6433" title="nate-silver-hed-2012" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nate-silver-hed-2012-300x168.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>The election is over. Just over half of the country is happy with the results of the election. Just under half of the country is disappointed with the results of the election. No matter who won, some people would be happy and others would be sad. That&#8217;s just the reality of politics in America today.</p>
<p>However, there is one aspect of the election that should make everyone happy. By everyone, I mean whether you were rooting for Obama or Romney, you have the right to celebrate something.</p>
<p>Everyone should be celebrating with Nate Silver and <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight</a>.</p>
<p>To recap: Nate Silver confidently projected the outcome of the election nearly perfectly. This is not the first time he has done this. Silver has been blisteringly accurate in the two elections he has predicted. He came to politics by route of math and statistics, not policy and analysis. He was perfect last night as well.</p>
<p>While I am thrilled for Silver because he vindicated himself against the doubters (and the homophobes), I think his victory is a victory for all of us.<span id="more-6432"></span></p>
<p>Silver got his start in analyzing baseball statistics using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics" target="_blank">sabermetrics</a>. He sold his model to the premier sabermetrics website and then moved to politics. His methodologies leave very little room for chance and are based on hard mathematical analysis. Silver removes subjectivity and does not rely on logical fallacies in his projections. This is despite entrenched ideas and established trends in analysis. People don&#8217;t like him because he seems like a magician. He somehow knows what will happen without tapping into the usual prediction patterns and totems. This is why pundits could not understand Silver&#8217;s projections. They are speaking a different language. The old media is using grunts and hand motions, while Silver is speaking the Queen&#8217;s English. They didn&#8217;t even realize that Silver was not making <em>predictions</em>, he was issuing <em>projections</em>.</p>
<p>By analogy, baseball has long been a sport which can be predicted with incredible accuracy using statistics. This methodology is known at sabermetrics. It was the cornerstone of the the now-famous Moneyball system of Billy Beane. The idea is that some advanced statistics are more valuable than the &#8220;eye-test&#8221; or traditional statistics like RBI or even batting average. Finding players who produce good advanced statistics but do not produce good traditional statistics and getting those players for cheaper salaries because they are undervalued in the cornerstone of Moneyball. For many years, traditionalists have resisted sabermetrics. They don&#8217;t understand the math. They are jocks, not nerds. But slowly, advanced statistics are going mainstream. We are seeing more baseball people relying on good data as opposed to outdated and less valuable information.</p>
<p>With Silver&#8217;s incredible projections, it is clear that advanced statistics are going mainstream. This is a good thing for all of us. It means breaking down our biases and tendencies to see things the same old way and using math to see things more accurately. It will help society, a lot.</p>
<p>We need to rely less on accepted wisdom and more on science and math.</p>
<p>One correlation that I have seen is that skeptics who challenge conventional wisdom using science and math also exist in religious environment. These people don&#8217;t want to settle for fallacious arguments or accepted norms just because they are accepted norms. This manifests itself in orthodox Judaism with Daas Torah and people who challenge Daas Torah. The Nate Silvers of the world don&#8217;t accept arguments because of Appeal to Authority. The argument needs to stand on its own merits. It can be debated whether this is good for orthodox Jews or bad for orthodox Jews. However, I think it is clear that with the advent of sabertmetrics and fiverthirtyeight style projections that fewer people will be willing to submit themselves to an ephemeral concept like Daas Torah.</p>
<p>As always this leaves us with a choice. Do we double down on Daas Torah? Do we adjust Daas Torah and its expectations? Do we shutter Daas Torah?</p>
<p>Whichever we choose, let us hope that it is the right choice for the sake of truth and God.</p>
