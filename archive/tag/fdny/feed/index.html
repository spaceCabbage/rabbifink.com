<p>9/11/01</p>
<p>Much has changed in the world since then and much has changed in my life. I got married. I have two sons. I am a Rabbi. I am a Law Student. I am a blogger.</p>
<p>For me, 9/11 was a signpost along the way. My last few months of bachelorhood were marked by the aftermath of 9/11.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to that day.<span id="more-1143"></span></p>
<p>I had the flu and was stuck in bed. I got up late and hobbled to the bathroom. Some guy says to me &#8220;they got the second tower&#8221;, I had no idea what he was talking about. I overheard someone say to turn on the radio. When I turned on the radio my heart dropped.</p>
<p>For my friends and I, studying at Yeshiva of Far Rockaway, we were so close to Ground Zero we could see smoke from our dorm.</p>
<p>The pain of the thousands of victims was felt by an entire nation. We connected with each other in a way that only war can unite people. We were united by a common enemy but we picked each other up in every way possible. It went beyond 9/11 and it became about being human. Eventually, humans will cease to get along, but it sure was nice while it lasted.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most emotional part of the entire 9/11 attack and recovery was the camaraderie that it created. I know that I feel a similar camaraderie when I visit Israel. I know everyone there is family. My brothers and sisters surround me when I go to Israel. Post 9/11 New York felt very much the same.</p>
<p>Around that time the band U2 had made a comeback. Their mid to late 90&#8242;s albums all flopped. They returned to their roots with &#8220;All That You Can&#8217;t Leave Behind&#8221; in October 2000. The album had astronomic appeal and was just as popular in September 2001 as it was when it was released a year earlier. The feel of the album was soulful, inspirational rock. It worked.</p>
<p>In October of 2001 U2 had a concert in Madison Square Garden. When u2 sang their Grammy winning song &#8220;Walk On&#8221; they pulled off the most powerful moment I have ever seen on video. The song message is to move on from pain and hurt and to take the lessons of tragedy and difficulty and use them to make our lives better. To &#8220;Walk On&#8221;. With names of all the victims scrolling in the background, U2 called a contingency of NYC Firefighters onto the stage for a heroes welcome.</p>
<p>I am not 100% certain why, but the video makes me cry every time and even as I type this blog post my eyes fill with tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps you will feel the same way. (The first 4:30 is the song, and the FDNY comes on towards the end). Thanks to Bill Simmons aka The Sports Guy for <a href="http://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/3914950307" target="_blank">tweeting the link</a> to this video.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">I would like to personally thanks those heroes who saved lives and my thoughts are with all those who lost friends and family on that tragic day 8 years ago.</p>
