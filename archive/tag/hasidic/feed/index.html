				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I spoke with a Satmar chasid who studies academic Biblical Scholarship. We talked for a while and I got a sense of his typical chasidic upbringing, his current life situation, and his scholarship activity.</p>
<p>Like almost everyone raised in a deeply insular chasidic environment, he speaks English as a second language. HIs accent is not as thick as some of the other chasidic people I know, but it&#8217;s clear that Yiddish is his first language. However, once I got past the accent, it was also very clear that this was an extremely bright and erudite young man.</p>
<p>I talk to people all the time. Some are smarter than others. Some people have quicker minds than others. This fellow was smart, no question about it.<span id="more-7818"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://thetorah.com/satmar-hasid-and-a-bible-critic/" target="_blank">He wrote a superb article</a> describing his journey into Bible Scholarship and the various ways it has adjusting his thinking and Jewish experience. It was beautifully written and made its points eloquently and somewhat poetically. I was asked to vouch for his chasidic bona fides, which I did, based on a mutual friend and my assessment following our conversation. (Verifying that the fellow exists and lives in the Chasidic community is not an endorsement or approval of the content of his article.)<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cityside060501_560-600x396.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7819" alt="cityside060501_560-600x396" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cityside060501_560-600x396.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The article generated a bit of a firestorm. Not because of its provocative content though. The largest issue seemed to be that people could not believe that a chasid could write such an amazing article. Turns out, the article was too good. It was suggested (accused?) that the chasid had written some notes and the editors of TheTorah.com must have rewritten it in proper English. To alleviate the skepticism I asked to see the original draft he submitted to TheTorah.com and I again confirmed that it was at least 98% of his own writing. Only a few minor edits were made and they were use and stylistic edits, not wholesale rewrites.</p>
<p>But the skepticism remained. People were literally saying that a chasid cannot write so well. It&#8217;s impossible they claimed. I was challenged on my Facebook page and TheTorah.com also received extremely skeptical, bordering on accusatory, comments and feedback.</p>
<p>This is pure bigotry. And it disgusts me.</p>
<p>It is absolutely true that a chasid is going to be severely handicapped by his lack of proper secular education. The average chasid starts much further down on the ladder of English erudition. I don&#8217;t dispute that fact. But with some effort, anyone can learn how to write well. And if one has a gift with words, is able to put ideas into black and white in any language, those skills will translate into beautiful English prose and poetry.</p>
<p>While it is fair to say that a chasid will lack teachable skills simply because a chasid is untaught, it is bigoted to assume that a chasid will lack talent and ability.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/07/15/social-issues-raised-by-the-recent-tragedy/" target="_blank">After the Leiby Kletzky tragedy</a>, I paraphrased <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/11/obligatory-ted-williams-post/" target="_blank">Lee Anne Touhy from &#8220;The Blind Side&#8221;</a>. In talking about the inner city ghetto, Touhy said that the cure for cancer might be in those ghettos. We need to give all youth the opportunity to discover it. The same thing applies to the chasidic ghetto. There are plenty of super talented people behind those walls. Some might have the talent to cure cancer, unfortunately few have the opportunity. Some have the talent to write incredible articles or books in English, unfortunately few have the opportunity.</p>
<p>But when someone gets the opportunity, it&#8217;s cause for celebration and recognition. When a chasid breaks free from the artificial wall his community have placed around him and discovers a special talent, we all benefit. And let&#8217;s not be so prejudiced against chasids that we can&#8217;t believe that talent can be found behind those walls. The only real difference between those on the inside and those on the outside is opportunity. But insofar as talent goes, those on the inside are at least as blessed as those on the outside.</p>
<p>To think that a certain group or subgroup is inherently inferior and incapable of achieving greatness is bigotry. Pure and simple. It&#8217;s no different than saying that a black person cannot be president or that a woman cannot be a Supreme Court Justice or that an Asian cannot play basketball or that an Orthodox Jew cannot be a rockstar. There are talented and incredible people everywhere. Some are given an easier path to discovering and sharing that talent, but talent is everywhere.</p>
<p>We should be encouraging talent from the chasidic community to contribute to greater society, and stop being so shocked when they actually do.</p>
<p>One suggestion would be to stop using &#8220;chasidish&#8221; as a pejorative, whether in style of clothing or otherwise. To stop imitating or mocking chasidic people for their accents and foibles. We all know that non-chasids do it. But it contributes to a bigotry that makes it impossible to believe a chasid might be the next Hemingway. Let&#8217;s help make that happen and not stifle their creativity. Let&#8217;s embrace their talent, not question it. I guarantee you that they will continue to impress us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_5510" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5510" title="Orthodox-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: NY Times</p></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s New York Times features a below the fold, front page article on sex abuse in the Hasidic community of New York. It&#8217;s usually not a good thing when orthodox Jews are on the front page of a newspaper, even below the fold. I am aware that this article reflects poorly on Hasidic Jews in particular and orthodox Jews in general. But I have to say that I found the article to be pretty fair overall and an excellent assessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Contra the article in the Forward, this article does not focus on DA Hynes (although it seems there will be an article about him tomorrow), the article in the NY Times focuses on the victims and the social pressure not to report incidents of abuse.</p>
<p>This is the real problem. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</p>
<p>The article tells the story of several victims and their families who did report the abuse to authorities only to find that they were shunned, excommunicated, or bought off. </p>
<p><span id="more-5509"></span></p>
<p>According to the article it goes all the way to the top. A family member of the Vizhnitz Rebbe in Monsey is alleged to have offered $20,000 to a victim&#8217;s family to drop charges. This is not some low level handler. This is not some shnook with a printer posting signs. This is the Grand Rebbe&#8217;s family. If that is how the leadership of thousands of Hasidic Jews handles abuse, what are we to expect from his followers?</p>
<p>Justice Guston L. Reichbach is a hero for standing up to the support of the community behind the accused and the lack of support for the victim. In court, he expressed deep disappointment with the community&#8217;s response in support of the abuser. He said there was a<em> &#8220;communal attitude that seeks to blame, indeed punish, victims.”</em> He also rebuked the multitude of Hasidic Jews in the courtroom standing in support of the abuser for writing letters in support of the defendant without a single word of <em>&#8220;any concern or any sympathy or even any acknowledgment for these young victims, which, frankly, I find shameful.”</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It was nice to see the workaround for <em>mesira</em> suggested by one rabbi, to tell a psychologist about the abuse and the psychologist will report it. This is completely unnecessary of course. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira (The Jewish Informant) in Halacha</a></p>
<p>In addition to the text of the article, there are several very interesting documents attached. Take some time to read them. They are worth investigating.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that there is no greater incidence of abuse in the ultra-orthodox community. There is just a much lower rate of reporting.</p>
<p>But the most difficult and heartbreaking part of the entire article was the quote from Rabbi Zweibel of the Agudah.</p>
<p>First of all, the Agudah has nothing to do with this. Hasidic groups could not care less what the Agudah says about sex abuse. So his quote is a non-sequitor. But he was asked his opinion and he reaffirmed with what we already know. His organization believes that a victim should go to a rabbi before going to the police. To be fair, the Agudah <em>expects </em>rabbis to be reasonable and advise bona fide victims to go to the police. However, there is little evidence that this will happen. I should also add that this is a step forward, believe it or not. It used to be that one was prohibited to go to the police at all, now one can go if a rabbi advises it. Baby steps.</p>
<p>But the worst part about what he said was this brusque comment: <em>&#8220;You can destroy a person’s life with a false report&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Absorb that for a moment.</p>
<p>The concern is that a false report could ruin someone&#8217;s life. I have two things to say about this. Both are very important.</p>
<p>First, this is built on a fallacious assumption. That is, that only rabbis have the ability to sniff out a false report and further that law enforcement is incapable of doing this task on their own. Both of this are horribly wrong. Rabbis are not trained to discern between true allegations, innuendo, and pure fabrication. Law enforcement professionals are trained to do that. They do it with regularity and with much success. Charges are not brought unless law enforcement is convinced that the abuse happened AND that it could be proved in a court of law. To say that rabbis are needed to protect innocent people who are falsely accused overstates their abilities and understates the reality.</p>
<p>But much, much, much more important is the implication of this policy. Victims of abuse have their entire lives ruined. One cannot overstate the effect of sexual abuse on a person. It haunts them every day of their life. Contemplating suicide is a normal response for a victim of abuse. It can become impossible for victims to function normally. Indeed, many victims have taken their own lives, unable to cope. Sex abuse kills. There are great rabbis who have held that an abuser is a <em>rodef</em>, a pursuer who is trying to kill someone, and anything and everything that can be done to stop them <em>must </em>be done. Sex abuse <em>destroys people&#8217;s lives.</em></p>
<p>I have <em>never </em>heard of someone who was falsely accused of a crime who committed suicide, who could not have a relationship with his or her spouse, who could not love, who could not trust, who could not cope with life. Is it an inconvenience? Absolutely. I  would not wish a false accusation on anybody. But to protect falsely accused people (which are a <em>very</em> rare occurrence) because it could ruin their life, when juxtaposed with the destruction caused by sex abuse comes off as so far removed from reality that it is scary.</p>
<p>To recap: Rabbis are not super-qualified to ascertain the truth of an accusation, law enforcement is qualified. False accusations are rare. When they occur they can harm a person&#8217;s life. To spare the falsely accused at the expense of victims is a heinous travesty of misplaced priorities. It is sick.</p>
<p>I want to end on a more positive note. My rabbis have all said that if one is a victim of abuse they <em>must </em>go to the police. These are ultra-orthodox rabbis. My point is that some rabbis get it. They were not the rabbis interviewed in the NY Times, but they are out there. <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/07/14/yadeinu-shafchu-es-hadam-hazeh/" target="_blank">As Rabbi Adlerstein wrote</a>, <em>&#8220;If your rov (rabbi) doesn’t get it, think of getting a new rov.&#8221;</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5430" title="charles hynes" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="255" /></a>The Forward is fuming at the Brooklyn district attorney for not releasing names of sex abuse suspects in the orthodox Jewish community. The Freedom of Information Act is supposed to give citizens access to government documents and information including the names of individuals arrested for sex abuse.</p>
<p>The DA explained to the Forward that these names are different than other names because they are all of the names requested are part of Hasidic groups and have allegedly abused Hasidic victims. Therefore there is a significant danger that the names of the victims would be discovered.</p>
<p>The Forward then cites several legal scholars who feel that this is an abuse of discretion by the DA. The reactions to this story have been equally heavy-handed. Some going as far as saying that DA Hynes is bought and paid for by the Hasidic community.<span id="more-5428"></span></p>
<p>In legal terms the decision might be wrong. But I don&#8217;t think the anger over this decision should be directed at Hynes and the DA&#8217;s office. I think they are acted reasonably under the circumstances. I really do.</p>
<p>In the Hasidic community, the understanding sex abuse is only its infant stages. Their reaction to abuse is pretty medieval. It&#8217;s hardly as if their is a firm grasp of the harms caused by abuse nor the proper approach to dealing with abuse. This is the reality. There is no way around it.</p>
<p>What would happen if the names were released and the victims names were discovered? It&#8217;s not far-fetched to assume that the victims would be outed. Once the names are outed you can be sure they would be called liars, <em>mosrim</em>, attention-seekers, and other names. It&#8217;s entirely possibly that some &#8220;well-meaning&#8221; vigilantes would take matters into their own hands and silence the victims with threats or violence.</p>
<p>The DA is correct in not releasing the names. But don&#8217;t blame him. Blame the community that would prefer to silence victims and reward its abusive members than do the right thing and weed out this horrible plague from its midst.</p>
<p>I am positive that if the community would deal with abuse like any other normal community the DA would feel comfortable releasing the names of the alleged abusers. But as it stands now, he cannot risk the health or even lives of the victims. I agree with this decision.</p>
<p>This does not give the DA a pass for not prosecuting cases from the community that should be prosecuted. But I think it goes to show just how difficult such prosecutions would be without the cooperation of witnesses and victims. The problem here is not the DA. In fact he understands the community better than his critics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a cover up at all. It&#8217;s protection.</p>
<p>Fix the community and justice will follow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/elevator-story.html" target="_blank">This post has been cross-posted to DovBear</a>. &#8211; more discussion there.</strong></em></p>
<p>In addition to my work as the Rabbi at <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center at the </a><a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Shul</a><a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank"> on the Beach</a> I am also a Law Student at <a href="http://lls.edu">Loyola Law School</a> in Los Angeles. I am part of the evening program and completed my first year of evening classes in May.</p>
<p>In December I was subjected to mid-terms in each of my courses. Many Law School exams are long fact patterns that require the student to analyze the facts and apply all the law that is relevant to the facts and then argue why the law should or should not apply to those facts. Usually these fact patterns are fiction and these essays are typically 3 &#8211; 4 hours in duration.</p>
<p>My torts professor gave us a very interesting fact pattern. The basics of the case were, two young boys named Israel and Jacob enter an elevator on their way to school. Along the way the elevator malfunctions and the boys are suspended between the 10th and 11th floor. The doors malfunction as well and the doors are opened. The younger boy, Jacob is 5 and he tries to jump from the stuck elevator to the 10th floor below. Jacob jumps and <span id="more-783"></span>does not &#8220;<a href="http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/stick_the_landing_1/" target="_blank">stick the landing</a>&#8220;. Unfortunately, he stumbles off the 10th floor and plummeted 10 stories beneath the elevator down the shaft to his death. Israel is eventually rescued.</p>
<p>There were many more legally operative facts in the fact pattern and our professor wanted us to analyze the claims against the building landlord, owner and elevator maintenance company.</p>
<p>It was a pretty shocking case for all of us. When we returned to school after the break our professor told us that the fact pattern was basically a true story with some of the facts changed to make a clearer essay. Immediately I &#8220;googled&#8221; &#8220;Jacob Israel Elevator&#8221;. I found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/nyregion/20fall.html?scp=33&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt" target="_blank">the original NY Times article with the tragic story</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Times had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/nyregion/13elevator.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;sq=elevator&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1" target="_blank">another article on the ongoing litigation</a>. Apparently, the defense wants young Israel, who is 10 and traumatized to testify. This is horrible as any memories of the tragedy could alter his psychological well being tremendously. The case is being litigated as you read this.</p>
<p>I told this entire saga to two people I know. They are both very caring and sensitive people. They both had the same reaction and that reaction is what prompted this post.</p>
<p>When I told the story over, both people had serious looks on their faces and clearly empathized with the poor child.</p>
<p>Then I told them, by the way, the little boys were <em>Chasidish children from Williamsburg</em>.</p>
<p>They both had the same second reaction. Their jaws dropped and they exclaimed <em>Oy! That&#8217;s terrible</em>! A much harsher reaction reaction than before they knew the boys&#8217; ethnicity.</p>
<p>At first I was disturbed. Do we care more about some poor Chasidish kids from Williamsburg than anyone else? Is this tragedy worse to us because they are Jewish?</p>
<p>Is this a good attitude? Could this bother non-Jews and provoke anti-semitism?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps it is normal for us to care more about our Jewish brethren. Maybe, we should feel more compassion for our fellow Jews. After all, it is a rule of Jewish law that we are responsible for one another.</p>
<p>This has been gnawing at me for a little while now. Should we care more about a Jewish tragedy than a non-Jewish tragedy?</p>
<p>Even if we are allowed to care more about a Jewish tragedy should we try and mask our feelings to be more politically correct?</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t we outraged when non-Jews do not care about Jewish tragedy as much as non-Jewish tragedy?</p>
