				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It takes courage for any victim of abuse to come forward and accuse their abuser. It&#8217;s almost suicidal to try it in New Square. Yet, that is just what a young man named Yossi has done.</p>
<p>He sat down with News 12 Westchester for an in depth report. Journalist Tara Rosenblum talked with Yossi and spent some time in New Square researching this story. She does an excellent job. Â If she&#8217;s eligible, I vote this reporter for the Pulitzer.<span id="more-7598"></span></p>
<p>The heartbreaking part of this is neighbors and children naively believing that the abuser Herschel Taubenfeld is not only innocent, but he is a safe person around their children. He is not. Yet, he is teaching in the school and mothers have no problem with it whatsoever.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-7602" alt="Screen Shot 2013-08-31 at 10.39.14 PM" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.39.14-PM.png?resize=420%2C238" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s even worse is that Yossi, for all his bravery, did not even manage to keep Taubenfeld off the streets. The Ramapo DA thinks that six years probation is going to keep kids safe. I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s possible. No one is going to report this guy to the police again so it&#8217;s unlikely that his probation will deter him nor will he ever violate the probation because he will never be reported.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how Rabbi Noson Leiter got involved in this case. I thought his thing was being anti-gay marriage. Anyway, he says the right things even if his part of the segment made me cringe.</p>
<p>This kid gets a medal for coming forward and hopefully he can inspire some sanity to this town. At the very least, people who don&#8217;t live in New Square should not be supporting or visiting this make believe city upon a hill until they get their act together. Attempted murder and rape can not be tolerated but in New Square they are. It&#8217;s time for the good people of the world to make it stop.</p>
<p>Watch the segment and cheer for Yossi.</p>

Part 1: </em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/"><em>Thoughts on Kiryas Joel: The Poorest City in America</em></a><em> and Part 2: </em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/01/attempted-murder-in-new-square-an-analysis/"><em>Attempted Murder in New Square: An Analysis</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>There is a certain common sentiment amongst many minorities and ethnicities. It is commonly expressed as &#8220;bringing shame to the family&#8221;. Or sometimes it emerges as a threat &#8220;what will the neighbors think&#8221;. Once in a while you will hear something about the &#8220;family name&#8221;.</p>
<p>These are normal, and by normal I mean occuring fairly regularly, among minorities. These stereotypes are played on incessantly in Hollywood movies and television programs and they make for good entertainment sometimes (eg Bend it Like Beckham).</p>
<p>In Judaism there is a concept of a Shem Tov, a good name. The verse in Ecclesiastes says: &#8220;Tov shem m&#8217;shemen tov&#8221;, a good name is better than good oil. Earning a good reputation and keeping it has a place in the Jewish thought.<span id="more-4304"></span></p>
<p>Based on my readings, anecdotal evidence and observations I think it is safe to say that orthodox Jews are very concerned with reputation. It is the currency of our social environment. I remember when I was in high school I would hear about girls who would talk to boys, but not in public because they &#8220;didn&#8217;t want to ruin their name&#8221;. Schools are careful who they accept into their school because with each new student comes their reputation. Families hide dark secrets so as not to ruin the family name. Matchmaking runs almost entirely on the &#8220;good name stock market&#8221;.</p>
<p>In particular, based on the aforementioned sources, I think it safe to say that enclosed chasidic enclaves take reputations to the next level. There is a communal concern about not only personal reputations and family reputations but there is a general community reputation that exists and is cared for.</p>
<p>The way a good reputation is supposed to work is as follows: A person carries their self well, speaks nicely, follows the law, cares for others and slowly but surely, people notice. A reputation is formed. Â However, one small act can destroy even the most pristine reputation. And it can be nearly impossible to recover that good name. I am fond of quoting Ray Donovan. Donovan was a high ranking federal government official during the Reagan administration. He was indicted on charges of fraud among other crimes. Eventually he was acquitted. After his acquittal he famously remarked: &#8220;Which office do I go to get my reputation back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed a shem tov can take years to create and be destroyed in an instant.</p>
<p>A good name arises organically. It is a natural result of good deeds and good will. A reputation cannot be fabricated. It cannot be crafted. It cannot be orchestrated. If it is, the reputation is a fraud.</p>
<p>On DovBear&#8217;s blog I posted a note from a fellow living in New Square (see: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/06/insider-reaction-to-new-square-violence.html">The Insider Reaction to New Square Violence</a>). The writer is reacting to the arson / attempted murder of a fellow community by a fellow community member. He focuses very little on the actual incident. Near the end he prays to God. What does he pray?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Why did God allow Skver to take such a public hit and for the entire community to be embarrassed? I am not in heaven, so this makes no sense to me, why we have received such a punishment?</em></p>
<p>Even in New Square&#8217;s darkest moment, the obsession with embarrassment, reputation and good name is apparent.</p>
<p>But the line speaks to a complete misunderstanding of reputation. A reputation is not crafted. It is earned. And it can be lost rather easily. You can&#8217;t keep a good name when your community has committed horrible acts. Sorry.</p>
<p>Yet, there is a concerted effort by communities like New Square to maintain the pristine image they have crafted while sacrificing or simply ousting those who tarnish it. They don&#8217;t address the problems because the problems are not the issue. The issue is the reputation.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> the parents of children with severe issues, whether it was abuse or simply the child&#8217;s concerns about whether they should be religious, were met with a primary concern over reputation and a secondary (if any at all) concern about addressing the issue.</p>
<p>It has been no different in New Square. The Rebbe&#8217;s comments thus far have been his message to try and repair or resurrect his community&#8217;s good name. But of course, the reputation and good name is not the issue at all. The issue is the broken system in his community. The issue is an attempt on a man and his family&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>The lesson is clear. A good name is earned. It is not manufactured in a spin factory. If you behave contrary to your reputation you lose it. More importantly, if your reputation is harmed because of bad deeds, the first step to fixing your reputation is by fixing the bad deeds. The reputation will return the same way it was earned (hopefully). It doesn&#8217;t magically return when you reiterate positive acts that may have contributed to earning the good name.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, in a backwards town, they got it all backwards.</p>

<p>The chasidic town of New Square (an enclave that is very similar to KJ) has found itself in the news for all the wrong reasons. Last week an 18 year old goon attempted to burn down a man&#8217;s home along with the people inside the home. The target had been a victim of intimidation and vandalism on previous occasions so he had recently installed a surveillance system of cameras around his home. It was on these cameras that the victim first saw the goon. He went outside and confronted the goon.</p>
<p>A short brawl ensued and the goon lit his Molotov cocktail and fled. Both men caught on fire but the house was spared. The victim suffered severe burns all over his body and has already undergone skin grafts.</p>
<p>The arson and attempted murder were escalations of previous action against the victim. Prior to this incident he had been subject to protests in front of his home, broken windows in his car and his home.</p>
<p>What crime did the victim commit that sparked vandalism and violence?<span id="more-4297"></span></p>
<p>He prayed at an old age home nearby instead of praying in the community synagogue. The grand rabbi of New Square requires that all residents of New Square attend the same prayer service on Friday nights. The victim did not attend. The goons were enforcing the rabbi&#8217;s rule.</p>
<p>No one excuses the behavior of the goon. Social pressure is one thing, by violence is inexcusable. It would be unfair for me or anyone to place specific blame on anyone other than the goon who committed this act. There is no hard evidence that he was instructed to do what he did. There is some circumstantial evidence but for purposes of this article, it will be conceded that this person acted alone.</p>
<p>One response that I have seen on blogs, Twitter posts and Facebook comments is that the victim &#8220;had it coming&#8221;. (See: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/05/avi-shafran-on-new-square.html">Avi Shafran on New Square</a>)Â The village has a rule. He chose to live there and should expect that he will suffer some indignity for his failure to live by the standard of the village. Further, if he doesn&#8217;t like the rules, he should have left the village instead of staying AND breaking the rules.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this completely misses the point.</p>
<p>There was another scandal this week. The Head Football Coach at Ohio State University resigned amid a whirlwind of allegations that he assisted and enabled players to break the rules of NCAA. The players are being disciplined and their Head Coach, Jim Tressel has resigned and is being crucified in the media.</p>
<p>Jason Whitlock wrote a really great column about the scandal (<a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/Former-Ohio-State-coach-Jim-Tressel-is-product-of-flawed-system-053111" target="_blank">Tressel Product of Flawed System</a>). Whitlock contends, and I agree with him, that while Tressel is culpable for his sins, he is really just the product of a system built on lies. The primary lie being that student athletes are amateur. Whitlock has been saying forever, and I have been agreeing just as long, that the NCAA is the biggest fraud in America. They make billions of dollars off of these athletes but the athletes see none of that money. To maintain amateur status they must adhere to thousands of rules that basically prohibit them from taking any gifts or benefits from anybody.</p>
<p>Tressel was just part of the system. He didn&#8217;t create the problem. He didn&#8217;t make the problem worse. He was just a cog in a mighty machine. Indeed, he broke the rules. However the system is deeply flawed and everyone is breaking the rules that the real criminal here is not Tressel. It is the NCAA. [The same should be said for USC, Reggie Bush, OJ Mayo and Pete Carrol.]
<p>What happened in New Square is the result of a flawed system.</p>
<p>Any system that demands absolute fealty in every respect of one&#8217;s life, stripping one of independence and the opportunity to think and choose is a bad system. Any system that demonizes someone for asserting one smidgen of original thought is a bad system.</p>
<p>The perpetrators of violence and social terrorism are cogs in the machine. The machine is the problem. It isn&#8217;t the cogs.</p>
<p>To complete the analogy, the arsonist was a football player, the leadership is Jim Tressel and they are all part of a system like the NCAA.</p>
<p>The system needs to be fixed. The cogs are all responsible for their actions but the most frustrating thing is that their actions <em>are justifiable in the system.</em> That is why the system needs to be scrapped. It permits behavior like this to occur. This incident is only one example of a rotten system. There are more.</p>
<p>Maintaining control over people is not easy. But with per se poverty and social terror it becomes easier to enforce. That is part of the reason why the Kiryas Joel situation is so problematic. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/">Thoughts onÂ KiryasÂ Joel: The Poorest City in America</a>).Â It creates a breeding ground for anti-social behavior.</p>
<p>According to Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch the Torah is designed to create a positive social environment for growth and spiritual development. It can&#8217;t be that poverty, oppression, terror and anti-social behavior are the <em>darchei noam</em>, pleasant ways of the Torah. It just can&#8217;t.</p>
