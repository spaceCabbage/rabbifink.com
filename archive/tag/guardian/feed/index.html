				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/prohibition.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4368" title="prohibition" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/prohibition.jpg?resize=238%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It&#8217;s been almost 40 years. Is that long enough for a war?</p>
<p>Whenever one begins a war one needs to consider the exit strategies. This was a fatal flaw in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe it is also a fatal flaw in the one war being fought on American soil: The War on Drugs.</p>
<p><span>It is hard to consider what was thought of as the end game of this war when it began. Was the end of the war going to be some utopian time where no one used drugs? Was it when all the drug users were in prison? How would winning this war look?</span></p>
<p>We can ponder those questions because we know with certainty what losing this war looks like.</p>
<p>I asked a public defender who works in felonies what percentage of their cases are small time drug charges (not drug king pin charges). Her response? 90%. 90%! Nine out of ten people being processed by our criminal justice system for serious crimes were busted for drugs.<span id="more-4367"></span></p>
<p>Felony drug charges can be filed for tiny amounts of drugs (like enough for a couple &#8220;highs&#8221;).</p>
<p><span>The prisons are bursting with drug criminals. It costs $40,000 a year to incarcerate someone for 1 year. 1 year! It costs untold amounts of money and energy to arrest, prosecute and defend these drug criminals. It is very easy for police to arrest drug users. They go to the neighborhood and &#8220;sell&#8221; drugs to addicts. Their partner arrests the users a moment later. They can arrest 100 people in a day like that. They go through the criminal justice system and weigh down the system.</span></p>
<p>The selective prosecution of immigrants and under-privileged drug users is horrifying. At frat parties across the country drugs are used with no consequence. The hobo who gets high goes to prison for a few months, years, decades even life. Three drug arrests and convictions can lead to life in prison (or more accurately death in prison). If someone who is undocumented gets picked up for a drug charge, even if the drug charge is dropped or fabricated they can be deported. Losing fathers, brothers, mothers and sisters to the drug war only increases the social problems in lower class neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks there has been an encouraging development, more and more news articles have appeared in the media calling for an end to the drug war.</p>
<p>First, The Guardian reported that world leaders were calling for an end to the international drug war. The names associated with the Global Commission on Drug Policy&#8217;s push come from all over the world. The problem exists internationally to the point that the US sends $1.4 billion in aid to Mexico and Central American nations to wage their drug wars at home. The commission is calling for decriminalization and legal regulation.</p>
<p>Then, in The Atlantic, I saw a great line from David Simon, creator of The Wire, which really told to story of the drug war to the people. The show is based on the real drug war in downtown Baltimore. It accurately portrays the many issues with the drug war. For some reason, Eric Holder asked for another season of The Wire. Simon said he would be happy to consider it if the administration was ready to reconsider its current stance on the drug war.</p>
<p>Next, President Jimmy Carter weighed in with his endorsement for ending the drug war. Citing the great work of the aforementioned international group, Carter turns the issue into a political one and talks about how great he was and how bad Reagan was. But there are some worthwhile points in his Op-Ed. For example, in California 11% of the budget goes to prisons and 7.5% goes to higher education. He calls on the American government to adopt the strategies of the Global Commission on Drug Policy.</p>
<p><span>Perhaps the most important factor is that Americans from all political ideologies can agree on this. Conservatives want to spend less money on drug enforcement. Liberals want to even the playing field for under-privileged folks and libertarians don&#8217;t want the government telling people what they can and cannot do.</span></p>
<p>We can all agree on this issue. Doesn&#8217;t it make sense to stop fighting about things we will never agree on for just a few minutes to end the War on Drugs? It seems to me that we can actually get some good work done if we would fix the things we agree about.</p>
<p>What should the drug policy be? Same as alcohol. Indoors only. Sold and taxed. Public intoxication or endangerment to others would be illegal.</p>
<p>What would happen? The courts would be less burdened. Our prisons would be mostly empty (and humane). The police and the citizens in their neighborhoods would have a less adversarial relationship due to less arrests and less fake drug sales. Police could return to more wholesome police work. Our local and federal government would have money to spend on much more important projects. We all win.</p>
<p>End this war.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3716" title="the-future" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg?resize=300%2C239" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you&#8217;ve known me for a little while you know I am an optimist. If we&#8217;ve talked about the conflict in the Middle East you know I am optimistic about that too.</p>
<p>For a little while now (at least a couple of years) I have maintained that the conflict will in effect, resolve itself, eventually.</p>
<p>Until recently, Gazans and West Bank Palestinians have heard one voice. A voice that told them in categorical terms that their life would be better under autonomous rule by Hamas or the PLO. Palestinians believed them. It created fanatics, fascists and suicide bombers. But people can only be told a lie so long as there is no evidence to the contrary.<span id="more-3710"></span></p>
<p>If someone tells you that the world is flat you know he is lying because you have information that shows him to be lying. Information is king. Therefore, I have contended that my generation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y" target="_blank">Generation Y</a>) is the information generation. My generation does not accept lies or legends at face value. We know there is a way to learn on our own to unmask lies passed off as facts or legends passed off as history. We are the Wikipedia generation. We know that the information is available and we are willing to find it ourselves.</p>
<p>So long as information can be controlled, the public will kneel to authority, corrupt or otherwise. But once information is freely available to the masses, the lies unravel, the legends are exposed and truth can prevail. Authority that told those lies and legends is discarded and the people want truth, a voice and democracy. I have been saying that my generation of Palestinians and Muslims in general who have access to information will undoubtedly prefer to join the West in its freedoms, capitalism and democracy.</p>
<p>When the choices are death or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is easy. When the choice is money, entertainment, enlightenment or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is even easier. With the wave of unbridled information entering the oppressed masses in Arab countries, fundamental fanaticism will be replaced with a thirst for information and the allure of modern civilization. A lifestyle of books and e-books, Facebook and Twitter, Playstation and XBOX, e-commerce and ebay sure as heck beats a Third World existence. This is why my generation will resolve the conflict. Conflict serves no one but the elite and corrupt leaders. It will mean out with oppressive rulers and in with freedom.</p>
<p>The beginnings of this movement has already been formed in Gaza. A few weeks ago the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/02/free-gaza-youth-manifesto-palestinian" target="_blank">Guardian reported</a> on a &#8220;Manifesto&#8221; written by disgruntled Palestinians. They don&#8217;t want Hamas, they don&#8217;t want Fatah, they don&#8217;t want Israel, they want freedom.</p>
<p>What happened in Tunisia and what is happening right now in Egypt is more of the same. The people will not be controlled by corrupt Heads of State who demand allegiance for no reason other than &#8220;I said so&#8221;. The people want their freedom. They want what we have in the West. And they will get it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/28/president-reagans-message-for-protesters-in-egypt/">President Reagan’s Message for the Protesters in Egypt</a>)</p>
<p>A little bit of patience and gentle prodding from the West will help the next generation of Arabs achieve their emancipation. I maintain that 9/11 was a final salvo. The fundamentalist establishment tried one last time to supress the free flow of information by trying to destroy it. They failed and freedom is around the corner.</p>
<p>Just ask the protestors in Tunisia and Egypt.</p>
<p>I do admit that the protests are not without flaws. It is entirely possible that the new leaders will be equally despotic as their predecessors. We can only hope that will not be the case. But even if it is, it won&#8217;t last long. Change is coming. The cat is out of the bag and freedom is like a drug that is addictive and readily available. The public won&#8217;t be satisfied until they can drink the elixir of freedom. And they will.</p>
<p>This phenomena has also affected the orthodox Jewish community. The more information that becomes available, the more the religious leaders are concerned about losing their authority. This is silly. The authority of rabbis was never binding except in a rabbinic court or perhaps via an uncontested responsa. It is a folly of this generation&#8217;s leadership (or its handlers) that asserted this unilateral power. It never existed and yes, with information this imagined power will disappear. This is why the Internet is so feared by these rabbis. That is why the Internet is banned in charedi circles. It is because of the information and free flow of ideas that the Internet provides which in turn minimizes their invented power. Orthodox Judaism does not depend on charismatic or authoritarian rabbis, it depends of individual commitment to Jewish law and theology. Information is a boon to that kind of religious practice. If we are confident in orthodox Judaism as a viable way of life, information must be a friend, not a foe. I know that I am confident, I can&#8217;t say the same for those who cower in fear from information.</p>
<p>The future is now, or coming soon enough. The Internet is giving people a thirst for freedom and independence. Totalitarianism cannot win against the almost infinite amount of information that is easily accessible from a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">device smaller</a> than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoPf98i8A0g" target="_blank">George Costanza&#8217;s wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Say hello to the future.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
