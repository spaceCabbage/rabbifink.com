We talked a bit about what this means and why it&#8217;s necessary. Then we were joined by my superstar guest, Rabbi Doniel Katz.</p>
<p>In my view, Rabbi Katz is leading the charge in addressing these issues. We come from very different perspectives but our ideas overlap significantly. It was a great discussion and we could have done another 8 hours, at least.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2005, I took my group of college students to Israel on an inspirational trip. The format of the trip was study in the mornings and tour the rest of the day. The guys studied at Aish HaTorah and the girls studied at Neve Yerushalayim. Aish provided a basic curriculum and some of their best instructors. But not all the teachers were good and I had promised my students &#8220;the best&#8221; so I poked around and asked if there was anyone that could replace some of the less engaging teachers.</p>
<p>Someone, and I don&#8217;t remember who, pointed to a slight young man who was dressed in semi-hasidic garb and said, this guy might be good, he has no experience teaching here, but he might be what you&#8217;re looking for. I was sold. The next day I introduced Rabbi Daniel Katz to my group and he was an instant favorite. In my subsequent trips to Israel I requested Rabbi Katz and made sure I got at least a few classes with him. Some people thought I was a little crazy because I was replacing world famous teachers with a relatively unknown young rabbi, but I trusted my instincts and persisted. By the time my final trip rolled around, Aish was giving me a hard time about having Rabbi Katz teach my group because he was in such high demand. I reminded them that he got his start with my group and they relented. As always, Rabbi Katz was a hit.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had lunch with Rabbi Katz.<span id="more-8250"></span> It was our first face to face interaction since 2006. We hung out for two hours but we could have gone for hours longer. After all this time, I can confirm that Rabbi Katz is still one my favorite people ever.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sb-speaking.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8253" alt="sb-speaking" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sb-speaking.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>On the surface, we are an odd match. He is very involved in Chassidus and the more mystical kind of Judaism that doesn&#8217;t usually speak to me. I am very involved in Maimoniean Judaism and Halacha. That&#8217;s the kind of Judaism that speaks less to Rabbi Katz. But in so many ways we are saying the same things just using very different language.</p>
<p>More importantly, the things that bother me most about Kabbalistic Mysticism as it practiced today are the same things that bother Rabbi Katz. He is not interested in segulos, the scoreboard in the sky, or purely spiritual benefits of mitzvah observance. His philosophy is very focused on character development and understanding the mind using the wisdom of Chassidus. But it&#8217;s all very hands-on and practical. I like that a lot.</p>
<p>We both have no need or interest in denominations and division among the Jewish people. Rabbi Katz&#8217;s teachings appeal to Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews alike. It&#8217;s not about becoming Orthodox. It is about experiencing an awesome version of Judaism. I try to do the same thing with a different version of Judaism. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s only for Orthodox or non-Orthodox Jews. It&#8217;s just for Jewish Jews and you could even throw some non-Jews into the mix too.</p>
<p>During our talk we shared ideas about outreach and the current state of Orthodox Judaism. We agreed on almost everything but we express it in different ways. I love talking to people who seem different than me and learning or confirming that we have a lot more in common than one might think. Spending a couple of hours with Rabbi Katz was a tease. I am already looking forward to his next visit and our next conversation.</p>
<p>I remember loving Rabbi Katz in 2005, but it was interesting to see that I love him even more in 2014. To me, he is on a beautiful path of Judaism and I think he is providing an invaluable resource by leading powerful seminars on personal growth and character development. His Torah is the kind of Torah that helps us to be better people. He believes there is value in the Jewish experience and we need to provide Jewish experiences to as many people as possible. Most of all, Rabbi Katz believes that Judaism that each person needs to find the version of Orthodox Judaism that works best for them. There is no one true path to the exclusion of the others. Some people might appreciate his version more than mine and vice versa. But in the end, we both see our personal preferences as just that, preferences, and not indications of incontrovertible dogma.</p>
<p>Rabbi Katz does seminars called Elevation Seminars. He teaches people how to address their fears and doubts in an effort to engage in life&#8217;s challenges with one&#8217;s full arsenal of skills and abilities. Elevation Seminars are getting incredible reviews. People are learning, growing, and enjoying the process of learning how to experience life from Rabbi Katz&#8217;s perspective. I don&#8217;t think I would consider attending something like this seminar under normal circumstances. But I feel a kinship with Rabbi Katz and I think I would attend an Elevation Seminar. Certainly if you are someone who would enjoy this kind of thing, find out when Rabbi Katz is going to be in your area. If he&#8217;s not coming yet, bring him to you. If that doesn&#8217;t work out, go to him.</p>
<p>There are some people that you encounter in life that exude dignity, kindness, and wisdom. I meet a lot of people. I can&#8217;t think of the last person that could match Rabbi Katz using those benchmarks. Even if the content was terrible (it&#8217;s not), I think it&#8217;s worth just spending time observing and enjoying the company of a great man like Rabbi Katz. He is the kind of person that I look up to and I hope others start to catch on to his greatness. We need more people like Rabbi Katz.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this is the most unlikely endorsement of Rabbi Katz and his work. Take that as you wish. I am being completely sincere and I was not asked to write any of this. I just had a lovely experience and know that many others might want to explore the idea of trying to have a similar experience. I hope Elevation Seminars become a regular occurrence around the world. I hope that we all find our place within Judaism as Rabbi Katz has and as Rabbi Katz provides for others.</p>
<p>For now, I am happy knowing that Rabbi Katz is reaching people and using his immense talent and charisma to give others tools for living a great life. A life of Elevation.</p>
