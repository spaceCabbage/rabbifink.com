(As opposed to this &#8220;Great Idea&#8221;: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/15/an-interesting-alternative-to-prison/">An Interesting Alternative to Prison</a>)</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the front page of the NY Times ran an article about criminal registries. A few states and local districts are considering online registries for criminals similar to the online sex offender registry.</p>
<p>The offenses being considered as grounds for registration range from arson to animal abuse.</p>
<p>The basic arguments for the registry are that the public has the right to know and make decisions about law breakers in their neighborhoods. If I don&#8217;t want to live near a dangerous (or not so dangerous criminal) I have that right.</p>
<p>The basic arguments against the registry? There are quite a few.<span id="more-4267"></span></p>
<p>What is the point of the registry?</p>
<p>To protect those who know about it? Does it really protect them? Are you really less safe around a a known offender than an unknown offender?</p>
<p>To isolate the offenders? So that they have nowhere to live? No where to work? Will that help them get their lives back together? If no one moves near the offenders and no one gives them jobs because they are on a list, how will they reintegrate into society?</p>
<p>There is a registry for drunk drivers in Maine. How in the world does this help or protect anyone? Drunk drivers can drive anywhere they want. And they are probably more likely to drive drunk near the bars than near their homes.</p>
<p>There is a registry to murderers proposed in Illinois. Murder recidivism rates are very very low. That means that if a convicted murderer is released from prison they are very unlikely to commit another murder. So a list of murderers has low utility but creates huge stigma.</p>
<p>Not to mention the cost. These lists are very expensive to set up and maintain.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t these kinds of lists also give rise to vigilantism? I don&#8217;t know. But the more lists we have, the greater risk there is for offenders.</p>
<p>Also, at least in LA, most crime happens in certain neighborhoods between specific groups of people. (You know what I mean&#8230;) Registries of those kinds of offenders seem pretty useless to me. Spending tons of money to basically have a public list of gang members? Who rarely venture out of their own neighborhoods?</p>
<p>But most of all, the registries represent an absolute lack of faith in our criminal justice system. If criminals who have gone through the system are still dangerous, then the system has failed them. Why put them behind bars at all if they are the same person who went in?</p>
<p>If we are aware that the system is failing then the solution is certainly not to make a list of all the people for whom the system failed. It&#8217;s TO FIX THE SYSTEM. Legislation for registries makes law makers appear tough on crime. Tough on crime accomplishes nothing in the long term. Registries aren&#8217;t even tough on crime, they APPEAR to be tough on crime. We don&#8217;t need faux toughness to solve our criminal justice issues. We need reform.</p>
<p>The suggestion of these registries is a wake up call. Our system needs fixing. Rehabilitate criminals. Create social solutions to battle the factors that create crime. Get involved in the high crime neighborhoods and instead of counting collars, count crimes prevented.</p>
<p>Registries are a wasteful way of pretending to solve a problem. Sorry, it&#8217;s not going to work. Try again.</p>

<p>This is what the shoe feels like when it&#8217;s on the other foot.</p>
<p>For decades, right-wing / republican / conservative / Judeo-Christian Valuists have talked a big game when it comes to fighting crime. Running on &#8220;Law and Order&#8221; platforms and promising harsh sentences for criminals was a sure way to gain support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, bleeding heart liberals have been trying to model the justice system after the softer Euro sentencing structures.</p>
<p>Traditionally, middle class white people support Law and Order style justice. Harsh sentences make them feel safer and they are less likely to know someone who will be incarcerated, thus they are removed from the effects of the harsh sentencing of criminals.</p>
<p>Lower class folks usually support softer punishments.<span id="more-2572"></span> They are the ones who are more likely to have friends and relatives in the justice system. For many of them, the softer the punishment, the sooner they get their daddy back.</p>
<p>It was real easy for us middle class white (Jewish) people to support strict sentencing guidelines when it didn&#8217;t really affect us. But after witnessing one of our own fall prey to the system we helped create I am sure we all feel differently. (Of course I am aware that there are some middle class white Jews who vote democrat and support liberal causes, I am talking to everyone else.)</p>
<p>27 years is a long time. Rubashkin is a crook but his sentence is very harsh. We now feel what lower class communities have felt for so long. Some of us now think the system is out to get us. They have felt that way all along. Some of us now are horrified by the sentencing guidelines and the leeway given to particularly strict judges. They have been saying this is a problem all along.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time for our community to more fully support softer punishments for all criminals. In some states (like mine &#8211; California) we are spending millions and millions of dollars locking up &#8220;3 Strikes&#8221; criminals for LIFE (including non-violent, minor felonies). That is even harsher than Rubashkin&#8217;s sentence. If we are outraged over his sentence let that outrage spill over into more socially conscious, activist role and help modify our current justice system.</p>
<p>But please, for intellectual honesty&#8217;s sake, be consistent. If you think Rubashkin got a raw deal, do some research and learn about how other people who made mistakes in their teens will spend their entire lives in jail because of America&#8217;s love of retribution. Help everyone who got shafted by the system and let&#8217;s try and prevent this from happening again, to anyone.</p>

<p>There is a very ambitious fellow in our class at <a href="http://lls.edu" target="_blank">Law School</a>. His name is Paymon Khatibi. One day Paymon decided that our class should start an independent journal of law related articles. We would write student notes just like the official Law Reviews and publish them online in a digital journal. Sounds easy, right?</p>
<p>Well it took a lot of work and management to have all the pieces fall into place. Incredibly, Paymon was relentless and did not give up on this dream of his. Today, that dream has become a reality. And for that we are all very grateful.</p>
<p>The Loyola Journal has been published online and is open to all readers.<span id="more-2355"></span> The inaugural issue has 76 pages and includes an interview with famed litigator Robert Shapiro as well as articles about immigration, domestic violence and Guantanamo Bay among others.</p>
<p>When Paymon asked who would be interested in writing for the journal, I volunteered. I like writing and thought it would be a great experience.</p>
<p>As we were studying Felony Murder in Criminal Law I met an incredible woman named Professor Gilda Zwerman from New York. She was taking a little break from New York and was staying in Venice. One Shabbos she decided to drop into the Shul on the Bwach where I am the Rabbi. We met a few times subsequently and she joined my family and some other guests for a Shabbos lunch.</p>
<p>Professor Zwerman told me about a famous Felony Murder conviction in my hometown of Monsey NY! A young Jewish woman (at the time, in 1980) was involved in a well-known Brinks truck robbery. We talked extensively about the case as Ms. Zwerman has become a strong advocate for the release of the now middle aged Jewish woman who has turned her life around while incarcerated.</p>
<p>I strongly urge you all to read her story at <a href="http://www.judithclark.org/about.functions.php?view=about" target="_blank">JudithClark.org</a>.</p>
<p>Hearing Judith Clark&#8217;s story and reading up on Felony Murder while we were studying it in class really gave me a lot to think about. I decided to try and understand the doctrine and realized that in my opinion the whole thing is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>So I decided to write an article explaining how it came to be that we have such an unfair rule in our legal system. It is pretty interesting and is written in a way that a non-lawyer / law student should be able to understand it.</p>
<p>I hope you will take a few minutes to read it and feel free to sound off in the comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1101" title="death-penalty" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/death-penalty.jpg?resize=126%2C162" alt="death-penalty" data-recalc-dims="1" />Yesterday we began learning about Homicide in our Criminal Law class at Loyola Law School. Our Criminal Law professor is world famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Levenson" target="_blank">Laurie Levenson</a> (<a href="http://news.google.com/news?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=laurie%20levenson&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wn" target="_blank">she is in the news very often</a>). She is an incredible teacher and a very successful practitioner. Studying Criminal Law in her class is a privilege. (Plus, she brings baked goodies for the class and sometimes stops at Schwartz&#8217;s Bakery to get some kosher goodies for the two Kosher observant Jews in the class. Pretty nice!)</p>
<p>After learning the building blocks of Criminal Law we began our unit in homicide.</p>
<p><span id="more-1099"></span>One of the first homicide cases we read was a <a href="http://www.4lawschool.com/anderson.htm" target="_blank">brutal murder of a 10 year old girl</a>. The defendant offered no defense. He undeniably killed her in a brutal fashion, while intoxicated he took a knife to her, stabbing her about 60 times as he chased her around the house. The court decided that he could not get the death penalty.</p>
<p>Why? The court says that brutality of a murder is not a factor in considering whether a murder is in the 1st degree (incurring the death penalty). First degree murder requires &#8220;premeditation&#8221; and that is analyzed by looking at 3 factors. 1) planning 2) motive and 3) manner. In this case, the defendant did not plan, had no motive and the manner was not a methodical way of killing. It was random and unnecessary. The court sentenced him to life in prison and he escaped the death penalty.</p>
<p>Many of my co-students found this very difficult to swallow. Here we have a violent, brutal murder who will not get 1st degree murder. Some of my co-students wanted the murderer brutally killed in retribution.</p>
<p>In Jewish Law, murder and some other capital crimes are punishable by a death penalty. How does one &#8220;qualify&#8221; for the death penalty? A murderer must be warned by two witnesses that his offense will incur the death penalty. He must acknowledge their warning. Then he must commit the murder with 10 seconds. This approach to capital punishment reflects a basic tenet of Judaism.</p>
<p>Judaism is all about moral choices. Therefore, Judaism punishes the murderer who is making a clear, coherent choice. Only with fair warning and a true understanding of one&#8217;s actions are the murderer&#8217;s actions a clear indication of moral choice to commit murder.</p>
<p>In our Law School case, the fellow did not make a conscious choice. The 3 factors that demonstrate premeditation all demonstrate a choice by the murderer. Planning a murder shows that the murder truly understands what he is doing and is choosing his action of murder. Same for motive and manner. We need to see a conscious choice to take a life for murder to be in the 1st degree.</p>
<p>A drunk man who crazily kills for no reason is not a murderer in the 1st degree. He is a sociopath and must be locked up. But to take his life away via the death penalty requires more than just killing another. It requires a moral choice.</p>
<p>Judaism teaches us that our life is made up of little more than the moral choices we make. Our choices are who we are.</p>
<p>Choose wisely.</p>
