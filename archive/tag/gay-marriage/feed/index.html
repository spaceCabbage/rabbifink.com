				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that it is unconstitutional for a state to ban same sex marriage. The issue still divides America, though the latest Pew numbers say 54% of Americans are in favor of gay marriage and only 36% oppose.</p>
<p>In the Orthodox Jewish community, the matter is far less polarizing. I could not find any actual numbers, but I think most people are correct in assuming that the vast majority of Orthodox Jews oppose same sex marriage for themselves and for America. All the mainstream Orthodox Jewish umbrella organizations have issued statements over the past few years reiterating this opposition. Some Orthodox Jews are ambivalent on the issue, and a small minority are in favor of gay marriage.</p>
<p>I celebrate the Supreme Court decision.<span id="more-9339"></span></p>
<p>A lot of people are confused how an Orthodox rabbi who follows the Torah and its laws could celebrate the legalization of gay marriage.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/28/i-believe-in-torah-halacha-and-equality/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1-si/" rel="attachment wp-att-9340"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9340" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si_.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I have been mocked, berated, insulted, defrocked, and even ousted from Orthodoxy for supporting marriage equality. I’ve been asked, respectfully and less respectfully, how I reconcile my  belief in marriage equality and my religious beliefs. This is my official response.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a civil rights issue. Gay people exist. They are your neighbors and co-workers. They might be your friends and family as well. It’s hard to be gay in America. There’s trauma involved. Gay people fall in love. They want to live together as a married couple. They want to get married for the same reasons everyone else wants to get married. Restricting consenting adults from a loving, committed marriage is a form of discrimination. I believe that discrimination is wrong. I believe that citizens of free countries should not feel oppressed. I believe that more freedom for more people is a good thing for everyone, including Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>Of course, I am concerned about the implications of the ruling. I am concerned about clergy with religious objections to officiating a gay marriage, but those personal concerns cannot trump the more basic civil rights of others, especially people who typically suffer persecution and discrimination.</p>
<p>I am not concerned about slippery slopes or men marrying dogs and bikes and children. Marriage requires consent. Dogs, bikes, and children cannot consent.</p>
<p>I am not concerned that America is becoming a Godless state with no morals. If you want equal rights and protection under the law, everyone else must benefit, too. It is wrong to suggest that equality applies unevenly. Orwell said it best in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451526341/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0451526341&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=VHSNVVTJV2A2QCBZ">Animal Farm</a>, <em>&#8220;All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&#8221;</em> It is moral to be fair to others, even if those others are people who violate your religious beliefs. There are competing morals in this case, and America is choosing the more compassionate and the more just of the moral options.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a good thing. I celebrate marriage equality. I am also an Orthodox Jew and I would not perform a religious wedding ceremony that is not consistent with my understanding of Jewish law, including a gay marriage. Those two statements are not contradictory.</p>
<p>There is a long list of things that I think are very important to Orthodox Judaism. Banning gay marriage is near the bottom of the list. Kindness, compassion, and fairness are near the top of the list.</p>
<p>I understand that many Orthodox Jews have visceral fears about this gay marriage because of Jewish law. I hope we can get past those fears and move forward toward understanding and love.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an American, I am embarrassed by the entire Mozilla affair. To recap, the now ex-CEO of Mozilla, Brendan Eich, donated $1000 to a &#8220;Vote Yes on Prop 8&#8221; campaign. That means that on 2008 he was in favor of a law that would ban gay marriage. He was appointed CEO of Mozilla a couple of weeks ago. OK Cupid, a dating site, posted a pop-up notice on their website when a Mozilla Firefox (that&#8217;s the web browser developed by Mozilla and favored browser of Internet enthusiasts from 2010), that asked users to consider not using Firefox to protest the appointment of a Eich. Other Internet activists stoked the flames and eventually Eich voluntarily resigned.</p>
<p>This turn of events outraged a lot of people. The outrage crossed social and political lines. Conservatives, liberals, libertarians, gay activists, and individuals from pretty much every possible group joined in the disgust over what has transpired over the last few days. This has spawned many thoughtful articles and blog posts arguing that Eich did the right thing and the people who forced his hand were in the right.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s embarrassing for a lot of reasons. The obvious reasons for shame are the proliferation of terrible arguments, blatant hypocrisy, and lack of self-awareness being demonstrated.<span id="more-8307"></span></p>
<p>For example: The misuse of the right to free speech, the hypocrisy of only seeing how one side of this is free speech, the two-faced claim that it was wrong of OK Cupid to &#8220;censor&#8221; Firefox but then to boycott Mozilla because Eich stepped down, the misstatements of facts about Eich&#8217;s resignation, the invoking of the free market as a solution to problems and then crying when the free market doesn&#8217;t go their way, the crying about being bullied and then bullying others, the claims of tolerance and then not tolerating this, our reverence for the secret ballot and then publicizing campaign donations,  and the list goes on and on.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/0626c2d83673d8a8413b44a77aac7a7a.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8309" alt="0626c2d83673d8a8413b44a77aac7a7a" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/0626c2d83673d8a8413b44a77aac7a7a.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But as embarrassing as the saga has become, it is also quite intriguing to take a step back and analyze some of the tension between several competing policies at play. The right to free speech, the free market, free will, tolerance, tolerating intolerance, the measures of what constitutes intolerance, political issues vs. moral issues vs. personal beliefs, and perhaps most of all, the generation gap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/mozillas-gay-marriage-litmus-test-violates-liberal-values/360156/" target="_blank">As Conor Friedersdorf correctly points out in The Atlantic</a>, the majority of the state of California supported Prop 8 in 2008. The majority of the United States opposed gay marriage until circa 2012. Gay marriage has reached a bit of a tipping point. Most prognosticators presume that support for gay marriage will be overwhelming within the next few years. But it was not that long ago that gay marriage had very little support. In effect, Eich is being punished for taking a position that the majority of Americans held when he made his donation. More on this later.</p>
<p><a href="http://features.pewforum.org/same-sex-marriage-attitudes/slide2.php" target="_blank">The demographics of support for gay marriage bear this out</a>. Around 75% of Americans 18-29 support gay marriage. Among Baby Boomers, the number drops to 48% and in 2013 it was just 41%. Brendan Eich is 52. He was born at the tail end of the Baby Boomer generation. This is all very important. This means that to older Americans like Eich, gay marriage is a legitimate issue that hovers in the 60/40 and 50/50 range. It&#8217;s something that is debated and for every Boomer who opposes gay marriage, there is one Boomer who favors gay marriage. But by no means is it a settled issue for them. However, for young people, the numbers indicate that this is a very one sided issue. Those who oppose gay marriage are a significant minority. That means that it&#8217;s not really an issue that has two evenly balanced sides anymore in the minds of Millennials. As young people enter the work force and find a public voice, the public conversation will shift to reflect the views of a new generation. There are going to be growing pains. The tension of any seismic shift can cause an earthquake. On the Richter scale of social earthquakes, this was a 12.5.</p>
<p>I think this played a huge role in the Mozilla saga. Younger people have a hard time seeing gay marriage as a debatable issue. To Millennials, it&#8217;s almost like being in favor of racism. It&#8217;s simply not an issue up for discussion. So when young people, who I belive are disproportionately influential in Silicon Valley and the Internet Activist community are exposed to something that does not meet their threshold for legitimate debate, the result is outrage without nuance and without sensibility. I think this explains some of the blind rage and demand for blood.</p>
<p>There is a Orthodox Jewish angle here and it&#8217;s not the obvious one. If you think about it, Eich made his $1000 pledge when there was minimal social objection to supporting Prop 8. He is of a generation that is slowly adapting and changing its collective mind on gay marriage. But it is completely inappropriate to judge his donation or even his opposition to gay marriage from the perspective of a 27 year old. Eich didn&#8217;t grow up in the same world as that 27 year old. The 27 year old didn&#8217;t grow up in the same world as Eich. We share a planet and some common experiences and values, but in essence the world is a completely different place. <em>(I&#8217;ll be writing about some of these differences one of these days.)</em> It is not only unfair, but I think it might be immoral, to judge a 52 year old man with glasses of a person who lives in a different world. As the sages teach us in Ethics of Our Fathers, &#8220;Do not judge your fellow until you have stood in his place.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a 1:1 comparison, but there are some parallels in Orthodox Judaism. There are ideas, and freedoms, and rights that exist today that never existed at any time in history. The world is flatter than it has ever been. Diversity is not only accepted, it is revered and cherished. International discussions and debates are completely normal. Our grasp of history and science is unparalleled. It will certainly continue to improve, but as it stands now, an American school child should know more about the hard sciences and history than the greatest scholars of yesteryear. They were extremely handicapped by their lack of knowledge. We don&#8217;t blame them. We don&#8217;t insult them. We don&#8217;t look down on them. But if we are honest, we are forced to concede that the geniuses of ancient times or medieval times were on the ground floor. We are standing on their shoulders.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to judge our Torah giants with modern glasses. Even if we think our modern glasses are true and good and moral and Torah consistent, we cannot possibly expect anyone who was not given the blessing of information bestowed upon us to reconcile with our ideals. Yet, the Torah is somewhat malleable. It has adjusted in the past, especially with the imprimatur of the generation&#8217;s leaders and general public opinion. So let&#8217;s appreciate what we have for what it is. Let&#8217;s not be upset when it doesn&#8217;t meet our modern expectations. So much of great wisdom is eternal. It may need a little tweaking and fine tuning, but we are confident that our Torah, which has withstood the test of time, will endure.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no small thing. Whether it&#8217;s a secular debate, discussion about morality, or political issue, social conditions and environment play a gigantic role. Keeping this in mind can help dial back some of the outrage and open the door for improved communication and cooperation. But in order to talk, we need to understand each other. In order to appreciate the greats from our past, we need to understand them too.</p>
