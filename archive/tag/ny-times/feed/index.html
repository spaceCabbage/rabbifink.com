				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>There are quite a few approaches that religious people take in their attitude toward atheists and atheism. Three different ideas have been pitched or implemented in various outlets over the last couple of weeks. Seeing as so many of my fellow Jews are atheists, closeted or otherwise, I think it&#8217;s a question that contemporary Judaism must address.<span id="more-7721"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7722" alt="photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-600x449.jpg" /></p>
<p>A billboard in New York&#8217;s Times Square proclaims: <em>&#8220;To all of our atheist friends: Thank God you’re wrong.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cute line. It&#8217;s not very substantive and I see no chance of winning any atheists over with this kind of advertisement. It&#8217;s cool that God is getting a shout-out in Times Square. It&#8217;s definitely a lone voice among a very vocal majority of very unGodly advertisements and signage in that spot. But that&#8217;s the only value I can see in it.</p>
<p>The New York Times contrasted this billboard with a recent statement by the Pope: <em>“Given – and this is the fundamental thing – that God’s mercy has no limits, if He is approached with a sincere and repentant heart the question for those who do not believe in God is to abide by their own conscience. There is sin, also for those who have no faith, in going against one’s conscience. Listening to it and abiding by it means making up one’s mind about what is good and evil.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, I think the Pope is saying that actions are far more important than faith. This is particularly ironic coming from Catholicism which has traditionally placed such a great emphasis on belief. In fact, part of the Orthodox Jewish meme on Christianity is that they are all about faith while we are about action. (I&#8217;m not saying this is true. I am saying that this is taught.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a much more inclusive message than the billboard&#8217;s message. I think the Pope&#8217;s message will have a greater influence on positive social behavior than a snarky anti-atheist sign. It also increases the chances that a non-believer would care to be involved in religion. The Pope wins this one.</p>
<p>Rabbi Avi Shafran also proposed some billboards to promote Orthodox Judaism. His ideas: <em>What if, instead of special offers and glitzy offerings, we simply proclaimed loud and clear – in billboards and web ads and social media – that being a Jew, like it or not, precious fellow Jew, means being Divinely charged, that it means shouldering, whether it is always comfortable or not, responsibility ? And that ignoring that mandate is a reckless wasting of an opportunity to live a meaningful life by doing G-d’s will? That each of us has a stark and urgent choice: either to regard our lives as the brief opportunities to access eternity they are, or to waste one’s days in the pursuit of stuff and fun and “rights”?</em></p>
<p>I think this sounds more like the Times Square billboards than the Pope. While advertising our message is a great idea, I fear that advertising a hard line message is not going to win too many people over. I think that the approach largely depends on one&#8217;s goal. For some, the goal is that people join your movement. That&#8217;s a good goal if your movement is a good one. It also depends on whether people are amenable to your movements rules and regulations.</p>
<p>But Orthodox Judaism is not for everyone. It can be. But right now it is not. So perhaps we would be better off with a goal echoed by the Pope. We should be promoting positive, universal values that will help improve the world. Help people who might need a boost find something in their Judaism or other religious heritage that can help them in their lives.</p>
<p>There is so much that religion can offer people, even if they are not believers. Giving them those opportunities trumps snarky billboards and heavy handed pressure, in my opinion. Yes, we need to get the message out there. The question is what is that message.</p>
<p>I think the message is that religion and in particular Judaism can be beneficial to people no matter what they believe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>It was long assumed that fact checkers only served to correct erroneous information as a service to the public. However they were not thought to influence the truthfulness of politicians in general. In other words, it was assumed that politicians don&#8217;t lie less often because they are scared of being caught in a lie.</p>
<p>Today, the New York times reports on a study that shows that awareness of Politifact, a well known fact checking outfit, does in fact make a difference.</p>
<p><span id="more-7689"></span></p>
<p>In the study, over 1,000 politicians were sent letters by two professors. One group was reminded that Politifact was out there watching them and that lies would damage their career if the lies were exposed. The politicians sent return postcards acknowledging receipt of the letters. The second group were given a general statement telling them that the accuracy of their statements was being measured. A third group received no letters.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7690" alt="whistleblower" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/whistleblower-600x450.jpg" /></p>
<p>Significantly fewer politicians from group one made false statements than politicians from group two. Almost three times as many legislators from the second and third group made false statements. It seems that awareness of fact checking does indeed makes a difference.</p>
<p>Similarly, in our community there is a sense that bloggers are useless and just preaching to the choir. This might be true. But if the leadership is aware that they are being &#8220;fact checked&#8221; it seems that it will have an impact on policy and behavior. If so, there is a great benefit the J-Blogs are providing.</p>
<p>Fact checking leadership means asking tough questions. It can also mean exposing lies or untruths. Sometimes it means challenging conventional wisdom. Other times it means pointing out that a commonly held belief is not universally held in our tradition. There are many ways blogs fact check orthodox Judaism. It makes a difference.</p>
<p>Of course this requires leadership to be aware of the blogs. Some are. Some are not. But whistleblowers and dissenting opinions coming from the street are making a difference. Eventually, it will be impossible to continue to ignore their voice. But even if the issues raised are not specifically addressed, we can be sure that they are making a difference simply because they exist. People act differently when they know they are being watched and when errors are going to be exposed.</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter have given even more people a strong voice. But blogs will always be an important form of discourse and communication. It is on blogs that ideas are more thoroughly discussed and analyzed. Blog are also beneficiaries of Google. Search any Jewish topic and you&#8217;ll find blogs that have written on the subject.</p>
<p>The voice of the J-Blogosphere can be confusing, annoying, angry, cynical, unpopular, and negative. But it also serves the very important purpose of fact checkers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The NY Times reports that there is a religious group that is losing even some of its most committed members because of what they are finding on the Internet. Sound familiar? The group is not orthodox Judaism, rather it is the Mormons.</p>
<p>Some people are quick to point out that orthodox Judaism is suffering a similar fate. According to the narrative, people get online, they see that their religion can be challenged and that there are many other perspectives in the world, and sometimes they leave. We discussed this in the context of the chasidic world here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>)</p>
<p>Mormons are finding that their religion is so nascent, their beliefs are based on so many contradictions and inconsistencies, and their prophet was a less than admirably role model, that their faith is irrevocably shaken. Some leave. Others stay and want to modernize it.<span id="more-7410"></span></p>
<p>In the context of chasidic Judaism I think the comparison is somewhat fair. The lifestyle is a fairly recent innovation, the beliefs can seem contradictory at times, and for some, finding out that a shtreimel is not holy can shake their faith. The Internet might be &#8220;to blame&#8221; for those people discovering that they have options.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7411" alt="google_1674887b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/google_1674887b-600x375.jpg" /></p>
<p>But I think most people who leave and use the Internet as a tool to assist them in their journey are bothered by social issues in the community. They dislike the lifestyle, or they think the leadership is corrupt, or the allure of freedom from religion is too great. For them, the Internet is more like a lobby where they can meet likeminded people. The Internet doesn&#8217;t cause the doubt, but it helps them deal with it and sometime it helps them leave.</p>
<p>The last few days have demonstrated another Internet driven issue in orthodox Judaism.  A local issue can become a global issue. A rabbi who writes controversial things becomes international news. Further, the materials that form the substance of his controversial statements are available for anyone to read. The challenges can be found on plenty of websites. The charges of heresy can be found on several websites as well.</p>
<p>However there is a disconnect. The Internet is the great liberator of minds. Being told what to think doesn&#8217;t really work anymore. Anyone can do their own research. In fact, R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s original article was using data that was a week old and required a simple click to verify if it was current. Obviously people called him on it. It&#8217;s so easy to do research today. We can verify and fact check and myth bust with ease. If a yeshiva student in the Mir circa 1967 wanted to read Biblical Criticism, where would he even go? But now, it&#8217;s all available. Google is a click away. People can read it for themselves. That was the thinking behind <a href="http://thetorah.com" target="_blank">TABS</a>. Provide a safe place to read Biblical Criticism in the context of orthodox Judaism. R&#8217; Farber was trying do that. Did he go too far? Is there such a thing as too far? These are the questions being addressed across the Internet right now.</p>
<p>The point is that drawing lines in the sand while expecting skeptics to just &#8220;listen&#8221; is so 1980s. It doesn&#8217;t work anymore. People can just look at the information and make their own determination. Perhaps many of these people are not qualified to make such judgments. But that doesn&#8217;t stop them.</p>
<p>While it is laudable that Cross-Currents is trying to address this issue, in my opinion they are not addressing it at all. Instead we are being told what to think without being told why. The only why we have heard is that if we think like R&#8217; Farber there will be dire consequences. Is that sufficient? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The Internet is not going away. The questions that R&#8217; Farber addressed will be on the Internet forever. And there are more. The best defense I have seen so far is on TABS. The reason it is the best is because is simply because it is the only defense so far. We can lament the lack of scholars in the frum community willing to address these questions in the terms they are asked. But all we have to show for it are lamentations. Still no answers or explanations.</p>
<p>From the NY Times article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mr. Mattsson said that when he started sharing what he had learned with other Mormons in Sweden, the stake president (who oversees a cluster of congregations) told him not to talk about it to any members, even his wife and children. He did not obey: “I said to them, why are you afraid for the truth?”</em></p>
<p>We say we have the truth. We should be trying to figure out how to reconcile it with other truths, not saying &#8220;we have the truth&#8221; so loudly that we are incapable of hearing anything else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>There was a great article in the NY Times last week about nostalgia. I believe that nostalgia is a very important element of the religious experience. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/21/the-magical-secret-of-the-seder/">The Magical Secret of the Seder</a>)</p>
<p>I had no idea that until recently nostalgia was considered a mental disorder. Apparently, it was thought to be akin to depression. But people who were nostalgic were not sad and so research commenced to determine the proper classification and function of nostalgia.</p>
<p>It turns out that nostalgia is actually pretty useful. Studies have shown that nostalgia can make people feel happier, can physically warm the body, can give people hope, and overall improve one&#8217;s life. This all serves very important evolutionary purposes. Modernly, it helps with relationships in general and in particular with marriage. Good memories make for good relationships.<span id="more-7393"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7394" alt="V7K1cJRPaafgLZP" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/V7K1cJRPaafgLZP-600x450.jpg" /></p>
<p>Looking at nostalgia through the lens of the religious person, nostalgia becomes even more useful. If our religion gives us good memories and makes us feel good when we are young it is going to be important to us to relive those memories year to year and life event to life event. Even more importantly, it motivates us to give our children similar experiences. We want our children to look fondly upon their youth and we want religion to be front and center in their positive memories.</p>
<p>I think we should cultivate good memories. We should create our own nostalgia. We should actively mine those memories for good feelings towards people, family, spouses, and of course religion. Jewish holidays are perfect for this kind of work but really it should be a full time effort.</p>
<p>All this leads me to two issues that are plaguing the orthodox Jewish community right now.</p>
<p>Victims of sex abuse invoke many coping mechanisms to deal with the betrayal and violence of the crimes perpetrated against them. Obviously, if the abuser is an authority or religious figure, the victim&#8217;s associations with religion become supremely negative. There is little religious nostalgia for victims. Even worse, is when the coping mechanism involves repressing memories of one&#8217;s childhood. Some victims cannot even remember their childhood. Clearly, these victims have no nostalgia towards their religion. They may stay in the fold for other reasons, but an important part of their religious experience is left with a gaping hole instead of positive memories. Aside from robbing children of their innocence and inflicting untold pain of their victims, predators paint over their victim&#8217;s childhood memories with a very big, very dark brush. This has many negative consequences, including religious consequences.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have witnessed there is a recent spate of <i>baalei teshuva </i>returning to their prior lives and leaving orthodox Judaism. This group also lacks the nostalgia of an orthodox Jewish upbringing. This is not a defect. It can be a difference that does not make a distinction. But for some people, it can be hard to stay in the orthodox Jewish community and for some of those people nostalgia is a decent motivating factor. Unfortunately, those who choose to become orthodox later in life lack this secret weapon. Sometimes that can make all the difference in the world between staying or leaving.</p>
<p>The article in the NY Times corroborates what I think is a very underappreciated part of being an orthodox Jew. Nostalgia. Those who are missing it, whether because of despicable violence or courage to choose orthodox Judaism are often missing this non-essential ingredient. But we all have the power to give it to our children and I contend that it&#8217;s a very worthwhile endeavor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Meditation was once an oddity reserved for spiritual extremists. Today, meditation is as American as apple pie.</p>
<p>There are many good reasons to do meditation. The NY Times enumerates several of the benefits that have been demonstrated by science. Improved leadership and productivity can be attributed to meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation has a place in Judaism as well. Many great Jewish thinkers have described Jewish prayer as a form of meditation. The prophets of yore achieved their heightened spiritual state after intense meditation. There are pious chasidic men (and maybe some women) who meditate alone in the Jerusalem Forest on a regular basis. For us, meditation is a word to describe an activity whose end is to achieve some state of nirvana. It could even be argued that making blessings before eating food or enjoying any other physical pleasure is a variation of mindfulness.<span id="more-7348"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7349 alignright" alt="meditation-6" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/meditation-6-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The NY Times reports that there is a reason that Buddha favored meditation. Buddha&#8217;s teachings were to end suffering. Meditation was intended to serve as a way of freeing one&#8217;s mind of the negative thoughts we have about others. The idea was to bring people together through the heightened state of awareness.</p>
<p>This is a lofty claim and it was put to the test by the author of the NY Times article, profesor of psychology Dr. David DeSteno. He and his lab conducted controlled experiments to determine if meditation had an impact on empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>The results? Incredibly, or maybe not, meditation actually helped a significant portion of test subjects feel empathetic. It works!</p>
<p>DeSteno concludes that while the fringe benefits are great, when one meditates one should be mindful of its original purpose. Hopefully if we can channel that power we can alleviate the pain of division and hate.</p>
<p>I can think of no message more appropriate for Rosh Chodesh Av. This time of year we are exhorted to work on our interpersonal skills. Perhaps it would be wise to spend some time in meditation to give ourselves an assist on this seasonal challenge.</p>
<p>The article also got me thinking about doing Mitzvos to reap the social benefits of the act or even to reap an alternative benefit that was certainly unintended. Sometimes people lament the new-agey interpretations of Mitzvos and modern understandings of their social benefits. True, it can feel uncomfortable, but I think it&#8217;s noteworthy that we find similar hand wringing with regard to meditation. DeSteno is a bit uncomfortable with using meditation to get ahead instead of using it to unite. I think we can relate to that.</p>
<p>Finally, one can imagine how vindicated followers of Buddha must feel. As orthodox Jews, we feel the same way some our traditions and teachings are corroborated by modern discoveries. I know I love when that happens, so I am sure the study mentioned in this article will bring similar feelings of euphoria to students of Buddha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7292" alt="MATZOH-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>The NY Times must be learning Daf Yomi. Just when we all started learning about the laws of chametz and matzah, the Times runs a front page above the fold story on Satmar A (as opposed to Satmar Z) protocols for matzah baking. It seems that Satmar A, and maybe others I really don&#8217;t know, are not satisfied with the &#8220;<em>shmura m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; and add an extra layer of stringency. They are careful to use wheat that did not even become wet while it was growing. They grow wheat on a far flung farm in Arizona where there is no rain for months while the wheat grows.</p>
<p>Why do they do this?</p>
<p>Halacha requires that we use &#8220;Shmurah Matzah&#8221; at the Seder (and some authorities say all Pesach). Shmura Matzah is not synonymous with round, dark matzah. Matzah can be Shmurah and any shape. Shmurah means that the ingredients for the Matzah were watched to ensure that the grains did not become leaven by coming in contact with water and not being baked within 18 minutes. There are three opinions in halacha as to when the ingredients for matzah must be &#8220;watched&#8221; in order to qualify for &#8220;Shmurah Matzah.&#8221; The most &#8220;watched&#8221; that halacha requires in that the wheat be watched from the time of harvesting. That is why most Matzah says &#8220;<em>Shmurah m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; &#8211; watched from the time of reaping.</p>
<p>There are no opinions in halacha that require that the grains not come in contact with water before they are reaped. None that I could find at least.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on here?<span id="more-7290"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times tells us exactly what is going on here. Here is what Professor Samuel Heilman has to say:</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;the competition between the two Satmar groups — each led by one of two brothers — was about one-upmanship.</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“One is always looking to be more authoritative than the other,” Professor Heilman said, “and one of the ways they’re making this happen is over matzo — our matzo is more kosher than yours, we’re more scrupulous and careful over matzo baking than you are.”</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">One-upmanship in halacha. Nailed it. When so many of us are mitzvah observant we need to do things to signal to others that we are different. We are better. That signal is the extra level of stringency that is completely unnecessary. For more on this social phenomenon check this out: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/19/suggestion-read-judaism-as-a-first-language-right-now/">Judaism as a First Language</a></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">But I think there is something more happening here. While it is true that there may be nothing wrong with being extra stringent, this kind of stringency borders on silliness. The concern that created the requirement to use Shmurah Matzah is that the wheat will actually become chametz. If water comes in contact with flour while it is in storage the wheat can become chametz. That&#8217;s science. But it is literally impossible for grains that are still growing to become Chametz. Impossible. In much the same way that it is impossible for cooked matzah to become chametz if it comes in contact with liquid. Yet, there are thousands of Jews who don&#8217;t eat <em>gebrukst </em>because of that very concern.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Adding stringencies like <em>gebrukst</em> and growing wheat where there is no rain only makes sense in one context. If Judaism is a magical, mystical, mystery and our rational minds are useless to understand the laws of Judaism then it does not matter that there is no possibility of becoming chametz. All that matters is that water and wheat do not come in contact ever. Even if the prohibition is against chametz and not all wheat and water become chametz it does not matter. But if Judaism is a religion with Divine instructions that are supposed to be understood as rationally as possible and the rules tell us what our concerns are supposed to be, there is not place for non-sensical stringencies.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">When it comes to chametz, we are given specific instructions as to what the prohibition entails. The law requires us to be careful not to let the wheat and water ferment and begin to rise. It&#8217;s based on science. Anything that could help prevent that from happening is a reasonable stringency. But once we get into the kind of stringencies that will not prevent a violation of a prohibition, it is hard to see their value unless we say something magical is happening and that wheat and water may never touch. The thing is, that&#8217;s not what the Torah, Talmud, Shulchan Aruch, and responsa tell us. To them, it has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do mysticism.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Now I think I can understand why the NY Times found this so interesting. Growing wheat in Arizona so it doesn&#8217;t rain on the wheat? It&#8217;s irrational. It is religion without reason. It&#8217;s exotic, archaic, and mystical. It&#8217;s not the Judaism that so many of us practice. It&#8217;s a Judaism that almost purposely does not make rational sense and is purely mystical. That&#8217;s front page news.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/liar.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7257" alt="liar" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/liar-300x292.jpg" width="300" height="292" /></a>One of the primary concerns in the orthodox Jewish community when discussing the issue of reporting sex abuse to the authorities is that inevitably there will be false accusations that will ruin the lives of innocent people. It is very scary to think that someone can be named as an abuser and before any evidence is presented the accused can be found guilty in the court of public opinion. In a community where the main currency is reputation and communal standing false accusations can have drastic consequences.</p>
<p>This is a good reason not to judge people before the facts are known and also a good argument against placing too much stock in reputation. Changing our approach on these issues would go a long way to making our communities safer places.</p>
<p>Whether concern over false accusations is a legitimate reason to require rabbinic approval before going to the authorities is a discussion for another time. I don&#8217;t see why should be any different than other non-orthodox Jewish communities, but again, not the discussion here.</p>
<p>The NY Times has a very (appropriately) one-sided article on the Baruch Lebovits and Sam Kellner situation.<span id="more-7256"></span> In short, Lebovits is a known sex abuser, he molested Kellner&#8217;s son, Kellner got permission from a rabbinic court to pursue Lebovits in criminal proceedings, and Lebovits was convicted. Kellner was a hero and symbol of strength in the victims advocates community. Then Kellner was convicted of obstruction for allegedly offering money for testimony and threatening to extort Lebovitz&#8217;s family. Kellner was charged and to add insult to injury, Lebovits&#8217;s conviction was overturned. He awaits retrial.</p>
<p>The Times quotes a rabbi who advised Kellner to go to the authorities as saying that if Kellner goes to jail it will have the effect of preventing future victims from coming forward. It&#8217;s hard enough to come forward in the community but it will be even harder if a strong advocate for victims of abuse finds himself in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>The merits of Kellner&#8217;s case notwithstanding, I think it could be argued that a conviction of Kellner would have the opposite effect. If one concern with reporting abuse to the authorities is the fear of false accusations, it is possible that seeing Kellner&#8217;s troubles with the law could mitigate this fear. Clearly, the law does not take kindly to those who are deceptive or dishonest when reporting allegations of abuse. Thus it stands to reason that we need not be terribly concerned that false allegations would occur frequently.</p>
<p>The Brian Banks case illustrates this same idea. Banks was a rising college football star when he plead guilty to rape. The accuser admitted to lying after Banks sat in jail for several years. Banks was released and now his accuser is being sued for millions of dollars. She will probably lose too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that Banks was falsely accused and proponents of rabbinic go-betweens might point to the case to show how dangerous it can be to just go to the authorities without an independent investigation. However, the fact that the false accuser stands to lose millions of dollars in civil court, not to mention possible criminal prosecution actually serves as a huge deterrent. Certainly these kinds of consequences to false accusations will serve as a barrier to future false accusations.</p>
<p>The point is that false accusations happen from time to time. But when they do happen there are severe consequences. It&#8217;s unlikely that people would be willing to risk suffering those severe consequences when there is no basis for their accusation. We should not be afraid that these stories will chill allegations of abuse in our community. We should use these stories as examples of the fidelity of the criminal justice system and hopefully our community will encourage victims of abuse to come forward without being overly concerned with false accusations so that we can get to fixing this problem as quickly as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7112" alt="conspiracy-theory-alert" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert-300x262.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a>One would think that the Internet would be good for at least one thing. It should help debunk conspiracies. After all, all one needs to do is do a little Googling to find out if there are actual facts to support a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Compared with the pre-Internet dark ages, it would seem to be much easier to debunk conspiracies. But in fact the opposite is true. Conspiracies proliferate on the Internet. People find confirmation for their ideas on the Internet, no matter how crazy the ideas may be, and so the Internet provides more fuel to the fire of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>The NY Times published an article trying to explain why rational people believe in conspiracies and what kind of people believe in conspiracies.</p>
<p>It seems that the primary factors of conspiracy theorists are cynicism about the world, cynicism about politics, low self-worth, and a feeling of powerlessness. In other words, believing in conspiracies may be a defense mechanism against these sorts of feelings. Correlation does not equal causation, obviously, but there is some reasoning behind this as well.</p>
<p>When people feel like they have little say in the world and they feel that the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; they can regain some semblance of control by claiming to have inside information and a broader understanding of what is happening in the world.<span id="more-7111"></span></p>
<p>Reacting to the news that a formerly chasidic woman lost custody of her children, many people see a conspiracy. They see a judge that is biased because she is bought by chasidic groups. Or they see a a judge who favors a religious home over a secular home. Or they see a judge who is afraid to stand up to a very powerful chasidic community. All of these things are possible. However, there are also legitimate reasons she lost custody.</p>
<p>Seeing things that may or may not be there to support an overarching narrative is conspiracy-like. It also fits in well with the typology of people who buy into a conspiracy. Many of the people buying into the conspiracy are ex-hasids who are cynical about the chasidic world (rightfully so!), may feel marginalized by that world (they are), and are certainly likely to feel powerless in that world. It&#8217;s empowering to have an overarching narrative to explain what happened.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that there is a conspiracy, but I don&#8217;t think it is supported by the facts that I read. I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone for trying to advocate on the mother&#8217;s behalf and I support those who do not want courts to include any religious considerations in custody proceedings. But I think there is a reason</p>
<p>I think this can also relate to people who buy into <em>segulos</em> and magical mystical mystery thinking. People who are cynical about the world because of anti-Semitism or theologically based xenophobia, who feel powerless because the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; or because there are dark forces that are making things difficult, are prime candidates to turn to solutions not based in reality. They will use &#8220;spiritual&#8221; cures for illness or everyday superstition or they turn to snake oil salesmen pitching salvation for the same reasons people believe in conspiracies. I think they are very similar.</p>
<p>In politics I think this bears out as well. <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/05/oklahoma-tornado-conspiracy-theories/65499/" target="_blank">People who think President Obama made the tornado</a> with a fancy weather maker to distract from current political scandals match some of these factors. They think Obama is out to get them. They think that they are doomed. They think they are powerless to stop Obama. So they turn to conspiracy theories to empower themselves as the ones who &#8220;get it&#8221;.</p>
<p>As we learn more about the brain we will learn more about why people think the way they do. We live in exciting times. Although, I am concerned that the NY Times is a conspiracy newspaper written by Jews to achieve world domination. You can read about it in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. (Just kidding!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jerusalem051013_001-4_3_rx1443_c1920x1440.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7076" alt="jerusalem051013_001-4_3_rx1443_c1920x1440" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jerusalem051013_001-4_3_rx1443_c1920x1440-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Last night, I was asked by Zev Brenner what I thought of the Women of the Wall vs. the Women for the Wall. I sidestepped the question on the radio but these are my thoughts.</em></p>
<p>Rosh Chodesh is supposed to be a day of renewal for the Jewish people and a special day in recognition of Jewish women. This past Rosh Chodesh at the Kotel women engaged in a fierce turf war.</p>
<p>For several years the Women of the Wall have held their Rosh Chodesh service at the Kotel. They wear prayer shawls, some wear tefillin, and they read from the Torah. This violated the rules of the Kotel and arrests were routinely made. The Israel courts determined that these rules were illegal and the Women of the Wall looked forward to a peaceful service, finally. But it was not to be. A new group called the Woman for the Wall who support traditional orthodox Judaism and oppose the Women of the Wall organized a huge counter protest.<span id="more-7075"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Heeding calls from their rabbis, religious teenage girls turned up in large numbers to protest the group’s insistence on praying at the wall in religious garb traditionally worn by men. The girls crammed the women’s section directly in front of the wall by 6:30 a.m., forcing the liberal women to conduct their prayer service farther back on the plaza. There, hundreds of police officers locked arms in cordons to hold back throngs of black-hatted Orthodox men who whistled, catcalled, and threw water, candy and a few plastic chairs.</em></p>
<p>There were thousands of people there. I am sure that most of them were well behaved. I am sure that only a few of them contributed to the mayhem. But I am also sure that some people made fools out of themselves and a few even got arrested.</p>
<p>At this point, the issue of Women and the Wall has been so needlessly escalated that it seems unlikely a resolution will be reached. When I think about what has happened over the last few months I feel sad. I feel sad because this didn&#8217;t have to happen. Most of this is senseless outrage and manufactured controversy.</p>
<p>Go back a few months. Imagine the Kotel authority just looked the other way when a small group of women prayed in a different way than the other women. The Women of the Wall were not proselytizing, they were not trying to win converts, they were not trying to make a revolution at the Kotel. They just wanted to pray the way they like to pray. Is it the way orthodox Jewish women pray? Not usually. Is it halachically acceptable? Barely. But there is definitely room to allow it. The Women of the Wall would be a small blip on the Kotel radar as they have been for several years now. Especially now that the court sided in their favor, this Rosh Chodesh would have passed with little fanfare. The Women of the Wall would have done their thing without threat of arrest and no one would have been in the news or in jail.</p>
<p>Instead a massive counter protest was manufactured. Not too many people seemed bothered by the small group of Women of the Wall. No one really felt so outraged that they needed to do something about it. People noticed, or didn&#8217;t notice, and that was it. No big deal. Until last week. Until people were told to care, they didn&#8217;t. As was appropriate.</p>
<p>The organizers tapped into the two things that are guaranteed to draw big numbers: Daas Torah and paranoia about non-orthodox Jews. The rabbis said to go protest and so they went to protest. The pretext for the protest was that the Women of the Wall were out to uproot the sanctity of the Kotel and over time they were out to erode the very essence of orthodox Judaism. If that sounds crazy, it&#8217;s because it is. How can a few dozen women carry so much power? Why do the ultra-orthodox even care what they are doing? I don&#8217;t have the answer to that question and I have yet to see a satisfactory answer from anyone else.</p>
<p>They should have been left alone. Instead, thousands of people came to the Kotel on Friday and turned it into a battleground. And for what? Is there really any legitimate fear that charedi Judaism is in danger of being subverted by a few dozen women? Are we so paranoid, so insecure about our <em>frumkeit?</em> Is seeing some women praying in non-traditional ways such a danger?</p>
<p>The part that hurts me the most is that these women are not sinning, they are praying! While many may not agree with the manner in which they are praying, it boggles the mind that orthodox Jews would stifle prayer at the Kotel or anywhere for that matter. If we really believe that prayer is a mitzvah, and praying brings us closer to God, why would we deny others the same opportunity?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like the Women of the Wall are fornicating, <em>chas v&#8217;shalom, </em>at the Kotel. They are praying. We should be encouraging them. We should be impressed with their dedication to their prayers. We should be taking note that non-orthodox Jews can also be religious. Instead we are scared of them and their ideas. We let our fear turn into hate and violence. Our public statement to the world is that we cannot allow anyone to pray in a way that makes us a tad uncomfortable. In the end, I think this says a lot more about us than it says about them.</p>
<p>It is sad that it has come to this. Jew against Jew. One groups seeking the right to pray and the other doing their best to stop them. The script has been flipped. This is not a proud moment for us.</p>
<p>Tensions are high. Anger and rhetoric is escalating. I hope we can find within ourselves to cool off a bit, take a step back, and try to find common ground with the Women of the Wall. Maybe we can even see that it&#8217;s possible that God is smiling, <em>k&#8217;vyachol,</em> over these women who may not be as orthodox as some of us, but are yearning to connect to Him in the best way that they know how.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/world/middleeast/plan-to-resolve-western-wall-prayer-controversy.html?_r=1&amp;"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6923" alt="ISRAEL-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ISRAEL-articleLarge-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>All hail Natan Sharansky, peacemaker. We hope.</p>
<p>The world has become witnesses to a very public and somewhat embarrassing battle over the Kotel. Although instead of the familiar disagreements between Palestinians and Israelis, this scuffle pitted Jew against Jew.</p>
<p>The Kotel is maintained by orthodox Jews who would like to preserve an atmosphere that is similar to orthodox synagogues and everything that entails. Many find attempts by women to lead small prayer services offensive. The women prayer services are often led by Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall. Hoffman has been arrested several times for leading such services and for the severe offense of wearing a particular kind of tallit.</p>
<p>The conflict was escalating and becoming more and more ugly with each passing arrest. More orthodox Jews cast aspersion toward Hoffman and more liberal minding Jews stood behind her.</p>
<p>The Forward first reported a breakthrough in negotiations headed by Natan Sharansky. The NY Times spoke with Sharansky and describes the plan:<span id="more-6922"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mr. Sharansky’s proposal involves expanding and improving the areas accessible for prayer at the wall to include the southern section known as Robinson’s Arch which, under his plan, would be open for Jews wishing to pray in a less Orthodox, more egalitarian style 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The main prayer section, which is now divided into men’s and women’s sections, would remain the domain of more traditional worshippers.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me!</p>
<p>Sharansky has close to ties to my family and my shul. My great uncle was responsible for his release from Soviet prison (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Greenwald#Natan_Sharansky" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) and Sharansky&#8217;s daughter married a young man who grew up in my shul. His father, <strong>Alan Danziger</strong>, is the president of Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>Alan told me that Sharansky was charged with coming up with a solution and he (jokingly) asked my advice. I suggested a three section Kotel (men, women, egalitarian) with each group getting use of the best area in the northenmost corner of the Kotel once in a while. I also thought it wise to have non-orthodox Jews participate in the administration of the Kotel.</p>
<p>So I am very pleased with the proposal. It&#8217;s not exactly what I suggested, but close enough. I really hope all parties will agree. The NY Times reports that Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall are not completely satisfied with the plan <em>&#8220;but we will compromise. You don’t always have to be right, you have to be smart, and compromise is a sign of maturity and understanding what’s at stake here.”</em></p>
<p>Compromise is good. Let&#8217;s hope everyone will be willing to accept this proposal.</p>
<p>Some have argued that people who are not comfortable with the current orthodox arrangements at the Kotel are few in number and they are too few to matter. I think this is ludicrous. Perhaps if more people were made to feel comfortable at our Holiest place, more people who are not orthodox sympathetic would come to the Kotel to pray and be inspired.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that is a good result.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6830" alt="Pesach meal" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pesach-meal-300x197.jpg" width="300" height="197" />For most Jews, Passover is a pilgrimage. Instead of the pilgrimage of our forefathers to the Temple Mount, today we make a pilgrimage to our parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces, cousins, aunts, and uncles or some combination thereof. The holiday of Pesach as we call it, or the Holiday of Matzos as it is called in the Torah, or the Time of our Freedom and Holiday of the Spring as the day is known to the rabbis of the Talmud, could be said to have been supplanted by a new name, the Holiday of Family.</p>
<p>They say that one of the secrets of happy couples is that they share wonderful memories together. The combination of the experience and the positive memory associated with the common experience creates an environment where a good relationship can flourish.</p>
<p>I advise couples to actively try to create good memories. Do things together that are fun and exciting. Plan activities that will create those memories. And reminisce. Always look fondly upon those moments, cherish the memories, and plan more memory making merriment.<span id="more-6829"></span></p>
<p>This may sound a bit like cheating. It&#8217;s almost like artificially manufacturing a relationship. But it&#8217;s not cheating. It&#8217;s playing smart. No relationship can survive on the fumes of romance or even true love with no help. You need to stoke the flames, you need to create a common language, you need to have good memories.</p>
<p>Religion is a lot like a relationship.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways of transmitting a love and excitement about Judaism is by creating good Jewish memories and associations. Nostalgia plays a large role in our lives. A song takes us back to our teenage angst, a smell takes us back to a vacation, an old friend takes us back to simpler times. When we are down, there&#8217;s nothing quite like Mom&#8217;s cooking to make everything all good again.</p>
<p>While religion must grow into something more sophisticated and mature than simple nostalgia, leveraging the natural feelings of nostalgia is a great way to augment one&#8217;s spirituality. After all, God gave us nostalgia. Let us use it.</p>
<p>The Seder is the perfect time to craft those memories. The smells, tastes, customs, and discussions of the Seder will linger decades after we sing Chad Gadya at the conclusion of our Seder. The content of the Haggadah and what we are able to learn and find inspirational during the Seder is so important, but the flavor and tone of our Seder will make a lasting impact as well. Who joins in our Seder will make a difference too. When we associate our family, and good feelings with the Seder, we have a formula that can create memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no shame in trying to create those memories. In fact, I encourage it. Make the Seder special. Make the Seder consistent.  Make the Seder a time for family. Make your own family traditions.</p>
<p>The story of the Exodus is as much a story of salvation as it is a story of becoming a family. We experienced an incredible exodus together and it bonded us together as a family. We relive those memories every year. This is one of the great ideas in the Haggadah. But we must also create our own new memories.</p>
<p>A New York Times article published last week drives home a similar message. The article proposes that <em>&#8220;The single most important thing you can do for your family may be the simplest of all: develop a strong family narrative.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This is a clumsy way of saying that families need to know their story. Families that are happiest know answers to questions like these: <em>Do you know where your grandparents grew up? Do you know where your mom and dad went to high school? Do you know where your parents met? Do you know an illness or something really terrible that happened in your family? Do you know the story of your birth?</em></p>
<p>Our stories and our collective memories create strong families. Strong families foster confident, well-adjusted, happy children. This is wisdom found in a New York Times article in 2013. It is also found in our ancient Seder traditions. Even before the formal Seder was established, the Torah itself tells us to tell our children our story. We are charged with mastering our national narrative. So many of our rituals come back to the same point &#8211; &#8220;because God took us out of Egypt&#8221;. This is our way of reminded ourselves of our family story. It is so important that the Torah mentions it dozens of times.</p>
<p>One of the secrets of Judaism is our story telling. We read the stories in the Bible every week. Our Talmud is stock full of stories of our sages. Stories are one of the languages of Judaism. The Seder is a time to tell the story of our forefather, but is also the time to write our own, new stories.</p>
<p>This year, and every year, let us use the Holiday of Family, Pesach with its Seder to retell our national story and the birth of our nation, but also to write new chapters in our own family stories and create positive memories and associations with our religious experiences. In this way we will do our part in passing our beautiful tradition to the future of Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6703" alt="jonathan-sacks" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jonathan-sacks-300x172.jpg" width="300" height="172" />In yesterday&#8217;s New York Times, Rabbi Sacks is a featured Op-Ed contributor. His article, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/opinion/the-moral-animal.html" target="_blank">The Moral Animal</a> has been at the top of the Most Emailed and near the top of the Most Viewed lists for a couple days now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beautifully written article. I think Rabbi Sacks is really onto something here. He basically argues that the survival of good, kind, compassionate religion is a function of a quasi-evolution. We are hard wired for empathy and altruism. But we are also hard wired to survive and act selfishly. Religion functions as a way of helping us maintain balance or even tip the scales in favor of empathy and altruism.</p>
<p>He uses some fancy neuroscience to support his premise and I am certainly not qualified to comment on that aspect of the article.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sacks concludes that &#8220;religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age&#8221; and we cannot allow the West to &#8220;lose their sense of God&#8221;. Rabbi Sacks is correct that good religion is good for society. We need to foster and promote that kind of religion. Kind, compassionate, caring about everyone and greasing the wheels of humanity to push the world forward. Sometimes religion does the opposite of that. Rabbi Sacks is trying to showcase the softer, more humanistic side of religion and I support that completely. We need to emphasize that kind of religion in our religious communities and in the public eye.<span id="more-6702"></span></p>
<p>Also, as <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2012/12/25/nothing-to-be-nervous-about-neuroscience/" target="_blank">Rabbi Adlerstein pointed out</a>, there is no fear of science detectable in Rabbi Sacks&#8217; article. Everything science teaches us can be used to glorify God and increase our appreciation for the world God gave us.</p>
<p>I really like the article and only have one small complaint.</p>
<p>I wish that Rabbi Sacks would open the door for non-believers to be included in his article. In other words, Rabbi Sacks is implying that those without religion are doomed because their selfishness is bound to control them and eventually it could control and ultimately destroy society.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we need to be so apocalyptic.</p>
<p>The mission of the Jewish People is to be a light to the nations. I think it is fallacious to assume that this requires everyone to be religious or Christian, or Muslim, Hindu, or even Jewish. It means that the lessons of good, empathetic, progressive religion are universal and should become the standard for the entire world. But with good religious people leading the way, it is not necessary for everyone else to be religious to  integrate those important lessons. Good, kind, atheists also need to be part of the conversation.</p>
<p>We should be saying something very similar to what Rabbi Sacks is saying, but a little bit broader. We should be saying that all people must find ways to develop their empathy and altruism. If religion is your path, that&#8217;s great. If you choose another path, that is also fine. Our primary concern is not the religious choices or observances, but that the lessons and strength of good religion should not become extinct. It&#8217;s clear that non-religious people will be a huge part of the future and I think it is a mistake to exclude them from this conversation.</p>
<p>I love Rabbi Sacks&#8217; message, I just think it needs to be a bit broader.</p>
<p><em>Stay tuned tomorrow for a post that investigates this issue a bit further.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iStock_000001134236XSmall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6590" title="you" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iStock_000001134236XSmall-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>A landscape shifting case was recently decided in Oregon. The court decided that the prosecution has the burden of proof to show that eyewitness testimony is reliable. This means that when a witness testifies, the jury does not need to assume the testimony is accurate. Rather, the prosecution must show that there were no factors that would make the testimony suspect.</p>
<p>The court based its reasoning on significant scientific evidence that has shown that we don&#8217;t always remember things as well as we think. We are very susceptible to the power of suggestion, especially from authority. Also, witnessing a crime can be a very traumatic event and our eyes and minds don&#8217;t function perfectly under those conditions.</p>
<p>The most confounding thing about misidentification is that our eyes and mind are so good at convincing us that we saw that we saw. Even when we are presented with evidence to the contrary we trust our own unreliable sight and memory over better evidence. Juries are no different. They also place too much weight on eye-witness testimony. It is almost like a Holy Grail of evidence but in reality it is extremely unreliable.<span id="more-6589"></span></p>
<p>I worked on a case where an &#8220;eyewitness&#8221; testified that he &#8220;saw&#8221; the defendant running for his life (he had just allegedly shot someone) from 100 yards away across a very busy street from <em>inside a cafe! </em>Unless this guy had Superman&#8217;s Supervision, it would be impossible for him to see and identify the person in question. Yet, the jury was convinced that he was a reliable witness and perhaps more incredibly, <em>he was convinced </em>that he was being truthful.</p>
<p>Under the new rules in Oregon, the jury would be instructed to be skeptical of such testimony unless they were convinced he was an accurate witness.</p>
<p>The meta significance of this ruling is that the courts were willing to discard their &#8220;tradition&#8221; in favor of science. Tradition has always told us to trust our eyes and trust the eyes of others. If we see something we can be sure that it&#8217;s true. But the science says otherwise. The science says that our eyes play tricks on us. Our memories are fuzzy and vulnerable to suggestion. In short, despite what we&#8217;ve thought for so long, our eyes do deceive us. For the courts to place a stake in the ground and reverse the conventional thinking in favor of new science is worth acknowledging.</p>
<p>I think this is hinted at in Jewish law as well. We have an obligation to judge people favorably. The Talmud says that if you &#8220;see someone who has sinned&#8221; you should not judge them unfavorably as well. Granted, other reasons have been supplied to explain this rule. But I think it fits in well with what we now know about &#8220;what we see&#8221;. That is, we cannot be sure what we have seen is real or true and thus it seems inappropriate to judge others simply based on what we have seen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jonah_logo_main_e_large.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6583 alignleft" title="jonah_logo_main_e_large" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jonah_logo_main_e_large.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="274" /></a>Conversion therapy is not counseling for people who convert to Judaism. Rather, conversion therapy is an controversial program that is designed to help gay people become un-gay. It is most popular among religious groups who feel that being gay is prohibited by the Bible and they desperately want to rid themselves of their homosexuality.</p>
<p>The problem is that these techniques are shunned by all mainstream mental health groups.</p>
<p>Recently a lawsuit was filed against JONAH for engaging in these unregulated therapy sessions and causing more harm than good. The details are a bit sordid and not really necessary to understand what is happening. The suit alleges that JONAH is using controversial therapy methods to change people&#8217;s orientation and are causing serious pain to many of the people whom they are trying to help.</p>
<p>California courts are grappling with this as well.<span id="more-6580"></span> On one hand, a judge has ruled that the therapy should not be used and issued an injunction against its implementation. On the other hand, a federal judge ruled that therapy is mostly &#8220;speech&#8221; and the government cannot regulate &#8220;speech&#8221; without contravening the First Amendment. Meanwhile, activists believe that the therapy is effective and feel that it is unfairly maligned. We will see how this plays out over the next year or so.</p>
<p>As it relates to orthodox Jews, Conversion Therapy has become a passionate point of debate recently as well.</p>
<p>In Hakirah, Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky was quoted as a proponent of JONAH, basically endorsing the therapy that they do. This was met with a serious rebuttal in the subsequent (current) issue of Hakirah. The RCA endorsed JONAH for a while, but citing current scientific evidence, the RCA no longer endorses JONAH.</p>
<p>Then there is the lawsuit mentioned above. The suit is being brought to put a stop to JONAH&#8217;s practices. Meanwhile, JONAH is operating with rabbinic endorsements. Losing the suit could present a problem for rabbis wishing to endorse JONAH.</p>
<p>In the current issue of Dialogue* (I asterisk it because it is more like a monologue than a dialogue) Rabbi Ahron Feldman writes a passionate article about homosexuality and the frum community. In some places it is mildly progressive, in other places it is not and I believe it to be severely flawed. Perhaps I will formulate a respectful response to the entire article some day. For now, Rabbi Feldman endorses JONAH wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>This sets up a classic point of divergence between the charedi and modern orthodox community. The charedi community still supports JONAH and the working assumption is that the current whims of science are inconclusive or flat out wrong. Whereas the modern orthodox community takes the science that has emerged very seriously and changed their recommendation of conversion therapy based upon that scientific evidence.</p>
<p>I honestly think that it is as simple as that. As for me, unless there is a doctrine of faith that is contravened by science (and I know of none) I see no reason to reject science simply in favor of traditional thinking.</p>
<p>The question becomes, what would influence the charedi rabbis to change their stance? Anything? Is that right or wrong?</p>
<p>While frum men who are only attracted to men (and frum women to women) are left to wonder if they have a place in orthodox Judaism at all. And if they do, where and how. And while it may be interesting to talk about how to help orthodox men who don&#8217;t want to be attracted to men, the more important issue remains how important it is that we create safe places for all people to practice and observe their religion, even if they are gay and orthodox Jews.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/562.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6551" title="562" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/562-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" /></a>Yoram Hazony wrote a very interesting article for the NY Times Opinionator Blog. I am big fan of Yoram Hazony and I really like his original thinking.</p>
<p>In his article he attempts to address the perfection of God.</p>
<p>The familiar view to orthodox Jews today is that God is All-Knowing, All-Powerful, and All-Good. Hazony makes two primary arguments against this view. One is that it&#8217;s fairly evident Jewish thought on this has evolved. The God the Bible seems to be more limited than the God we talk about today (and have talked about for at least 2000 years). Second, there are philosophical problems with calling God &#8220;All-Everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>The great rabbis of post-Biblical Judaism have done an incredible job of interpreting the passages in the Bible that seem to limit God. Yet, even some of the medieval commentators were comfortable with an anthropomorphic God. This idea has completely fallen out of favor and is now considered heresy almost unanimously.</p>
<p>But we are less adept at dealing with the philosophical concerns of an &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God. Here there are newer issues that arise out of a better understanding of the world. Perfect is now understood in terms of balances. It is not understood as unlimited quantities of stuff. Further, to assert perfection requires us to have a complete vision of God. We don&#8217;t. God obscures Himself and even God&#8217;s favorite prophet Moses only caught a glimpse of God from the rear.</p>
<p>So Hazony proposes that we resurrect the idea of an imperfect God.<span id="more-6550"></span> The idea is that we hope that God will deal with us faithfully and there is justice. This creates a more true relationship with a more realistic God.</p>
<p>But the reason this idea has fallen out of favor, Hazony proposes, is because philosophers and religious leaders recognize that it is much more powerful to believe in the &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God than the imperfect God. Hazony concludes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Instead, they have preferred to speak to us of a God consisting of a series of sweeping idealizations — idealizations whose relation to the world in which we actually live is scarcely imaginable. Today, with theism rapidly losing ground across Europe and among Americans as well, we could stand to reconsider this point. Surely a more plausible conception of God couldn’t hurt.</em></p>
<p>This is the core issue of contemporary orthodox Judaism. Is plausibility and minimalism a better weapon against atheism or is mysticism and maximalism a better tool? The ultra-orthodox camp firmly believes that the key is insularity and an expansion of required beliefs. It asks that their adherents shield themselves from the outside world and empirical evidence. The more progressive orthodox groups embrace the challenges of modernity by looking for less familiar views on God and Judaism that are more compatible with modern thinking. It asks their adherents to work through any potential conflict and accept scientific inquiry and some of its conclusions.</p>
<p>The question raised by Hazony is which track is more likely to produce the desired result of devout believers. It&#8217;s a good question. It&#8217;s a different question that what is most comfortable, or what is easier, or what is more intellectually honest. He is simply asking which track has a better chance of survival.</p>
<p>I think he is correct that eventually it will be nearly impossible to ignore the outside world and the conflicts between it and the more maximalist positions. Granted, there will be contradictions to the minimalist positions as well, but it is easier to swallow a small pill than to swallow a beach ball.</p>
<p>Read Hazony&#8217;s article and join the conversation.</p>

For the uninitiated, fantasy sports are homegrown leagues of people who pick players in various sports and tally up the statistical achievements of those players. &#8220;Games&#8221; are played by pitting one person&#8217;s team against the other. The teams with more &#8220;points&#8221; is the winner. It&#8217;s even more lame than it sounds.</p>
<p>To me, sports is about real franchises winning and losing. It&#8217;s about teams and teamwork. Sports are about athletic ability, skill, and strategy. Sports are not about compiling numbers, counting numbers, and imaginary teams.</p>
<p>I have been an anti-fantasy sports evangelist for years. I have always been looking for someone to blame for the popularity of these imaginary contests.<span id="more-6428"></span></p>
<p>It turns out, the inventor of the entire genre is a Jewish man named Daniel Okrent. Aside from inventing fantasy sports, Okrent was the first public editor of the New York Times. A true nerd (and I mean that in the most endearing way possible), Okrent invented Fantasy Baseball and named it Rotisserie Baseball. The name has nothing to do with anything. It was just the name of a restaurant that Okrent pitched the idea to his friends.</p>
<p>So, once again, blame the Jew.</p>
<p>There is one small comfort is all this. In more than 30 years of Fantasy Baseball, Okrent has never won. Serves him right.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6371" title="images" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/images.jpeg" alt="" width="270" height="187" /></a>If you&#8217;ve ever been to a Bar Mitzvah party you know that the event has two separate components. There are adults congratulating the parents on their son&#8217;s wonderful performance and on the spectacular food. These people are generally well behaved.</p>
<p>Then there are the kids.</p>
<p>Oy vey, the kids.</p>
<p>At my bar mitzvah, the kids threw soda bottles agains the wall outside the hall in the hope that they would explode. Mind you, my father was the dean of the school, so this would be the most well behaved of the bar mitzvahs parties. When we were well behaved, in brief bouts, we were still mischievously pouring salt and pickle juice into our classmates&#8217; cups filled with soda in the hope that they would gag or spit out their drinks. Ahhh, memories.<span id="more-6370"></span></p>
<p>Anyway, it seems that the adults were on to us the entire time. Now they are getting serious and want to put a stop to the shenanigans. The NY Times is reporting that across the spectrum of Modern Orthodox to Reform Judaism schools and parents are teaching manners and etiquette so that the kids will act like <em>mentschen.</em> This is a great idea.The more right wing kids need to work on this as well. The only problem is that it assumes that the kids don&#8217;t behave at the bar mitzvahs because of a lack of information. The real reason kids misbehave at bar mitzvahs is because of a lack of caring.</p>
<p>But the programs have spurned a new debate. Who is responsible to make sure kids behave and learn good manners? Is the parents? The schools? Both?</p>
<p>This is a huge topic and I think it applies to the right wing orthodox Jewish institutions as well. How much of a child&#8217;s education falls on the parents and how much falls on the schools? When children are not successful, is it fair for parents to blame schools? Is it fair for schools to blame the parents?</p>
<p>Obviously, the answer is highly case specific and on a continuum. However, the question is a valid one.</p>
<p>In my opinion schools should focus most of their attention to education. A child who is learning well and succeeding in school is far less likely to act out. Students who are floundering are the usual suspects when it comes to misbehavior. In my experience these two things are related. If schools are doing a good job providing an education to their students there will be far fewer students with behavior issues.</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions. But as a general rule, I think behavior follows academic satisfaction.</p>
<p>Similarly, in my limited experience, parents who are involved in their child&#8217;s education and take an active role in parenting, have fewer behavior problems with their children. So if parents want well behaved children, the key is not to &#8220;teach behavior&#8221;. The key is to be a good parent.</p>
<p>Then again, bar mitzvah kids are 13. Let&#8217;s not get carried away with our expectations of their behavior either&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what I think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pic12t.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6297" title="pic12t" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pic12t-300x221.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="221" /></a>The NY Times has an article on what they call a new trend among the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors. As most people are aware, the Nazis branded the prisoners of Auschwitz and Birkenau with tattoos. Each Jew had a specific number and their number was branded onto their skin.</p>
<p>The tattoos have become a symbol of the Holocaust and the particularly degrading manner by which the Nazis catalogued their Jewish prisoners.</p>
<p>For most survivors that I know, the tattoos represented an odd mixture of shame, anger, and pride. As the number of survivors still alive dwindles, the symbolism of the tattooed numbers have taken on a new life. Some of the grandchildren of the survivors are having their grandparents&#8217; numbers tattooed onto their own bodies. This tribute is a touching way to recall the pain and pride of the survivors and pass that on to the next generation.</p>
<p>The people in the NY Times article seem to appreciate that gesture. The photos attached to the article online are haunting and very moving.</p>
<p>The NY Times also notes the irony of the tattoos.</p>
<p><span id="more-6296"></span></p>
<p>Tattoos are forbidden by Jewish Law. Obviously, the tattoos from the concentration camps are exempt from this prohibition. But voluntary tattoos are prohibited by the Torah.</p>
<p>While I appreciate the subtle beauty of the Holocaust tribute tattoos, I cannot help but wish that there was another way to honor our survivors. Breaking a very well known Jewish law to &#8220;stick it&#8221; to the Nazis and honor one&#8217;s grandparents can&#8217;t be the best way to accomplish those goals.</p>
<p>Of course I know that these grandchildren are not observant of halachic Judaism, obviously, but I still think there is room for respecting the traditions of one&#8217;s ancestors while honoring one&#8217;s ancestors.</p>
<p>The article is fascinating and I recommend reading it. Let me know your reaction to this tribute.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/8178.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6228" title="8178" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/8178.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="202" /></a>I won&#8217;t ruin it for you, but Avital Chizhik has hit another home run in her latest article. This time she has been published by the NY Times in their Opinionator Blog.</p>
<p>The article teaches an important lesson in tolerance. We tend to focus on our differences. I know I am certainly guilty of this. Everyone is guilty of it. The best tool in our arsenal of building tolerance and creating bridges is to focus on our similarities. When we see other people who look so different or who affiliate themselves so differently, we tend to zone in on those stark differences.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t it true that we are much more alike than we are different?<span id="more-6227"></span></p>
<p>With fellow Jews, we share much more than we realize sometimes. Often the people we like least are the people that are closest to us ideologically. But that is not a reason to hate someone else. That should be a ton of reasons to like someone else.</p>
<p>With members of other faiths we also share so much. Sure we disagree on some things, but overall we agree on a lot. This is the key to interfaith relations.</p>
<p>With secular people we share so much. Sure we disagree on a few big name items, but we agree on many things. If we can focus on the things upon which we agree, a lot of the anger and disdain will fall away. There is absolutely no reason that religious and secular people cannot work together on projects and ideas that are compatible with our mutually held beliefs.</p>
<p>The 20th century and the early 21st century brought strong feelings of nationalism. As the world shrunk, people needed to self identify more strongly with their ethnicity or religion. People were introduced to new cultures and ways of life that they never new existing. It created existential angst. In response, people retreated to their more tribal instincts as they needed a way to set themselves apart. The world suffered through several wars as a result of this nationalism and exclusionary philosophy.</p>
<p>Yet, the world continued to shrink and people continue to create imaginary lines between themselves and others as a defense mechanism to the world shrinking. It doesn&#8217;t make us stronger as individuals. It does not make our communities or religious groups stronger. It does not make society stronger.</p>
<p>Weakening our ties to each other weakens the human race in every possible way. The first step to making things right is recognizing what is highlighted in this article.</p>
<p>Go read it. Then take its lesson to heart.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/02STONE-tmagArticle.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6224" title="02STONE-tmagArticle" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/02STONE-tmagArticle-300x151.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="151" /></a>In the NY Times, Carlos Fraenkel  writes about his initiative to increase cross-communication between believers and non-believers as well as between different groups of believers. Fraenkel is a philosopher and the various philosophies of different groups intrigues him. The basic premise of his efforts is that most people are religious or secular based on things that are completely out of their control. Where one is born, to whom one is born, when one is born, are the most relevant factors in determining beliefs.</p>
<p>Fraenkel paraphrases the great Muslim philosopher who questioned his beliefs when he realized he would have been a fervent Jew or Christian had he been born to a Jewish or Christian family.</p>
<p>I will never forget when <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/09/rabbi-yosef-tendler-of-blessed-memory/" target="_blank">Rabbi Tendler</a> told me that he had the same question. It&#8217;s a bit of an epiphany when one realizes that this is likely the truth. But this question is not the focus of Fraenkel&#8217;s article or this blog post.<span id="more-6223"></span></p>
<p>Fraenkel proposes that we create a culture of debate. People from all backgrounds would discuss their ideas and hopefully arrive at some level of truth. He disingenuously invokes the debates of the middle ages as support. I say disingenuously, because those debates often had fatal consequences for the loser. Be that as it may, Fraenkel&#8217;s proposal is to teach debate and philosophy as a way of increasing mutual tolerance between believers of different faiths and non-believers.</p>
<p>I think he is sincere and I agree with his theory about tolerance. Although, I must forewarn that I am pretty sure that without incredible sensitivity, these debates will result in less tolerance and less adherence to one&#8217;s faith. It is very difficult to have religious debate without it turning personal or offensive. Further, most people are not well versed enough in their religions to carry an honest debate. If he think he can pull it off, more power to him. But I think increased debate will undoubtably lead to less fervent belief. The group with superior debaters will surely influence the others. Meaning, the personality and skill of the debater can outshine the substance of the arguments.</p>
<p>But Fraenkel&#8217;s overall point is very worthy. His idea is to slow the melting pot and create a multi-cultural society where people have strong religious or ethnic identities but live together in harmony. This is a very noble idea and I share this dream. The problem is that when people live in less homogenous environments their strong beliefs are bound to be weakened. Insularity is harmful for many things, but it is helpful for reinforcing beliefs. So while I dream of the same kind of society as Fraenkel, I am skeptical that this dream can become a reality.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend the NY Times article.</p>
<p>On Jewish Ideas Daily, Fraenkel writes a follow up to his NY Times article where he discusses his work with some chasidic Jews. I think only one or two of them are Satmar and the others are Chabad. As you should know by now, Chabad is different than the other Chasidic groups in many ways (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/29/book-review-unchosen/">Book Review | Unchosen</a>) and I think that the differences play a role in their involvement here. But we are going to pretend that all chasidic groups are the same for the sake of this post.</p>
<p>The article is long and sometimes boring, but worth reading in its entirety. The basic idea is that some chasids have a philosophy study group with Fraenkel and this has contributed to their disenfranchisement with their community. This is a really cool idea and I think it is great to learn philosophy, especially with an expert like Fraenkel. The article is also full of excellent observations on insular chasidic life. Many of the observations are equally valid in non-chasidic orthodox environments as well. (Those were my favorite parts of the article).</p>
<p>The problem that I have with this little study group is that they reinforce the stereotype that orthodox Judaism is not up to the challenge of philosophy. The article implies in more than one place that these fellows are the new enlightened orthodox Jews and they now know that orthodox Judaism is incompatible with modern thinking.</p>
<p>However, this is not true. The reason this group feels that way is because they were disenfranchised before they began studying philosophy. They had already left orthodox Judaism in their hearts and minds before they began to study with Fraenkel. I would hardly expect them to survive an in depth analysis of philosophy once their collective bubbles had been burst.</p>
<p>I wish Fraenkel would find a study group of committed orthodox Jews. That would be more interesting to me and more useful overall. As it is now, he is dealing with people who want to leave but are stuck. Not exactly a case study in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Learning philosophy and engaging in debate in the more formative years of yeshiva learning could be very beneficial. It was considered beneficial to the medieval Jewish commentators. We could learn a think or two from them. But in the end, philosophy in Judaism is periphery. It is not the reasons we do anything and it is mostly conjecture as God has not handed us a book of philosophy. But working things out in one&#8217;s mind and challenging each other to understand the questions and answers of our religion is a good thing. It was good 1000 years ago. It should be good now as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close with an invitation to Professor Fraenkel: Come to LA and study with some committed orthodox Jews who are part of less insular communities. I think the results would be extremely fascinating.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6189" title="Capture" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>By now you&#8217;ve heard that the American Academy of Pediatrics has published their recent findings on circumcision. Until now, the medical benefits of circumcision were questioned and science did not have an &#8220;opinion&#8221; on the matter. Now, the AAP has found that there are some benefits to circumcision.</p>
<p>Of course, this is being touted as a major victory for Jews and Muslims who circumcise their children and a spear in the eye of the Intactivists here in American and abroad on Europe. I have seen articles on Commentary and Cross-Currents to that effect.</p>
<p>I think there are three slightly sobering points that are important to make in light of this discovery and the cheers from circumcision advocates drunk with joy over this report.</p>
<p><span id="more-6188"></span></p>
<p>First, we don&#8217;t circumcise because of the medical benefits of circumcision. I daresay that even if circumcision were deemed medically harmful we would still circumcise. More importantly, there is no tenet of our belief that requires circumcision be medically beneficial. We believe it is spiritually beneficial. No science can prove or disprove that.</p>
<p>Second, the study simply does not state that they are many benefits to circumcision or that the benefits affect many people. In fact, the benefit described is that circumcised men are less likely to contract AIDS in third world countries. Orthodox Judaism already has a great way of preventing AIDS, it&#8217;s called fidelity. That is aside from the fact that we are living in modern countries and not third world countries. This &#8220;benefit&#8221; hardly benefits the religious community. I mean, are we seriously going to start teaching our kids that Bris Milah is a great way of preventing AIDS? Further, the medical data is subject to change. We can&#8217;t rely on science to save circumcision.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: When is this medical benefit realized? When one becomes sexually active and the partner has HIV. Is this really something we are concerned with? Further, the objection of the Intactivist is not that circumcision should be banned. It is that children should not be circumcised when they are babies. If one wishes to have the procedure done to minimally guard against AIDS then have the procedure done before becoming sexually active. There is no compelling reason to do it when the child is a baby. The medical benefit does not bolster the argument that we should circumcise at birth. Not at all.</p>
<p>Finally, the argument against circumcision that is being made by Intactivists is unaffected by this study. The reason they oppose circumcision is not because it is inherently harmful, rather it is because the choice is not being made by the person affected by the decision. Would we condone a parent tattooing their child? Obviously not. This is despite the fact that tattoos are not harmful to the child. Intactivists oppose circumcision for the same reason. A child should have the right to decide if they want to be circumcised. It is not the parents&#8217; decision to make. The point is that it makes no difference whether there is a medical benefit, as specious or as generous as the benefit might be, the objection to circumcision is that the parent is making a decision for the child that the child should make on their own.</p>
<p>Creating strawman Intactivists and knocking them down may be great fun and make us feel good about ourselves. But in the end, we need to understand the challenge of the Intactivists and make good, solid arguments in defense of circumcision.</p>
<p>I have argued that the aforementioned objection does not apply to orthodox Jews or Muslims in a previous post. I maintain that this is the best argument against Intactivists and relying on new scientific data is not our best argument. Read that post here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/22/circumcision-follow-up-or-why-circumcision-is-not-barbaric-for-orthodox-jews/">Circumcision Follow Up (or why circumcision is not barbaric for Orthodox Jews)</a>. Read it again. It&#8217;s still as relevant as it was then.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/augusta82012.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6160" title="augusta82012" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/augusta82012-230x300.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="300" /></a>Augusta National Golf Club is famous for two things. It has been the home of the Masters Tournament for about 8o years and it has been a club that excluded women from membership. Women were permitted to play the course but were denied membership.</p>
<p>Pressure to enter women into membership has been ongoing for about 10 years. The club finally relented this week and has admitted two women as members. The two women are Condoleeza Rice and Darla Moore.</p>
<p>This is a major breakthrough. The club is a private club and private institutions have much more leeway in restricting membership than public institutions. Public institutions are subject to the will of the government and legislation. That means that the laws could be &#8220;ahead&#8221; of the public. Sometimes the government establishes a standard that is fair or just but not necessarily the will of the public. However, when a private club changes its policies it is a much more profound statement about the will of the people. A private institution is much more likely to wait until the public demand fairness or justice before it acts. Private institutions rarely establish standards that are &#8220;ahead&#8221; of their time. They are much more likely to establish standards that reflect the public&#8217;s consciousness.<span id="more-6159"></span></p>
<p>Augusta is finally doing what the government did many decades ago. They are treating women just like men with respect to admittance into their private club.</p>
<p>There are two ways to look at this. One is to say that the &#8220;free market&#8221; got it right. A private institution not subject to government regulation figured out that the marketplace wants a club that admits men and women.</p>
<p>The other way to look at this is to say, yes, the free market got it right, but it took way too long! If you wait around for the free market an injustice can perpetuate for years or even decades until the marketplace demands it. The marketplace does not <em>set</em> morality. It merely reflects public opinion. It was wrong for a club to discriminate &#8211; even if the market does not demand it. Waiting for the free market to figure out what is right and what is wrong is not an efficient way of establishing social change. It might get the job done eventually, but sometimes society needs a kick in the pants from authority.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t think that barring women from membership is wrong, just look at Augusta&#8217;s previous policy of not allowing blacks as members until 1990. It took until 1990 for the free market to demand equality based on skin color. <em>1990</em>!</p>
<p>The point is that while the free market might be a great way of running an economic system, I have no comment on that issue at this time, it is a poor way of determining fairness and justice. Case in point: Augusta National.</p>
<p>In closing, Augusta National is a real place and this is a real story. But if it weren&#8217;t, this entire post could be a metaphor for orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Spy_Vs__Spy_by_SkippyWoodFood.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6121" title="Spy_Vs__Spy_by_SkippyWoodFood" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Spy_Vs__Spy_by_SkippyWoodFood-300x182.png" alt="" width="300" height="182" /></a>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that effectively allows the government to wiretap anyone they choose without fear of repercussion. In its ruling, the court stated that while a warrant-less wiretap was not valid, the victims of the wiretap could not sue for damages because of sovereign immunity (protection from suit for the government). This reversed a ruling in the District Court that awarded damages to two victims of an illegal wiretap.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the case were suspected of involvement with Al Qaeda. The government surveilled them without obtaining a warrant. They found out about it in the NY Times and sued. As it stands now, the government cannot be sued for this breach of Constitutional law.<span id="more-6119"></span></p>
<p>It seems that the primary issue in this case on appeal was whether the language of the statute that prohibits unlawful surveillance constituted an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity. In its ruling, the Court of Appeals held that it did not. As support for their ruling, the court added that the legislature rejected a section in the law that would have waived sovereign immunity thus proving that it was left out intentionally.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs could sue for damages if the information is used. However they cannot sue for damages simply because the information was collected.</p>
<p>So we are left with a law with very few teeth. While the government is not permitted to spy on us, the government will suffer no harm for doing so unless it uses the unlawfully obtained information. This is easy to avoid, because once the wiretap provides enough information, the government can discover new information lawfully and rely on that new information for prosecutorial purposes.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs were spied upon under a Bush administration spy program. It seems we are now stuck with this law and its arcane ramifications.</p>
<p>It should not concern us that the victims of this illegal wiretap were Al Qaeda suspects. They were American citizens just like the rest of us. Any one of us can be a victim of similar illegal government action.</p>
<p>If Congress feels that the law yields a bad result they can amend the legislation to waive sovereign immunity. As citizens, we can petition our representatives in D.C. to do that. They don&#8217;t have to listen, but it looks like that is our best shot at protected ourselves from being spied upon by the government.</p>
<p>It is not the court&#8217;s job to fix the law. That is the job of the legislature. Let&#8217;s hope they fix it soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TALMUD-popup.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6104" title="TALMUD-popup" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TALMUD-popup-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>I like the NY Times. The quality of content and the breadth of its coverage is outstanding. I am a subscriber and I enjoy reading as much as I can read of the Times in print and online. I feel comfortable with the Times in my home because they avoid the salacious tabloid stories you find in the other papers and report the important and interesting stories. (We get the Wall Street Journal as well for many of the same reasons.)</p>
<p>It is rare to see them blow the coverage as badly as they have done with their story on the Siyum HaShas.</p>
<p>A story in the Metro Section spend approximately 10 words talking about the Siyum and about 1000 words talking about women in orthodox Judaism. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, women in orthodox Judaism is an important story. We talk it about it all the time around here. But it was not the story of the Siyum.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing one would expect from a tabloid. Talk about the small detail that gets people riled up to sell papers. But the NY Times is better than that.<br />
<span id="more-6102"></span></p>
<p>The Siyum was the biggest event in recent memory in New York. Almost 100,000 people in one place at one time. It&#8217;s not as if the Siyum could be written off as a blip on the radar. It was a major event. Traffic was the worst it has been in 25 years according to some traffic experts due in part to the Siyum. The traffic reports on the radio were talking about the event in greater detail and with greater reverence than the NY Times article. During traffic reports the story is the traffic, yet they still managed to slip in some information about the event. The NY Times story was about the Siyum and they nearly forgot to talk about the Siyum. There was plenty to report. The Times could have talked about the rabbis at the Siyum who came from Israel. They could have talked about the concept behind Daf Yomi. They could have talked about the actual event. But they did not.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t attribute this <em>faux pas</em> to anti-Semitism or disdain for traditional orthodox Judaism. I chalk it up to dismal reporting. That is what it was and for the NY Times to miss the point on such a huge event is rare and also disappointing.</p>
<p>As for the mechitza and the implications thereof. First of all, the mechitza was up for about 35 minutes of a 6 hour program. It was so insignificant in the grand scheme of things that to be talking about the mechitza is to completely miss the point. The women were not being &#8220;hidden&#8221;. Frum Jews simply pray with a mechitza at almost all times. That&#8217;s what they did here. The organizers of the event wanted people not to have to think about compromising in their standards of separated prayer. Still, people want to talk about it. So here you go.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone really thinks the mechitza was absolutely necessary. It was impossible for one to see across the stadium. The women were so far away from the men that I can&#8217;t imagine anyone would have a halachic problem davening without the mechitza. In the small area where men and women sat near one another I think a mechitza between the men and women would have been appropriate. The all encompassing mechitza was a bit more than necessary. But Frum Jews don&#8217;t like to pray without a mechitza and it is understandable that they would plan to use a mechitza during davening times. This is all normal behavior.</p>
<p>It did look a bit strange to the insider and to the outsider. But again, this is what most orthodox Jews expect at an event that has two minyanim. The fact that there was no mechitza for 5 and a half hours simply outweighs the fact that there was a mechitza for 35 minutes. I am not saying that this was &#8220;progress&#8221;. I am saying that this is normal in orthodox Judaism so you can&#8217;t make a big deal about something that is normal in orthodox Judaism simply because it took place in MetLife stadium.</p>
<p>Personally, I found the constant reminders at the Siyum about &#8220;kavod HaToyrah&#8221; and the extend they separated men and women a bit over the top. Nothing is going to happen if men and women walk into the stadium together.  To prove my point, there were no separate exits and men and women left the Siyum together, were walking together in the parking lot, and as far as I know, there were no incidents of offensive immoral behavior due to the commingling of men and women. Would the kedusha of the event have been compromised if we all used one entrance? Probably not. So I don&#8217;t love the idea of over-separated men and women. But I expect it, and it is not the story of the Siyum. Not one bit.</p>
<p>And for next time, if you want to sit with your wife, your daughter, your sister, or the other women in your life, pony up for a suite. Those are unregulated seating sections. Start saving your pennies now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/3454935091_Explaination_xlarge.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5750" title="3454935091_Explaination_xlarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/3454935091_Explaination_xlarge-300x236.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a>Children are fascinating creatures. All adults started out as children, yet we seem to have no real recollection of what it was like to be a child. Can we really recall what it was like to try things for the first time? Do we remember what it was like to dream of being old enough to make our own decisions? Or to be excluded from conversations because we were not old enough?</p>
<p>I think that intellectually we have those memories in our collective psyche but we can&#8217;t really relate to children.</p>
<p>One of the more difficult roles that adults need to play in the lives of children is &#8220;Answerer of Questions&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are many types of questions and many approaches to answering their questions. Some questions relate to religion, others to society, others are just questions that we cannot answer because we simply don&#8217;t know the answer.</p>
<p>An article in this week&#8217;s NY Times Magazine addresses the concerns of one father as he and his son encounter stereotypes in books and movies. In just 60 years, we as a society have severely adjusted what we consider proper and appropriate depictions of minorities. Yet, some stereotypes persist and are still debated in 2012.<span id="more-5749"></span></p>
<p>The article begins with the child asking why some pirates have a gorilla. The &#8220;gorilla&#8221; is not a gorilla. It is just a very ugly stereotype of an African male.</p>
<p>What do you answer your children when they ask about these ugly stereotypes? Read the article to see what that guy does.</p>
<p>But the article got me thinking about a few things as they relate to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>For starters, I think it is good for us to know that all kids have questions and many parents are placed in the uncomfortable position of answering them. It&#8217;s not just us.</p>
<p>Next, the obvious correlation to orthodox Judaism. In general, we teach our children a very midrashic form of Judaism. We also neglect to mention that there are other interpretations that are valid even within orthodox Judaism. So when our children ask questions and they challenge the wisdom they are being taught, we have ourselves a similar quandary. There are several options. We can defer until they get older. We can change the subject. We can answer the way we would answer an adult. We can reinforce the more fundamentalist view. We have to make the best choice for ourselves and our family.</p>
<p>But the most difficult issues arise when modern sensibilities feel betrayed by commandments in the Torah. I don&#8217;t need to be specific. But there are many instances where a child&#8217;s innocence can cause them to question the Divine Wisdom of God. What are we to say then? How do we explain to our children that God&#8217;s Book has different ideas about what is fair and just than we do?</p>
<p>There are really only three options. 1) We are wrong. God is right. Our minds are perverted by society and when our mind conflicts with God&#8217;s word, we must be wrong. Adjust your thinking accordingly. 2)We are right. God is wrong. Our society is smarter than the Author of this book that claims to be Divine. Toss the Book. 3) The word of God was just at one time. Society has changed and God&#8217;s will can change based on society&#8217;s adjustments.</p>
<p>Option 1 is easy. Fundamentalist Jews use this all the time and with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Option 2 is also easy. It not an acceptable approach in orthodox Judaism. Not one tiny bit.</p>
<p>Option 3 is complicated. Certainly, this is one part of the overall approach of the Reform and Conservative movements. This is not a sufficient reason for it to be wrong in the eyes of orthodox Jews, but it is a warning sign to many. The real question is not who subscribes to this belief, rather, is this belief an acceptable belief in certain circumstances?</p>
<p>Now I am not enough of an expert, by any means, to completely answer this question. However, I do have some preliminary thoughts. First of all, isn&#8217;t this the message of Avraham&#8217;s prayer for the Sedomites? I think it may be.</p>
<p>Further, some parts of Biblical Judaism have already been abrogated, either by the fact that we don&#8217;t have a Temple, or a Sanhedrin, or a Biblical Court. Other parts have been abrogated by the fact that we are not in a position to carry out the word of God. So what do we make of these? Are we to say that God&#8217;s will is that we should really be following these laws but we are <em>anusim</em> in these matters? Or do we say that this is fate? God&#8217;s will is that we should adapt over time and these laws should not be followed in 2012.</p>
<p>There are also cultural and social aspects of contemporary orthodox Judaism that may seem to be part of Judaism but are really just non-essential parts of our lives. Certainly, there are some things that fall into this category that may even be a mitzvah to reject. I will leave this category as a very general comment.</p>
<p>And then there are areas of Jewish law and thought that have not been touched or adjusted at all over time. Or have only been marginally adjusted. Admittedly, I don&#8217;t think any of those are explicitly found in the written Torah. But the Oral Law has generally been treated with the same reverence and reluctance for change. So returning to the original question, is Option 3 acceptable for orthodox Jews?</p>
<p>In some ways yes in other ways no. Is there a pattern or any rhyme or reason to when the answer is yes and when the answer is no? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Most importantly, these questions are not just questions that our children ask, they are questions that we as adults ask. We can&#8217;t be afraid of the questions. We need to be confident in our answers or in our lack of answers. But either way, taking Option 1 or Option 2 ends the conversation. We don&#8217;t want to end the conversation. We want to continue the conversation that&#8217;s been taking place for 3000 years and will take place until the end of days.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was alerted to a very interesting article in the NY Times that provided some really good food for thought. The article sets its launching point at an ornithological discovery in 2005. A thought to extinct bird was spotted and the evidence was uploaded to the Internet.</p>
<p>It seems that although there was enough evidence for the journal Science, thousands of bird enthusiasts dissected the evidence and have conclusively shown the discovery to have been a hoax (or mistake).</p>
<p>This kind of thing happens all the time. And it&#8217;s been happening for a long time.</p>
<p>Going back to the earliest days of writing, readers would comment, redact, correct, disagree, argue, and question what they were reading by writing notes in the margins or writing glosses or writing something to counter what they had just read. Later, readers of both the original and the subsequent writings would sometimes collect them and publish them together. Sometimes they would fix the errors, other times they would just add the notes of others.</p>
<p>In fact, this is precisely how the Mishna and Talmud were composed.<span id="more-5635"></span> The Mishna is made up of short snippets of Jewish law that were culled from the notes of prior scholars. The compiler, Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi, combined earlier opinions with later opinions and used his judgment to produce the best result for the future of Judaism. The Talmud then records hundreds of years of conversations and annotations on the Mishna. Ravina and Rav Ashi made the final choices about which comments, arguments, proofs, anecdotes, discussions, and clarifications to include.</p>
<p>To a lesser degree the same thing happened with the Midrash, as the author of the NY Times article notes. Throughout Jewish history, scholars have been using this method to develop Jewish law and thought. This is the way many of the Rishonim and Achronim made their way into our daily lives. Rashi on Chumash is a great example of this. He took his favorite interpretations that he found in prior works and now they are found as part of his commentary in almost every Chumash printed. The many commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch follow the same pattern. They had notes in the margins of their copies of the Shulchan Aruch and later printers wished to include them in their new versions of the Shulchan Aruch and now the Shach and Taz are household names.</p>
<p>The NY Times article argues that the Internet creates the same kind of writer to commenter interface. The writer says something. The reader has something to say in return and the result is sometimes beautiful discussion, and other times flamewar. Either way, much of the value in today&#8217;s writing is not found in the original article, it is found in the comments section. Or in the Facebook comments, or the Tweets, or the Reddit threads. Wherever it is found, the readers&#8217; contributions often have a lot of value.</p>
<p>Some bloggers, like <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a>, consistently tout the excellence of the comments on their blog. I tend to agree. DovBear has had some amazing commenters. The posts on this blog don&#8217;t usually generate as robust conversations as the posts on his blog, but when there are good conversations here, the comments become the stars of the show and the posts become basic material for discussion. <em>(Parenthetically, DovBear&#8217;s blog comments from over 7000 posts are on the verge of being lost forever. A tragedy if I ever heard one&#8230;)</em></p>
<p>In the tradition of the redactors and later publishers of the great works of history that integrated the original writings with subsequent comments, the author of the NY Times article suggests that the Internet needs a redactor. The best comments and opinions that follow the original articles need to highlighted somehow, even integrated into the posts. The give and take of the comment thread produces excellent material and oftentimes helps the group come to a better truth. It would be such a shame if all that wisdom was lost in the black hole of cyberspace.</p>
<p>But the real powerful point of the article is that experts and non-experts have an equal voice in the comments. And the crowd has a unique ability to ferret out lies, fools, and fallacies. If we all take our commenting duties seriously, we can help the greater community arrive at truths that may have been otherwise missed, either intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p>When it comes to discourse on religion, clearly there are some ground rules upon which we all need to agree in order to facilitate positive discussion. But when the rules are agreed upon and the discussion is vociferous, yet civil, we can benefit from coming closer to a truth. That is just another of the incredibly powerful uses of the Internet for the orthodox Jew. If we ban it, we lose that opportunity. I don&#8217;t think that it is a stretch to say that the Internet might exist simply for us to make the most of that opportunity and make the future of orthodox Judaism as viable and vibrant as it must be for our children and grandchildren.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DoctorCartoon.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5542" title="DoctorCartoon" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DoctorCartoon-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>Yeshiva University Museum, (I had no idea that there was such a place,) is hosting an exhibit on Jewish doctors. You know the famous joke about the inauguration of the first Jewish president? His mother is in the front row sitting next to her old Jewish lady friends and as the president-elect gets up on the podium, she tells her friend, ya know, his brother is a Doctor!</p>
<p>Yes, there is a Jewish doctor stereotype, but this article on the NY Times about the exhibit gives us a clue as to how this happened. Judaism does not view medicine as heretical or an affront to religion. On the contrary, the doctor is considered the emissary of God and an ally in the healing process.</p>
<p>Judaism does not allow people to rely on God for Divine Intervention or a miracle in lieu of seeking professional medical help. There is no faith healing or reluctance to seek human intervention in Judaism. And so, a culture of favoring medicine over faith is intrinsic to the Jewish experience. In fact, one of the most influential and important Jewish scholars of all time was Maimonides. He was a physician as well as a scholar.<span id="more-5540"></span></p>
<p>My grandfather was a medical consultant by trade. He was the president of Laniado Hospital in Netanya, Israel. He was the person who built the hospital and brought the Klausenberg Rebbe&#8217;s dream into reality. He was very fond of quoting the Rebbe in this regard. When someone would come to the Rebbe for a blessing or advice, before anything else the Rebbe would ask &#8220;<em>Vos zugt der doctor</em>&#8221; &#8211; what does the doctor say.</p>
<p>This was to reinforce the message that health and sickness are very dependent on what the doctor says and what the doctor does.</p>
<p>Of course, the exhibition will also highlight some of the anti-Semitism that Jewish doctors have faced over the last few hundred years. At one point, Catholics were not permitted to seek medical help from a Jewish doctor. Sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>If you are in New York, you might find the exhibit interesting. I hope I will be able to see it some time over the summer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_5510" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5510" title="Orthodox-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: NY Times</p></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s New York Times features a below the fold, front page article on sex abuse in the Hasidic community of New York. It&#8217;s usually not a good thing when orthodox Jews are on the front page of a newspaper, even below the fold. I am aware that this article reflects poorly on Hasidic Jews in particular and orthodox Jews in general. But I have to say that I found the article to be pretty fair overall and an excellent assessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Contra the article in the Forward, this article does not focus on DA Hynes (although it seems there will be an article about him tomorrow), the article in the NY Times focuses on the victims and the social pressure not to report incidents of abuse.</p>
<p>This is the real problem. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</p>
<p>The article tells the story of several victims and their families who did report the abuse to authorities only to find that they were shunned, excommunicated, or bought off. </p>
<p><span id="more-5509"></span></p>
<p>According to the article it goes all the way to the top. A family member of the Vizhnitz Rebbe in Monsey is alleged to have offered $20,000 to a victim&#8217;s family to drop charges. This is not some low level handler. This is not some shnook with a printer posting signs. This is the Grand Rebbe&#8217;s family. If that is how the leadership of thousands of Hasidic Jews handles abuse, what are we to expect from his followers?</p>
<p>Justice Guston L. Reichbach is a hero for standing up to the support of the community behind the accused and the lack of support for the victim. In court, he expressed deep disappointment with the community&#8217;s response in support of the abuser. He said there was a<em> &#8220;communal attitude that seeks to blame, indeed punish, victims.”</em> He also rebuked the multitude of Hasidic Jews in the courtroom standing in support of the abuser for writing letters in support of the defendant without a single word of <em>&#8220;any concern or any sympathy or even any acknowledgment for these young victims, which, frankly, I find shameful.”</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It was nice to see the workaround for <em>mesira</em> suggested by one rabbi, to tell a psychologist about the abuse and the psychologist will report it. This is completely unnecessary of course. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira (The Jewish Informant) in Halacha</a></p>
<p>In addition to the text of the article, there are several very interesting documents attached. Take some time to read them. They are worth investigating.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that there is no greater incidence of abuse in the ultra-orthodox community. There is just a much lower rate of reporting.</p>
<p>But the most difficult and heartbreaking part of the entire article was the quote from Rabbi Zweibel of the Agudah.</p>
<p>First of all, the Agudah has nothing to do with this. Hasidic groups could not care less what the Agudah says about sex abuse. So his quote is a non-sequitor. But he was asked his opinion and he reaffirmed with what we already know. His organization believes that a victim should go to a rabbi before going to the police. To be fair, the Agudah <em>expects </em>rabbis to be reasonable and advise bona fide victims to go to the police. However, there is little evidence that this will happen. I should also add that this is a step forward, believe it or not. It used to be that one was prohibited to go to the police at all, now one can go if a rabbi advises it. Baby steps.</p>
<p>But the worst part about what he said was this brusque comment: <em>&#8220;You can destroy a person’s life with a false report&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Absorb that for a moment.</p>
<p>The concern is that a false report could ruin someone&#8217;s life. I have two things to say about this. Both are very important.</p>
<p>First, this is built on a fallacious assumption. That is, that only rabbis have the ability to sniff out a false report and further that law enforcement is incapable of doing this task on their own. Both of this are horribly wrong. Rabbis are not trained to discern between true allegations, innuendo, and pure fabrication. Law enforcement professionals are trained to do that. They do it with regularity and with much success. Charges are not brought unless law enforcement is convinced that the abuse happened AND that it could be proved in a court of law. To say that rabbis are needed to protect innocent people who are falsely accused overstates their abilities and understates the reality.</p>
<p>But much, much, much more important is the implication of this policy. Victims of abuse have their entire lives ruined. One cannot overstate the effect of sexual abuse on a person. It haunts them every day of their life. Contemplating suicide is a normal response for a victim of abuse. It can become impossible for victims to function normally. Indeed, many victims have taken their own lives, unable to cope. Sex abuse kills. There are great rabbis who have held that an abuser is a <em>rodef</em>, a pursuer who is trying to kill someone, and anything and everything that can be done to stop them <em>must </em>be done. Sex abuse <em>destroys people&#8217;s lives.</em></p>
<p>I have <em>never </em>heard of someone who was falsely accused of a crime who committed suicide, who could not have a relationship with his or her spouse, who could not love, who could not trust, who could not cope with life. Is it an inconvenience? Absolutely. I  would not wish a false accusation on anybody. But to protect falsely accused people (which are a <em>very</em> rare occurrence) because it could ruin their life, when juxtaposed with the destruction caused by sex abuse comes off as so far removed from reality that it is scary.</p>
<p>To recap: Rabbis are not super-qualified to ascertain the truth of an accusation, law enforcement is qualified. False accusations are rare. When they occur they can harm a person&#8217;s life. To spare the falsely accused at the expense of victims is a heinous travesty of misplaced priorities. It is sick.</p>
<p>I want to end on a more positive note. My rabbis have all said that if one is a victim of abuse they <em>must </em>go to the police. These are ultra-orthodox rabbis. My point is that some rabbis get it. They were not the rabbis interviewed in the NY Times, but they are out there. <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/07/14/yadeinu-shafchu-es-hadam-hazeh/" target="_blank">As Rabbi Adlerstein wrote</a>, <em>&#8220;If your rov (rabbi) doesn’t get it, think of getting a new rov.&#8221;</em></p>

The question was a challenge for people to explain <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/03/21/the-ny-times-ethicist-wants-to-know-why-you-eat-meat/">why they eat meat</a>. The Ethicist invited responses and suggestions promising that the best ones would be selected and presented to the people for a vote.</p>
<p>That day has come and the responses are predictably weak. Six essays were published online and readers can vote for their favorite.</p>
<p>None of the responses justify eating meat en masse or the farming of animals purely for the sake of slaughter.<span id="more-5420"></span> I hope some responses of that nature were either omitted by the Ethicist as opposed to none being submitted.</p>
<p>A response that is sure to be popular is that indeed it is not necessarily the right thing to do, but we are not perfect so why start with eating meat? That&#8217;s an honest approach but not a logical approach.</p>
<p>The weakest answer is to &#8220;why is it ethical to eat meat?&#8221; was the guy who said it isn&#8217;t so he doesn&#8217;t but he will when artificially produced meat is for sale. Talk about avoiding the question!</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t have much to add, I just felt it my duty to report that the Ethicist has selected some favorites and you can vote and comment on them.</p>
<p>Bon appétit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Torah-Scroll-text-silver-yad.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5399" title="Torah-text" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Torah-Scroll-text-silver-yad-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>A few weeks ago, Stanley Fish wrote a two part series in the NY Times about science, religion, belief, and evidence. Fish makes the argument that science has jumped the shark and is no different than religion at this point. His proof is from a statement made by Richard Dawkins. In my opinion, Fish is 100% wrong.</p>
<p>In an interview on MSNBC, Dawkins was explaining that science is not based on belief, rather it is based on facts and demonstrable evidence. To bolster his point he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230; in the arena of science you can invoke Professor So-and-So’s study published in 2008, you can actually cite <strong>chapter and verse</strong>.&#8221;<span id="more-5397"></span></em></p>
<p>Fish then goes on to say that since Dawkins invokes the terminology so often used by religion &#8211; &#8220;chapter and verse&#8221;, he is in effect showing his hand and science has become faith based just like religion. In other words, citing chapter and verse in a scientific journal is an appeal to authority much the same way citing chapter and verse in the Bible is an appeal to authority. Fish argues that science is supposed to be based on evidence not an appeal to authority. Once it becomes cited by chapter and verse, it becomes faith based just like religion.</p>
<p>This is a common argument made by religious people. I have no idea if Stanley Fish is religious or not, but this is not a new argument. The premise of the argument is that proving something by citing a document is qualitatively the same when the document is a scientific paper and when the document is a religious text.</p>
<p>Fish got a million and half emails telling him he was wrong. So he doubled down and tried to explain himself in Part 2. To accomplish this, Fish engages in some sophisticated sophistry and linguistics to sat that there is no such thing as evidence in science nor is there such a thing as data. Really, we can know nothing so science is a circle of fervent believers in a self-fulfilling club. Plus, there might not be an objective truth so science and religion can both be true.</p>
<p>It sounds nutty because it is.</p>
<p>Science is different than religion. Its works can be cited as evidence while religious texts cannot. There is a very good reason for this. A scientific paper uses logic, reason, demonstrable evidence, and experimentation to make its points. Once something has been proved or accepted as a valid scientific principle it no longer needs to be &#8220;proved&#8221; each time it is invoked. It can be cited as chapter and verse for expediency and efficiency of argument. You don&#8217;t have to believe in anything to use science as evidence. However, citing chapter and verse from a religious text is completely circular. The religious text may be false, subjectively interpreted, or invented by humans. There is no authority attached to the text unless one subjectively gives the text that authority. It is exactly like citing a work of fiction as authority.</p>
<p>Fish is correct that there is much to learn from sacred texts even if they are works of fiction. Literary criticism is an important discipline and can teach us a lot about our world and provide great lessons for life. But they are subjective lessons and personal to each individual. They cannot be cited as objective authority. This is why citing chapter and verse to religious texts is not as convincing as citing chapter and verse in a scientific study. One is objective, the other subjective.</p>
<p>As a believer, I find my religious texts binding and authoritative. I can, and should cite religious texts when discussing my religious beliefs with fellow believers. But if I am arguing with a non-believer, those religious texts are not only irrelevant, they are weak when compared with science. If I want to make a point to a non-believer I need objective data. I can cite chapter and verse to a study to make an objective argument. I cannot cite chapter and verse to a religious text to make an objective argument.</p>
<p>It is counter-productive for believers to think their beliefs are able to be proved objectively. This only engenders a false sense of security, condescension towards non-believers or believers in other religions, and vulnerability to the difficulties presented by objective inquiry into religious beliefs. Instead, believers should emphasize that their religion is a framework for dealing with life&#8217;s challenges and its religious texts are valuable to those who believe in them. When determining whether it is reasonable to believe in an ancient text whose Authorship cannot be proved, one should take all factors into account and accept that in the end, belief in God or ancient texts will never be as compelling or convincing as a scientific study but that does not really matter.</p>
<p>Just because a scientist used the words &#8220;chapter and verse&#8221; in an argument does not make science a new faith based religion. Science and religion answer different questions using different methodologies. Pretending they are the same or similar in their approach to evidence is a fallacy that helps no one.</p>

Need help answering a question? Ask your friends on Facebook or Twitter! Everyone is doing it. Even <a href="http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2012/03/crowdsourcing-bear.html" target="_blank">Rabbi Slifkin is crowdsourcing for his animal encyclopedia</a>. (Give him a hand if you can&#8230;)</p>
<p>The NY Times Ethicist is also crowdsourcing. The Ethicist wants to hear the strongest case for eating meat. What right does a human being have to kill and eat a living animal?</p>
<p>Truthfully, this is a great question. I have thought about this before and believe that I have come to an important conclusion.</p>
<p>Some of you might think this is a ridiculous question. If you fall under this category, you are probably a religious person.<span id="more-5300"></span> That&#8217;s because some religious people don&#8217;t need a separate justification for eating meat.</p>
<p>For example, in Judaism, built into the system is the idea that there is a Creator. The Creator made a world with a hierarchy. The lower levels on the hierarchy were created to help the higher levels achieve perfection in this world. So plants and animals were created specifically so that they can help man become better people. The food, clothing, and shelter they provide are ours to enjoy responsibly. We are not permitted to waste or abuse other creations, but we are supposed to use them appropriately to aid us in living our lives. If they are used properly, we are giving them a greater purpose than they would have had if they were not used at all.</p>
<p>It goes one level deeper. One of the most important aspects of the Flood Story is that Noah saved the animals. It&#8217;s not just that he survived, but he survived along with the animals. According to some sources, until Noah saved the animals from the Flood, one was not allowed to kill for meat. If an animal was found dead, it could be eaten. Only once the animals were indebted to Noah was he permitted to kill them to eat their meat, responsibly This also may help explain why Noah saved 7 (or 7 pairs) of kosher animals. Their debt is greater than the other animals and therefore we are given permission to eat them. The other animals can only be used for non-food benefits.</p>
<p>This is very important. It means that without a moral imperative from God, there is no right to kill animals. It also means that when we do kill animals it must be done responsibly.</p>
<p>The problem arises for those who do not have moral code from a Creator. Because then, morality is based on our reasoning. I don&#8217;t believe I have seen a rational argument that explains why it is okay to kill animals to eat them. The Ethicist is right. What is the justification for an atheist to eat meat? Is it just &#8220;tradition&#8221;? That&#8217;s weak. Is it because we are stronger and more advanced? Is that really a justification? I am very curious to see what kind of responses are submitted. Personally, I think it is impossible to ethically justify eating meat if you don&#8217;t believe in God. But I am anxious to see if I can be persuaded that I am wrong.</p>
<p>If you have any great ideas, share them with us and send them to The Ethicist.</p>

With an emphasis on furious. Noted author and trailblazer Yitta Halberstam wrote what might be the most universally offensive article about shidduchim that the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Ms. Halberstam is best known for co-authoring the &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1598698419/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1598698419" target="_blank">Small Miracles</a>&#8221; series of books. She was also featured in an article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/04/nyregion/working-world-grows-for-orthodox-women-new-fields-and-strict-judaism-coexist.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm" target="_blank">NY Times</a> about orthodox Jewish women breaking gender boundaries (something <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/20/unorthodox-book-review-and-analysis/" target="_blank">Deborah Feldman</a> could have benefited from). This weekend, however, she set off a &#8220;small firestorm&#8221; and pushed gender equality backward by a couple generations.</p>
<p>The Jewish Press published an article penned by Ms. Halberstam. If you have not yet read the article, please click here and read <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/family/purim-and-the-tyranny-of-beauty-a-plea-to-mothers-of-girls-in-shidduchim/2012/03/19/0/" target="_blank">Purim and the Tyranny of Beauty</a>, then come back here.</p>
<p><em>Caveat: It is possible that this article is satire. A Purim joke. If it is, then the joke is on me and all the people who missed the joke. If anyone knows with certainty that this article is or is not satire please let us all in on the joke. </em><em>Thanks. Either way, this is a superb example of something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poes_law" target="_blank">Poe&#8217;s Law</a>. Even if it is satire, the article raises real issues that are analyzed in this post.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-5291"></span></p>
<p>The article is so bad that I am not even going to attempt to address everything in there. For the sake of brevity, just assume that whatever raised your eyebrows and blood pressure, did the same to thousands of others. There are a few areas of discussion that I think are particularly important to cover.</p>
<p>First, the details. Let&#8217;s just get straight to it. Ms. Halberstam is actually suggesting that young women undergo elective surgery to fix their bodies. Yes. If a girl is not married in her early 20&#8242;s it&#8217;s probably because her nose is too big. Does it get any more superficial than that? It does not.</p>
<p>Let me count the ways that this is offensive and just plain wrong. Isn&#8217;t one of the points of dating for marriage via the shidduch system to avoid the superficiality of dating purely based on looks? Where do these guys come off being so picky about looks? Why are we playing into this stupidity? Don&#8217;t the Tzitz Eliezer and R&#8217; Shlomo Zalman prohibit elective surgery purely for the sake of beauty? (Yes, I know there are others who permit it. But since when is Ms. Halberstam qualified to decide this matter of dispute between the poskim?!) Does Ms. Halberstam know that some people are happy with their looks and don&#8217;t think they should cow to social pressure to look a certain (superficial) way? I mean, seriously, say it out loud: &#8220;An orthodox Jewish woman is advocating plastic surgery to improve normal girls&#8217; appearances&#8221;. Does this sound right to you?</p>
<p>Another detail. The girls who came to this meeting are an excellent case study. As an aside, Ms. Halberstam embarrasses them. She calls many of them plain-looking. This is not very nice. And it&#8217;s also very superficial. The whole point of meeting people in person is to get to know them and not make snap judgments based on their appearance. Ms. Halberstam fails at this. Miserably.</p>
<p>Then there are the girls. Why, in fact, didn&#8217;t they wear make-up? I venture to guess it is because of their Bais Yaakov education. In that world, cosmetics are often portrayed as the Yetzer Hara. They are to be avoided at all costs. The ones who do wear a little make-up are the &#8220;modern&#8221; girls. So is it any wonder that they don&#8217;t just transform from asexual teens to young women in touch with their femininity? Hardly. A similar problem, that is far more serious, occurs after marriage. It is very difficult for the &#8220;good girls&#8221; to adjust from complete insularity from sexuality to a healthy marriage. I bet that most of the girls at the meeting didn&#8217;t want the prospective mothers in law to think they were &#8220;loose&#8221; by charedi standards. I think if the girls were given more leeway in high school and &#8220;looking good&#8221; was not the work of the devil, there might be less reluctance to wearing make-up at a meeting of women.</p>
<p>The most important discussion about this article is the big picture. The current yeshivish shidduch system is a hybrid system. It is a combination of the almost arranged marriages of the most insular communities of the past and the common dating system of the West. In the hybrid system the parents vet potential mates, most of whom they do not know, and then the young adults go on a sufficient number of dates and if all goes well they get engaged.</p>
<p>There are advantages to this system. It avoids a lot of heartache and also the time spent trying to meet appropriate people. I used to think the system was the best possible system. And when it works, it just might be. But we are now seeing what happens when it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>What is happening now is best compared to &#8220;Crony Capitalism&#8221;. There are &#8220;haves&#8221; who get tons of girls recommended to them and there are &#8220;have nots&#8221; who sit around praying for a call. The &#8220;haves&#8221; get their choice of hundreds of prospective girls who stay the same age no matter how old he gets. The &#8220;have nots&#8221; try to find a match from the reject pile. Not to mention the levels of protexia and shmearing required to get a girl&#8217;s name into the hands of a sought after guy.</p>
<p>The girls are left with no leverage. They cannot look for a guy. The system requires that the guy choose the girl. And by guy, I mean the guy&#8217;s mother. There is almost never a list of guys waiting for a &#8220;yes&#8221; from a girl.</p>
<p>This is not a minor issue. Any system where the &#8220;haves&#8221; are spoiled by their riches will become corrupt. In this case, the corruption is in the narcissism of the boys (really their mothers). They become obsessed with getting the perfect match because they can. This obsession leads to lists, résumés, and many of the problems we are facing today.</p>
<p>Another issue is the attempt to adopt the model of almost arranged marriages. I am suspicious that when this was done in the shtetl, the parents knew the prospective match. They knew each other from around town. They knew their children well and they knew the other young men and women as well. In this kind of environment parental input is not only valid, it can be extremely useful.</p>
<p>But in our world, where young men study in yeshiva and young women study in seminary (and usually change a lot of their ideas in that year) and potential matches are made from across the globe, parental input no longer means what it used to mean. It is even possible, or likely, that parental input could be harmful. They may not know their children as well as they think they do. And that&#8217;s okay. But when the decision maker for whom to date is not on the same page as the decision maker for whom to marry, the results can be uneven or worse, catastrophic. Further, parents love their children. A lot. They will take the time to vet hundreds of potential mates to a degree that no one would dream of doing for their self. Parents are too dedicated. In this case I think it turns into a flaw.</p>
<p>I think, a limited parental involvement is wise, but parent overlords are becoming a bigger problem. But I think that is also a <em>symptom</em> of a larger problem. Many orthodox young couples are supported by their parents and in-laws. Since the parents have such a stake in the outcome, they are given a larger role. Perhaps if marriage was something that came after financial independence, parents would have a lesser role. And I think that would be a good thing.</p>
<p>You might ask how in the world young men and women will get married if their mommies are not taking care of all the work. There are two answers. First, young men will date more willingly without all the superficial vetting. They don&#8217;t care about all that stuff nearly as much as their parents. So the logjam will loosen. Dates will happen more freely. Idiotic details won&#8217;t make or break a potential date. I think this would help a lot.</p>
<p>But the best solution remains the proposal by Rabbi Steven Pruzansky in the Jewish Press last summer. In <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/what-we-can-learn-from-chazal-about-dating/2011/07/07/" target="_blank">What We Can Learn From Chazal About Dating</a>, Rabbi Pruzansky suggests social opportunities for young singles to meet each other. This will increase their pool of friends from one gender to two. I think it is obvious that things will sort themselves out from there. This should be the system. In this future world, people get to know each other in a relaxed setting. There are no résumés, no built-in advantage for the guys, no proud mothers turning away the &#8220;riffraff&#8221;, no 180 degree turn from avoiding the other gender to cultivated a loving relationship with the other gender on demand, and as Rabbi Pruzansky so eloquently says, it is living by the dicta of Chazal.</p>
<p>I hope it becomes the yeshivish system before long. If it does, hopefully we will save our daughters from the horrors of self-image obsession that turn into eating disorders and elective surgery before one can buy a beer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/western_religious_symbols.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5278" title="western_religious_symbols" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/western_religious_symbols.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="167" /></a>Remember Tapps? Tapps is the governing body of Texas parochial schools including Beren Academy. A few weeks ago they became a household name after they refused to adjust their tournament schedule out of deference to Beren&#8217;s observance of Shabbos. Everyone from CNN, the NY Times, ESPN, and others reported the story and eventually Tapps acquiesced. Beren played Friday afternoon and won. They moved on to the championship on Saturday night and lost in the final game.</p>
<p>At the time, some people accused Tapps of anti-Semitism. I didn&#8217;t feel like it was anti-Semitism as much as it was myopia and insensitivity to others. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/28/beren-academy-forfeits-tournament-game-because-of-shabbos-and-the-world-reacts/">Beren Academy Forfeits Tournament Game Because of Shabbos and the World Reacts</a>).</p>
<p>The NY Times decided to do a little digging and has made some interesting discoveries. While Tapps may not be anti-Semitic on its face, some new information forces us to reconsider.<span id="more-5277"></span></p>
<p>It seems that not only did Tapps make life difficult for a Jewish school, Beren, but they have made it impossible, if not extremely degrading, for Muslim schools to join Tapps. While their decisions with regard to the Jewish school were ambiguous, their actions toward the Muslim schools can only be described as bigoted.</p>
<p>One school was given the opportunity to be considered for acceptance in Tapps and was asked to fill out a questionnaire. No  non-Muslim schools were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The queries on the questionnaire were also quite offensive. Here are some of the nuggets discovered by NY Times:</p>
<p><em>Historically, there is nothing in the Koran that fully embraces Christianity or Judaism in the way a Christian and/or a Jew understands his religion. Why, then, are you interested in joining an association whose basic beliefs your religion condemns?”</em></p>
<p><em>It is our understanding that the Koran tells you not to mix with (and even eliminate) the infidels. Christians and Jews fall into that category. Why do you wish to join an organization whose membership is in disagreement with your religious beliefs?</em></p>
<p><em>How does your school address certain Christian concepts? (i.e. celebrating Christmas)</em></p>
<p><em>When was the Bible allegedly polluted? Does the Koran actually state that the Bible is polluted?</em></p>
<p><em>What is your attitude about the spread of Islam in America? What are the goals of your school in this regard?</em></p>
<p>The school answered the questionnaire and was still not accepted into Tapps.</p>
<p>Tapps also sent a survey to the other schools asking questions like &#8220;would you leave the association if Muslim schools were included?&#8221;and &#8220;Is it in the best interest of Tapps to accept Islamic schools for membership?&#8221;. The results may be even more disturbing. 67% of respondents felt Muslim schools should not be allowed in Tapps.</p>
<p>There are multiple levels to this. First, Tapps is clearly not a friendly place for non-Christians. They are fervent in their beliefs and the beliefs of others not acceptable to them. They don&#8217;t play on their Sabbath, but refused to acknowledge the Jewish Sabbath. They believe that Muslims and Jews are doomed because they do not accept Jesus. (Generally, Christians really believe this, it says so in the <a href="http://www.openbible.info/topics/non_believers" target="_blank">Bible</a>, just many Christians don&#8217;t act on these beliefs in the public sphere.) But they challenge those same beliefs in others. These beliefs are abhorrent and are not acceptable in 2012. One can, <em>no, one must,</em> be fervently religious without being hateful toward other religions.</p>
<p>I am sure there are some of you who think that the questions asked of Muslims are legitimate. I have a few things to say to you. First of all, this is sports league, not a religious debate league. It should not matter one bit what the beliefs of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are with regard to anything other than the scheduling and executing of the league schedule. The idea that the Muslim schools need to be &#8220;vetted&#8221; just so that they could play in the same league is extremely xenophobic.</p>
<p>Second, a questionnaire is not appropriate even if the league were a debate of religion league. They betray a deeply held prejudice against non-members of Christianity in general and an even deeper prejudice for Islam. These kids are living in Texas, not Saudi Arabia! Obviously their parents are more comfortable in a free country like America than they would be in a fascist country. Further, they are asking to play basketball, a Western game. They just want to be American kids. The questioning is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Third the particular questions are even more inappropriate. All religions condemn other religions. That&#8217;s a fact of religions. Move on. Accept it. The Christmas question is hilarious. Christians have asked me with incredulity &#8220;You don&#8217;t celebrate Christmas?!&#8221;. That&#8217;s right. Non-Christians don&#8217;t celebrate Christmas. Why is this an issue? The question that gives it all away is the last one. The &#8220;spread of Islam&#8221; is an irrational fear that has become a deeply rooted fundamental belief of non-Muslims. American Muslims who I know and talk to about these issues have no such agenda. Sure, there are insane fundamentalists who live in backwards, oppressed countries who want to convert the entire world to Islam. They have nothing to do with normal American Muslims. But thanks to the tireless efforts of heroes like Pam Geller, the average, bigoted, non-thinking, Christian American actually thinks that his religious beliefs are under siege from normal American Muslims. This is hate. Pure and simple.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t really blame Tapps. They are just buying what their heroes are selling. I blame those who are selling it. The best way that I know of eliminating hate is by getting to know one another. When people who are different on the outside get to know each other, preconceived notions are burst and understanding and appreciating can begin. The unfortunate result of Tapps&#8217; bigotry is that it reinforces itself by discouraging their schools from increased interaction with the Muslim students. No interaction means no opportunities to unlearn their bigotry. But perhaps that is what Tapps wanted all along.</p>
<p>Although I was willing to overlook Tapps&#8217; faux pas with regard to Beren as simple-mindedness, I am now changing my opinion and declaring them general bigots towards anyone not of the same religious beliefs as them. In 2012 this is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for Christians in Texas and it is unacceptable for Jews and Muslims as well. We are all part of a global community now. Deal with each other in a civil way or go away.</p>

So they will comply and Beren can play!</p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://www.chron.com/sports/article/Beren-Academy-allowed-to-play-state-semifinal-3374028.php" target="_blank">Houston Chronicle</a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Beren Academy of Houston is a modern orthodox day school. I know several of their alumni and respect the school greatly.</p>
<p>By now you&#8217;ve probably heard the news that the Beren Academy has a superb high school basketball team and that they made it to the semi-finals of their league. The next game is scheduled for Friday night. The team refuses to play on Shabbos and asked for a special dispensation to enable them to play before Shabbos. The request was denied and the team has forfeited the game thus ending their season.</p>
<p>This story has been reported everywhere from the NY Times to ESPN.</p>
<p>The reactions have been mixed. Everyone who is Shabbos observant sees this sacrifice as a kiddush Hashem. Many of us are able to be Shabbos observant without sacrificing anything other than NCAA football, golfing with corporate bigwigs, or other less than vital activities. Compared to my great grandfather who lost his job every Saturday and was kicked out of his home by his sisters for keeping Shabbos, we have it easy. These Beren students are throwbacks to a an era where Shabbos observance was more difficult than it is today. Their commitment to Shabbos and Judaism is inspiring.<span id="more-5203"></span></p>
<p>Those who are not Shabbos observant see this as an impressive commitment to something they do not fully appreciate. But it reminds them that there is more to life and sports than winning.</p>
<p>What gets interesting is the reaction to the denied request for rescheduling. Some people are calling this anti-Semitism. I disagree. Sort of.</p>
<p>The school knew in advance that the tournament was scheduled over Shabbos. They were told in advance that the tournament would not be changed to accommodate them. There is no reason to expect that the tournament would adjust when Beren knew going in that the tournament was not going to be adjusted. To make the claim that the tournament stuck to its original proposal that Beren agreed to, rises to anti-Semitism is absurd.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it could be argued that the original agreement was biased by a soft anti-Semitism. Beren did agree that they would be forced to forfeit in the event a game occurred on Shabbos. But why did it have to be this way? Wouldn&#8217;t it be appropriate to accommodate the Jewish team that abides by their religious beliefs and will not play on Shabbos? I think it would have been prudent for the tournament organizers to agree beforehand to accommodate. Once the agreement not to accommodate was established it is disingenuous to expect that they would change it simply to avoid the appearance of anti-Semitism. It would have been preferable if the agreement was to allow them to change the game but that was simply not the case.</p>
<p>Making matters worse is the fact that this league refuses to play on Sunday due to the very religious beliefs of the other schools. It seems incongruous to insist that the Jewish team be forced to concede on their Sabbath and the Christian teams are banned from playing on their Sabbath. One would hope that members of other religions could appreciate the religion of the other. But sometimes religious people are nearsighted and only see their religion as religious. It could that is what happened here. I wouldn&#8217;t classify myopia as anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>It is also wrong to say &#8220;if this were a Muslim school of Seventh Day Adventist school the tournament would have accommodated.&#8221; This is complete conjecture and I venture to say that with a prior agreement in hand, the result would have been the same. Not everything is anti-Semitism. In fact, most things are not.</p>
<p>Or maybe it speaks to a different anti-Semitic bias. Who could have predicted that the Jewish school would have such good athletes&#8230;? The prior agreement was never expected to make a difference!</p>
<p>In any event, the story is heartwarming. It reminds us of our commitment to Shabbos. It reminds us that sometimes being a Shabbos observer means giving something up. Hopefully the lesson will be a positive one for the kids at Beren. Hopefully it will not lead to resentment over missing the opportunity to win a championship and will instead reinforce their strength of conviction to Shabbos.</p>
<p>The fact that this story has struck a chord and is being reported in the biggest new outlets speaks to the novelty of this story. The articles I have seen have all been respectful and admiring. Especially when contrasted with the horrible news out of the high school in Ohio, these kids look like heroes. At the very least, Shabbos is making positive headlines. We can be thankful for that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that with all the press, the tournament will acquiesce. I would be happy for the team if this happens. But I don&#8217;t love the idea of whiny Jews getting their way. Hopefully, if the tournament relents, that will not be the narrative. Instead the narrative will be religious tolerance, conviction of belief, good basketball.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_5165" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wedding.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5165" title="wedding" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wedding-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Oded Balilty</p></div>
<p>One of the starkest differences between orthodox Jews and others can be observed at a wedding. The orthodox Jewish wedding is really two weddings. One for the men and one for women. They are in the same place but in today&#8217;s society, they eat and dance while completely separated. It can seem strange. But in another sense it can be quite beautiful.</p>
<p>The beauty comes from seeing a large gathering of people, usually orthodox Jewish wedding parties are attended by several hundred people, all joined together for one holy purpose. Marriage is a very important milestone in orthodox Judaism and the awe, reverence, and respect according the event creates a very special atmosphere.</p>
<p>The unity of the event can also be seen superficially by the uniform standards of dress. Everyone dresses conservatively and they kind of blend together. When one pulls back, it can be visually stunning. Especially to an outsider.</p>
<p>An outsider had a unique opportunity to photograph a superstar wedding in Israel. Oded Balilty is a Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist. He lives right around Bnei Brak but his world is very different. Take a look at his perspective from behind the lens of this world that is closer to his own than he realizes. The photos are on the NY Times website today and they are amazing. His commentary is excellent as well.</p>
<p>Check out the photos on the NY Times Lens Blog: <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/so-close-yet-so-far/" target="_blank">So Close, Yet So Far</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion-and-politics2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5104" title="religion-and-politics2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion-and-politics2.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Politicians from the Right often cite God or Jesus as a basis for political positions. Some even make the claim that they are running for office upon the advise of God Himself.</p>
<p>Now, it is impossible for God to have told more than one particular person that they are destined to be the next president. So either all but one are lying or they are all lying. You decide.</p>
<p>Either way, the whole concept of appealing to God&#8217;s authority in politics is very silly. The reason it is silly is because none of these people have had any specific revelation. Rather, they apply their interpretations of ancient texts, or worse, their personal feelings or emotional stirrings and claim that these are Divine messages. What makes matters even fuzzier is that politicians are usually businessmen or lawyers. They are not theologians or members of the clergy. Their understanding of their own religions is as basic as the average American&#8217;s understanding of their religions. Their understanding of other religions is even poorer.</p>
<p>Case in point: President Obama invoked the teachings of Jesus as a basis for taxes. The response has been vicious. Most of the criticism has been because of the seeming transparent pandering to the religious voters. This is a valid criticism. But only to a point. Politicians are professional panderers. We just don&#8217;t like it when <em>we can tell</em>.</p>
<p>The more important point, that is being overlooked, is how religious beliefs are able to conform to political positions. <span id="more-5102"></span>It&#8217;s too easy to make an argument for almost any predetermined position using religious faith or texts. The stories are obscure, the analogies are tenuous and the bias is overwhelming. It&#8217;s to the point that I can&#8217;t take any appeal to religion seriously. Further, not everyone <em>wants </em>to follow the teachings of Jesus. Those same teachings were used as a tool for death and destruction for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Are taxes some form of charity, as Obama suggests? Maybe. But religion is not going to provide the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Political policy should be based on reasoning that is free from religious influence. It should not be guided by love for God or religion nor should it be guided by disbelief in God or hatred for religion.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t blame politicians. I blame the religious fervor of American citizens that demands that their politicians double as religious leaders. It&#8217;s foolish to assume that politicians know enough about religion to have intelligent opinions on theological matters. We should stop demanding it. Along the same lines, we should not turn to one specific version of a religion to solve our problems or as a basis for setting policy. At best, it is silly and at worse it is offensive.</p>
<p>I think the other speaker at the event at which the president spoke had good advice. Eric Metaxas suggested we remove phony religiosity from public discourse. Since it is all phony, I say we remove it all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tznius-modesty.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5061" title="tznius-modesty" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tznius-modesty-300x222.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="222" /></a>So much excellent writing has come forth due to the controversy over Beit Shemesh and Meah Shearim. This week two additions to the genre found themselves at the top of the heap.</p>
<p>Both authors are rabbis. Neither are rabbis that are appreciated or recognized by anyone (or almost no-one) in the right wing orthodox Jewish community. That&#8217;s a shame because their message is valuable for the RWOJ community and they will not read or pay heed to these articles because they come from outside.</p>
<p>There is room to quibble over details within these articles but I think we can all agree that the sentiments are important and at the very least deserve a response if not agreement.</p>
<p>The first article was written by Rabbi Marc Angel. In his article, Rabbi Angel proposes modern tznius guidelines that do not change halacha but do change social expectations. In his words:<span id="more-5060"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The goal should be to create frameworks for normal interactions between men and women, where men and women conduct themselves properly without reducing each other to mere objects of sexual attraction.</em></p>
<p>Two things. First of all, I don&#8217;t think this is a fair characterization. I don&#8217;t think the complete social separation of men and women automatically reduces people to sex object. I do think this is one possible result of many.</p>
<p>Second of all, this is never going to happen. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>I once made a relevant comment to a friend of mine as we observed a kiddush celebrating the birth of a child / grandchild in a home where there were separate entrances for men and women and once inside, the men were in one room and the women were in a completely separate room. We were discussing the difference between this kind of celebration and one outside the RWOJ community. Absolute separation of married men and women is seen as necessary in the RWOJ. The rationale is usually something like &#8220;if men and women fraternize together, it will lead to sin&#8221;. But the truth is that men and women socialize together all the time and they don&#8217;t sin. Yet, this perception persists in the RWOJ community.</p>
<p>Rabbi Angel hits it on the head. RWOJ do not envision a framework for men and women to engage in normal interactions. If this changes then perhaps other things will change too. I just don&#8217;t see it happening.</p>
<p>The second article is much more prominent as it appeared in the NY Times. This article was written by Rabbi Dov Linzer, the Rosh Yeshiva of Chovevei Torah which makes his words less meaningful than a republican senator in the eyes of a RWOJ. But he also makes some good points that are worth exploring.</p>
<p>In making his main point, Rabbi Linzer raises the conundrum of sexual purity in the religious context: Who is responsible for licentious thoughts about immodest women?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;the Talmud, the basis for Jewish law, offers a perhaps surprising answer: It places the responsibility for controlling men’s licentious thoughts about women squarely on the men.</em></p>
<p>This is true and as Rabbi Linzer develops this point he places the focus on men who over-sexualize women as opposed to women who may not dress in accordance with tradition.</p>
<p>Although, I would add that halacha in general speaks to men. There is no section in the Talmud or Code of Jewish Law that tells women how they should dress and behave in the public sphere. It is only in from the perspective of the men that we are given clues to what is expected of women. So, it is hard to draw definitive conclusions from omissions in the sources on this matter.</p>
<p>But all in all, I do agree with Rabbi Linzer. However, it is unfortunate that this is in the NY Times. At least it has not made their list of Most E-Mailed Articles.</p>
<p>I realize that these article will read like Chinese to RWOJs who measure skirt length with a tznius ruler and examine the denier of stockings. But maybe, just maybe, if an opposite perspective presented eloquently and forcefully the attitudes will slowly change.</p>
<p>Please read and share these articles. At the very least they will engender (hehe) discussion about these issues in a meaningful way. If you go to RWOJ shul, see what happens if you print these articles and give them to some friends in shul. That might be interesting&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4988" title="stop-sign" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" /></a>Thugs and hoodlums from extremist religious groups in Israel have been terrorizing fellow Jews for some time now. They have done so without fear of condemnation or retribution from the religiously adjacent charedi community. This recent wave of violence is not new nor is it shocking or surprising.</p>
<p>Spitting on young girls, calling women whores, forcing segregation at bus stops and on buses are all acts cut from the same cloth as the violence at Manny&#8217;s Bookshop and a political beating in Meah Shearim. We&#8217;ve known about this for a while. Nobody has said a word.</p>
<p>However, this time the media found out about it. So now it&#8217;s national and international news.</p>
<p>This has prompted responses and condemnations from rabbis, rabbinic authorities and lay people. That&#8217;s great. Finally. The problem is that these condemnations are so weak, hedged and long-winded that they, in my opinion, are a failure.</p>
<p>There is only one way to condemn violence and abuse towards women. That would be something like this:<span id="more-4987"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>We strongly condemn any and all violence towards women under any and all circumstances. Those who commit such acts of violence will feel the full effect and power of the religious and secular court system. They will be excommunicated from all religious circles and are heretofore to be considered persona non grata. If you know of any individuals who have abused anyone, whether verbally or physically notify the police and rabbinic leadership immediately.</strong></p>
<p>What we don&#8217;t need is an explanation of how these people are not &#8220;real charedim&#8221;. We don&#8217;t need poetry on the majesty of tznius. We don&#8217;t need snide remarks about the secular media. Just speak out against violence, promise retribution and to take action.</p>
<p>Enough with the apologetics and handwringing.</p>
<p><em>Feel free to copy and paste my version of an appropriate condemnation on all the blogs and news sites that have published the watered down condemnations to this point. If you can, please credit this blog. Thanks.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/pointing-finger.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4844" title="pointing-finger" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/pointing-finger-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>The moral outrage over the Penn State scandal is reaching epic proportions. In the NY Times, David Brooks raises a salient point and it got me thinking. Brooks says that humans have a bad track record of speaking up when something needs to be said.</p>
<p>Everyone is horrified by the heinous acts alleged to have been committed by Jerry Sandusky. But there is another level of disdain for Joe Paterno, Mike McQueary and the police that investigated the accusations over the years. These people all contributed to the abuse. They either created or fostered an environment that tolerated abuse. They did not follow through on their professional responsibilities. They let the victims down.</p>
<p>It is easy to point the finger at these guilty parties and say they were wrong. It is also easy to say that if we were in their situation we would have acted more responsibly. Maybe many of us would have acted differently. We have no way of knowing for sure.</p>
<p>Similarly, we point fingers laced in guilt at the complicit parties in the Catholic Church scandal. I know there is the same sentiment among many orthodox Jews regarding abuse in the orthodox Jewish community. The finger pointers always say that they would not have covered it up. They would have done the moral thing and blown the whistle. Maybe they would have. But we we have no way of knowing for sure.<span id="more-4843"></span></p>
<p>My point is that this is the third scandal with the same kind of structure. An infallible leadership, concern over reputation, self imposed regulation and policing etc and all three scandals followed the same form.</p>
<p>Someone finds out about the abuse and the information is locked down. Nothing is done for years.</p>
<p>I used to be <em>really</em> mad at people who know about abuse and don&#8217;t say anything. I am still mad, but less mad. It seems that this cycle is almost inevitable. The people who did the covering up are just like you and me. They probably never thought they would not blow the whistle either. But it is not as easy as it seems.</p>
<p>When things happen and we judge others based on what we would have done, we are being disingenuous. There is no way for us to know if we would have had the courage to act in the way we think we would have acted.</p>
<p>Hillel, one of the great rabbis of the Mishna says: &#8220;<em>Don&#8217;t judge your friend until you reach his place. [And you will never </em><em>reach his place</em>.]&#8221; &#8211; Avos 2:5</p>
<p>The point is that we can all feel morally superior but we have no idea if we would have actually acted differently.</p>
<p>Our true anger should be directed at the systems that allow such a casual approach to such horrible things. The people who are in the system and don&#8217;t say anything are just part of a corrupt system. Sure, their complicity gives them a role in the system too. But I think it is very hard to buck an entire system. It is hard to swim upstream. It is hard to blow that whistle. That is why the whistle blowers are such heroes.</p>
<p>So in retrospect, looking at the feelings of anger and resentment I had toward the people in the institutions who did not do everything in their power to curb abuse, I feel differently now. I see a pattern that almost does not allow for whistle blowing. I am still upset that they did not do the right thing, but I can understand better how hard it is.</p>
<p>But this only increases my anger and disdain for the &#8220;system&#8221;. A system that is structured perfectly for predators will have predators. The system is bad, it is to blame, and must be fixed. The NCAA will look at their system, the Catholic Church has looked at their system and orthodox Judaism has also been looking at their system. But it will take courage to fix the system so that these heinous acts do not repeat themselves and force us to count on heroism.</p>
<p>We should not need to rely on heroes to save children from abuse. That is the most horrible thing about abuse in these communities. To protect children we are relying on heroes. We should be able to rely on the system.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/salt-lake-mormon-temple.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4833" title="salt-lake-mormon-temple" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/salt-lake-mormon-temple-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>A couple of weeks ago the New York Times featured a Fashion and Style article that caught my attention. I never read that section. But the headline grabbed me because it was not really about fashion or style. It was about religion and Mormons in particular.</p>
<p>The article talked about modern Mormons trying to fit in with their non-Mormon social circles.</p>
<p>I have a &#8220;thing&#8221; with Mormons.</p>
<p>Of all the religions in the world, I think the closest religion to Orthodox Judaism in many respects is Mormonism. I don&#8217;t mean in a theoligical sense. I mean in a practical, real world sense.</p>
<p>The kinds of challenges and successes that Mormons have resemble that of orthodox Jews. Both are minority religions in a predominantly &#8220;Traditional Christian&#8221; country. Both give their adherents opportunities to thrive in the modern world. But both also have a bit of a tradition of reluctance to modernity. So it is striking that both have embraced modernity in their own ways.<span id="more-4832"></span></p>
<p>Brigham Young University is a Mormon college. It strikes me as being very similar to Yeshiva University or even my alma mater, Ner Israel. I wrote about that sometime a while back: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/02/the-byu-honor-code-and-me/">The BYU Honor Code and Me</a></p>
<p>To me the article in the NY Times sounded a lot like Modern Orthodox Judaism. Young people who aspire to achieve success in the secular world who are also extremely restricted by their religion within that secular world. The restrictions are different between but they are similar as well.</p>
<p>For example: Clothing. Mormons are required to wear modest clothing on the outside but also a religious article of clothing on the inside. Orthodox Jews have the same. Different in the details but similar in spirit.</p>
<p>Another example: Social Drinking. Alcohol plays a huge social role. Parties serve alcohol, bars are frequent places of meeting and Mormons are forbidden from drinking alcohol altogether. Orthodox Jews are allowed to drink. But there are many restrictions that prevent (perhaps by design) absolute fraternization with non-Jews. Wine must be kosher. Mixed drinks must contain only kosher ingredients. Social drinking can be cumbersome.</p>
<p>I think these sort of parallels reflect a greater parallel between the two religions. This all leads me to one important thing to consider.</p>
<p>We live in a country that is predominately Christian. By and large, Christians have been wonderful friends to the Jews and particularly to Israel. But there is always the sneaking suspicion that we are still &#8220;the other&#8221;. I know I sense it. Similarly, Mormons have also been subjected to feeling like &#8220;the other&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am not criticizing anyone for making Jews or Mormons feel like &#8220;the other&#8221;. I am just saying that it exists and sometimes it rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>Rick Perry&#8217;s campaign has managed to make both Jews and Mormons feel significantly like &#8220;the other&#8221;. First Jews at his Prayer Rally and then Mormons when a member of his staff said some not-nice things about Mormons.</p>
<p>So Mormons, we know how you feel, in more ways than one&#8230;</p>

<p>It seems silly to me that numerology is so important to some people. It reminds me of the Ibn Ezra from Lech Lecha that berates Rashi for hanging an interpretation on a gematria. In his words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230; the Torah does not speak in gematria, for anyone who desires can use gematria to interpret any name for good and for evil.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>My thoughts exactly.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to do some research and put my NY Times subscription to good use. It turns out that the paper reported on the significance of the date and time.<span id="more-4820"></span> The article also mentions 11/11/1111 but does not expect to find some recording of it because the Monks would not have been so imprecise as to record a date 11/11/1111 in that manner. They would have certainly used November 11, 1111.</p>
<p>The last line is the best line:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As none of us is likely to be living in the 11111, it would be well for those who delight in curious trifles to take their of enjoyment out of this method of dating today, 11-11-11.</em></p>
<p>Seeing as I take no such delight, consider me &#8220;just reporting&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-105203.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4804" title="20111108-105203.jpg" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-105203-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a>A scandal has rocked the NCAA Football landscape. A former Penn State football coach, Jerry Sandusky has been implicated by a grand jury. He is accused of sexually abusing young boys while he worked in an official capacity at the school and while working in an office on campus as part of a non-profit.</p>
<p>His boss was famed and revered football coaching legend Joe Paterno. Paterno is 84 years old. At some point the coach learned of the abuse and reported it to his boss, the Athletic Director. No further action was taken and Sandusky remained on the coaching staff at Penn State. The university administration did not report the abuse to the authorities. As mandated reporters this broke the law. They further complicated their situation by lying to the grand jury. Two administrators have been arrested for perjury failing to report the abuse.</p>
<p>The grand jury testimony contains some very graphic instances of abuse. It truly is horrifying.</p>
<p>An abusive person would be wise to position himself at a university. There is plenty of access to victims and the circumstances of working at a university make it easier to get away with abuse.<span id="more-4799"></span></p>
<p>I think the NCAA can be compared to the Catholic Church and orthodox Judaism to a certain degree. They are each closed environments with their own set of rules, codes and regulations. They give their leaders a lot of autonomy and hardly subject them to public scrutiny. Many of their proceedings and policy decisions are kept secret. And they have all had a hard time dealing with abuse in their communities. <em>(The NCAA is beyond corrupt but that&#8217;s another topic entirely&#8230;)</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, the best way for reluctant leaders to &#8220;repent&#8221; for their missteps with regard to abuse is by taking strong steps to ensure it does not happen anymore.</p>
<p>Many people are clamoring for Paterno to step down or for the university to fire him.</p>
<p>In this situation the most effective course of action will be one that will create a breach in the cone of silence within the NCAA and prevent future misdeeds and harm, especially with regarded to abuse. I don&#8217;t care if the abuse could be attributed to Paterno or not. I don&#8217;t care if Paterno broke the law or not. But I do care that more young boys not be abused in similar situations.</p>
<p>In this light I believe that Paterno should step down and make a strong statement saying that he is sorry for what happened under his watch. He should strongly condemn the acts and admit that his silence was wrong. He should put all abusers on watch and more importantly put all their protectors on watch. He should step down to say that he failed those young men who were abused and because of this he feels he is inadequate to continue in his capacity as Head Coach. He should talk about the horrors of abuse and the compounding effect that silence has upon victims. He should speak loudly and eloquently, like a good football coach.</p>
<p>He should not step down because he is too old nor should he step down because he failed the young men who were abused. He should not be fired for not doing the right thing nor should he be fired for protecting an abusive person. Rather, he should do whatever he can to make sure that the culture that permits abuse will not continue. I think the best way to do that will be for Paterno to use this platform, awareness and outrage to fix things for the future. I believe he can do that and if he would do that he would change his personal legacy from &#8220;abuse enabler&#8221; to &#8220;abuse fighter&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is too late to prevent the abuse that already happened but he can play a role in writing the future story of how the NCAA handles and deals with abuse.</p>
<p>Similarly, the religious institutions that have committed similar acts of tacit approval of abuse should use future or present incidents to make strong statements against abusers and their protectors. For the victims of these institutions and their abusers nothing can be done to change the past but if the institutions are strong enough to take a hard stance on future abuse their legacy in the arena of abuse can be changed forever.</p>
<p>I hope they do.</p>

(It all went down during my blogcation  <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/25/things-i-would-have-blogged-about-in-the-last-ten-days-if-i-were-a-real-blogger/" target="_blank">Things I Would Have Blogged About in the Last Ten Days If I Were a Real Blogger</a>) but didn&#8217;t include in that post because I thought I was going to blog about it anyway. I didn&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>Chua&#8217;s book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202842/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1594202842">Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</a>) is all about pushing your children to the limit. Expecting the most from them and demanding excellence in everything that they do. Allegedly. I have not read it. But I did read about 25 articles talking about the book.</p>
<p>To me it all sounding very similar to [stereotypical] Jewish parenting techniques as well. Push your children, guilt them if they don&#8217;t perform, give them every opportunity to find their special talent, put trophies on the mantel, etc. In fact, Chua is married to a Jewish man.</p>
<p>My thoughts at the time of the book&#8217;s release and articles were complicated, but the overall feeling I had was that there was not enough unconditional love in her parenting. Children need love as much as they need discipline. The world can be a tough place. Children depend on their parents for the confidence to thrive and knowing they are loved is an indispensable tool toward success. It seemed Chua&#8217;s parenting placed a premium on everything but unconditional love.</p>
<p>Now, a passionate, heartfelt, moving op-ed in the NY Times provides some perspective.<span id="more-4715"></span></p>
<p>A mother of a baby with Tay-Sachs disease writes about parenting a child who will not live past the age of three. Of particular interest to Jewish families because the child has Tay-Sachs, a disease that has very high frequency in the Ahskenazik Jewish community that has been mostly quashed by screening, this mother is Irish and the screening that she went through for diseases including Tay-Sachs came back negative.</p>
<p>So she is parenting a baby who will not take music lessons, karate, play soccer, apply to college or do anything remarkable that a Tiger Mom would hang on her Wall of Fame. And the contrast is stark.</p>
<p>It is all love, no discipline, no competition and no Mommy and Me. I think we all can learn from this Dragon Mom and not forget that as much as we want our children to excel, they want our love.</p>
<p>Read the article. I expect it will make you cry. It did for me.</p>

<p>160 years ago a fledgling newspaper printed its first issue. On September 18, 1861 the New York [Daily] Times began its journey from the new kid in town to the old gray lady. It cost one penny.</p>
<p>I really like the NY Times and I am thankful it exists. I know, there are many of you who are positive that the NY Times is anti-Semitic or at least anti-Israel. It is hard for me to see it but even if I did it would not take away from the pleasure I have in reading their articles on every other topic imaginable. I would not boycott reading a newspaper if I sensed a bias in their writing.</p>
<p>I read the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times almost every day. Generally, I prefer the Times.</p>
<p>I went into the NYT Archives and found an article from their first edition. Copyright laws prevent me from posting the entire article, but I will quote a few lines that I found to be profound and an idea that I try to incorporate into my life and writing on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Apparently, in the days before the Times ran its first presses, there was wide speculation as to the nature of the paper. It was praised and denounced in advance of it first issue. The Times described itself thusly:<br />
<span id="more-4629"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Upon all topics, &#8211; Political, Social, Moral and Religious, &#8211; we intend that the paper speak for itself; &#8211; and we only ask that it may be judged accordingly. We shall be Conservative, in all cases where we think Conservatism essential to the public good; &#8211; and we shall be Radical in everything which may seem to us to require radical treatment and radical reform. We do not believe that everything in Society is either exactly right or exactly wrong; &#8211; what is good we desire to preserve and improve; &#8211; what is evil to exterminate or reform.</em></p>
<p>I think this is the precise balance that must prevail in Judaism as well. Sometimes being a Traditionalist or Fundamentalist is necessary and good. Sometimes being a Liberal or Progressive is best. It depends on the situation. It depends on all the relevant facts and factors. Going to either side to the extreme, whether blindly or willfully is not the golden mean that Maimonides speaks of and we all strive toward.</p>
<p>Judaism itself believes that there is nothing intrinsically good and nothing intrinsically evil. Everything depends on the context. Everything depends on how it is used.</p>
<p>Heed these words. Critically analyze everything and don&#8217;t allow yourself to become a slave to only one way of thinking.</p>

For many, the most important part of school is&#8230; what to wear!</p>
<p>Most orthodox Jewish schools have uniforms for the girls and strict dress codes for the boys.</p>
<p>Parents and pupils are known to complain about the limited options for what to wear to school. Girls feel especially limited because there are many schools with very strict rules about accessorizing. (There are exceptions. My father&#8217;s school has a dress code and allows accessories.)</p>
<p>Limiting what girls may and may not wear solves some potential issues but raises another set of issues. Downplaying the individuality of each girl can harm girls&#8217; confidence. Making every girl dress the same can also hinder a teacher&#8217;s ability to pick up on social or hygienic issues among the students.</p>
<p>But most of all, I think girls like getting dressed. It&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s a chance to express one&#8217;s self. Taking away that self expression is a side effect worth considering.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is a problem exclusive to orthodox Jewish schools, I recently learned that many other schools also have dress codes or uniforms and they are dealing with the same issues.<span id="more-4579"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times has an article about how schools are becoming more lax with their dress codes to allow more accessorizing and individuality. Some schools are allowing leggings or yoga pants underneath the mandatory skirts. Uniform manufacturers are also tailoring their clothes to be more flattering. It&#8217;s important that kids feel good about how they look and how they dress. These are all good developments.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest boon of all is the chance for teens to &#8220;rebel within the rules&#8221;. They can dress more quirky or different without breaking the rules. This is an important way to allow teens to breathe and feel freedom. Not all teens feel the need to rebel. Others may rebel outside the rules. But there is certainly a group that feels a need to rebel and is willing to do so within the rules.</p>
<p>Giving students an outlet to release some of their teen angst would be a wise idea for the orthodox Jewish schools as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/busy-brain.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4577" title="busy-brain" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/busy-brain-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>A little while back, the NY Times Magazine published a fascinating article that I think everyone should read.</p>
<p>The article is based on several comprehensive studies about decision making. People make many decisions each day; the data shows that decision making can wear a person down. Not physically as much as mentally.</p>
<p>It turns out that our brains do have something akin to will power and it can be drained and replenished. The studies show that when people are forced to make a multitude of decisions during the course of a day their decision making power can become so markedly diminished that they are to mentally weak to make any more decisions. Instead people will defer or worse, acquiesce to others and allow them to make their decisions for them.</p>
<p>Clearly, this has broad ramifications across the entire spectrum of people and situations.<span id="more-4576"></span> In one study, parolees had a much greater chance of being granted parole if their case was heard early in the day or session. This factor was more decisive than length of sentence or severity of crime in determining whether parole was granted.</p>
<p>Socially, poor people are often criticized for their bad decision making. The proverbial &#8220;buying candy with food stamps&#8221; can also be understood using this data. For middle class and wealthy people, food shopping is not decision intensive. The choices are relatively harmless and don&#8217;t carry much weight. But for people living on a tight budget, each item is an agonizing choice that slowly but surely drains their will power. Eventually, the brain is too tired to make sound choices and impulse buys become too difficult to resist.</p>
<p>There is a strong correlation between the number of significant choices one makes and one&#8217;s general will power. This is one reason dieting is so difficult. After making all the right food choices throughout the day, the brain can become weakened to the point that it cannot withstand the temptation to indulge in &#8220;bad foods&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of the studies is the Mardi Gras Principle. The idea that one can increase will power by indulging before a period of self control is a common one. The data says it works, but only kind of works. Other things are equally effective in boosting self control. Indulgence cannot be excused simply because of subsequent self control.</p>
<p>Jewish philosophy intersects with some of the issues raised in the article. For one, in Judaism one is defined by their choices. Our moral choices is what makes us or breaks us. Since this is so, it is very important that we set ourselves up for success and help ourselves to make the right choices. One needs a strategy to make good choices. The article provides this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;people with the best self-control are the ones who structure their lives so as to conserve willpower. They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it’s available for emergencies and important decisions.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>I agree with all the above. In addition, I think Judaism believes that the self control and decision making abilities we possess can be strengthened through hard work like any other physical capacity. Practice makes <del>perfect</del> better. Judaism helps one to be on the alert for decisions and not allow our brains to cop out and defer or decide poorly. We are to be conscious of our decision making at all times and it is supposed that by working on one&#8217;s self to make good, positive conscious decisions, one will strengthen their decision making prowess and avoid the problems created by decision fatigue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/marriage.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4553" title="marriage" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/marriage.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>The NY Times has a great online section called &#8220;Room for Debate&#8221; in which they enlist writers from a spectrum of views to give their opinion on a particular issue.</p>
<p>The August 30, 2011 issue is: Should Parents Marry for the Kids?</p>
<p>The rules are predetermined. It is a given that a happy, healthy marriage is great for raising kids. The question is if cohabitation is just as good as a marriage for the purposes of raising kids.</p>
<p>The contributors all make good points. Some make bad points too.</p>
<p>One thread that seems to run throughout it is that we are a marriage-centric society. This automatically tips the scales in favor of marriage. But why is marriage better? What is it about saying &#8220;I do&#8221; that could make the relationship a better environment for raising kids?<span id="more-4552"></span></p>
<p>The simple answer is commitment. Marriage connotes a greater commitment than cohabitation. Divorces are painful, expensive and difficult. Couples that are married think twice (or more) before a divorce. The assumption is that if the couple is not getting a divorce they will work on the relationship to the point that it is a stable environment for raising children. However, cohabitation is much easier to sever. Just take your things and leave and it is over. Since it is easier to end the relationship, it is more likely that a child of cohabiting parents will end up living with one parent.</p>
<p>Worse than living with one parent is the shuffling of parent figures. Single parents are people too. They have a need for relationships and those needs can turn into several different partners over the course of a childhood. This can be traumatic.</p>
<p>Since cohabitation ends up being shorter than a marriage, more often than not, many of the contributors favor marriage for raising children.</p>
<p>This is a reasonable argument.</p>
<p>But I wonder, as do some of the contributors, what will happen if more and more people opt for cohabitation and our society becomes less marriage-centric? If it turns out that cohabitation is not an indicator of stability is there still an advantage that marriage can claim over cohabitation?</p>
<p>I believe the answer is yes.</p>
<p>A marriage is celebrated with a wedding. A wedding is a ceremony full of old rituals and traditions. A wedding takes something greater than the union and binds the couple. A religious marriage ceremony includes a member of the clergy and God Almighty. Even a secular marriage includes a judge and &#8220;The Law&#8221;.</p>
<p>It seems to me that invoking a greater power when forming a union of marriage gives the relationship a greater sense of purpose; something that makes the union holy or consecrated. I believe that is good for a relationship and even better for rearing a family.</p>
<p>Life is full of challenges. Placing a greater purpose than one&#8217;s personal needs into a relationship and a family can be a wonderful glue during difficult times. Anytime one begins to feel lost, knowing that there is a greater purpose to the most important things in one&#8217;s life, a spouse, children, family can be the greatest comfort in the darkest of times.</p>
<p>Marriage indicates that the relationship has something &#8220;more&#8221;. A wedding symbolizes this &#8220;more&#8221;. This &#8220;more&#8221; is priceless. It is also built into a marriage. Cohabitation can have it too. But getting married guarantees it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/51K-wRKh+WL._SS500_.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4546" title="51K-wRKh+WL._SS500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/51K-wRKh+WL._SS500_-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>In his latest column, David Brooks digs deep into his Jewish heritage and procures a word to describe his recent safari excursion.</p>
<p>There were two camps in the safari. One was luxurious and the other, not-so-much. The less luxurious camp was friendlier, more familial and generally more enjoyable despite the inferior conditions.</p>
<p>Brooks needs a word to describe the simpler camp. He settles on a Yiddish word: Haimish.</p>
<p>His definition of haimish:</p>
<p><em>It’s a Yiddish word that suggests warmth, domesticity and unpretentious conviviality.</em></p>
<p>Maybe that is what it used to mean, but in contemporary orthodox Jewish culture, haimish, usually spelled heimish or heimishe is anything but &#8220;unpretentious&#8221;.<span id="more-4545"></span></p>
<p>Today, heimish connotes an almost elitism of Jews from certain ethnic stock and their cherished social conventions. Certain foods (obviously more desirable) are heimish. Certain families (obviously the ones who are preferable matches) are heimish. Certain shuls (not synagogues) are heimish. In every case, heimish has become an upper crust value.</p>
<p>Not &#8220;unpretentious&#8221;.</p>
<p>Certainly, heimish people are friendly, warm and domestic. Perhaps more than those who are not heimish. But the heimish I know would put a chandelier in their tent deep in the African safari. It wouldn&#8217;t be the word used to describe a simpler, less luxurious tent.</p>
<p>The truth is, Brooks&#8217; point is a good one. There is a line. Some places are more about &#8220;who&#8221; and others are more about &#8220;what&#8221;. Sometimes noise and crowds is better than elegance and privacy. Sometimes apartment buildings foster better more meaningful communities than suburban homes. I agree.</p>
<p>We should care more about experiences and less about things. Things only matter when we have important people in our lives with whom to share them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/eye.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4542" title="eye" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/eye-300x236.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a>In a criminal trial, several kinds of evidence are provided by the prosecution to prove the defendant is guilty. The most influential of these forms of evidence is often an eyewitness identification. A case with a positive ID is almost always going to result in a conviction.</p>
<p>The most common cause for an erroneous conviction of an innocent person is eyewitness misidentification. For years, experts have been explaining that misidentification can occur by mistake and with good faith. That doesn&#8217;t make them reliable. It just makes misidentifications into honest mistakes.</p>
<p>In many states legislation has been proposed to curb the effects of eyewitness identification. In New Jersey, the Supreme Court has spoken from the bench in an effort to fix this problem.<span id="more-4541"></span></p>
<p>When an eyewitness identification may be unreliable, the judge in the case is required to hold a hearing to determine the witness&#8217; reliability and then must instruct the jurors how much weight to place on the identification. In most cases the evidence will be heard, but the judge will educate jurors on the reliability of eyewitness identification.</p>
<p>Social science and decades of research have shown that eyewitness identifications are very often unreliable. Factors such as fear, bias, unfamiliarity with the defendant, focusing on the weapon, police misconduct, length of time between the crime and the ID all play into the reliability of the identification. Time and time again, identifications have been shown to be erroneous and have contributed to the death of innocent defendants via the death penalty and decades of prison time for other innocent defendants.</p>
<p>The New Jersey case comes ahead of a highly anticipated United States Supreme Court case next year that will decide an eyewitness identification issue. It is likely that the Supreme Court will follow the model set forth by the New Jersey Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The NY Times has been busy with a story about Ralph Branca and his heritage.</p>
<p>Who is Ralph Branca? He&#8217;s the guy who gave up the &#8220;shot heard &#8217;round the word&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the &#8220;shot heard &#8217;round the world&#8221;? The home run hit by Bobby Thompson of the New York Giants that was immediately followed by &#8220;THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT!&#8221;</p>
<p>Branca has a largely ignominious place in sports lore because he gave up that epic home run.</p>
<p>During an investigative report on his life by reporter Joshua Prager, it was discovered that Branca&#8217;s mother was a Jew who emigrated to the United States in 1901 from what was then Hungary. Branca was as shocked as anyone to learn that his mother was a Jew. Perhaps he was even more shocked to discover that <em>he</em> was a Jew as well. For in Jewish law, if one&#8217;s mother is Jewish, one is Jewish!</p>
<p>Branca was raised Catholic.</p>
<p>As a kid, Branca was a &#8220;Shabbos goy&#8221;, a term I despise for its less than glamorous connotations. He performed certain tasks forbidden for Jews on the Sabbath. (In all likelihood, it was equally impermissible for those Jews to ask young Ralphie to perform those tasks on their behalf, but I digress.) Branca is quoted at the end of the story in the Times as saying that he better remain a Catholic, otherwise he would have been liable for all his &#8220;helpfulness&#8221;. To save his soul, Branca, now 85, says he must remain Catholic.</p>
<p>His faulty logic notwithstanding, Branca is a Jew.<span id="more-4512"></span></p>
<p>At least according to Jewish law he is a Jew.</p>
<p>Alan Dershowitz is of a different mind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Ralph Branca is not a Jew,” said Alan Dershowitz, a Brooklyn-born Dodgers fan, lawyer and Harvard professor. “Whatever the definition, it doesn’t include someone who willingly accepted a different religion. He didn’t stay home on Yom Kippur like Koufax.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Koufax altered strength and guile and knew that you pitch for six days and you rest on the seventh,” he said. “Branca was straight-on; you could see there was nothing Jewish about Ralph Branca.”</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear if Dershowitz made these comments before the revelation that Branca&#8217;s mother was Jewish. If it was before, the big reveal then I am not sure what the Times is using this quote for. It is was after the revelation that Branca&#8217;s mother was a Jew I am completely at lost at how someone&#8217;s non-choice, Branca was raised Catholic or someone pitching style can be the determining factor as to one&#8217;s Jewishness. What in the world is Dershowitz saying?</p>
<p>According to Jewish law Branca is a Jew. Whether he knew it or cared for or not, he is a Jew. In this respect, Judaism is a family. A long lost cousin who did not know he was related to you can&#8217;t be excluded from the family because he has a different style than the rest of the family (if that is even a reasonable assertion, which it is not).</p>
<p>I am disappointed in Dershowitz and I welcome Ralph Branca to the tribe. Even if he was always part of it and even if he doesn&#8217;t want to be&#8230;</p>
