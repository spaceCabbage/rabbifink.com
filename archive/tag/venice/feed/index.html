				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last six years, I have met a lot of very interesting people who have come to visit the Shul on the Beach. People from dozens of countries, backgrounds, and disciplines have joined us for services at Pacific Jewish Center. One of the joys of my pulpit is meeting many fascinating people.</p>
<p>This week trumped them all.</p>
<p>A nearly blind elderly man, escorted by a 20something young man ambled his way through the entrance to the shul. As per usual, he was greeted warmly by shul members. The elderly man declined a siddur explaining that he couldn’t see anyway.<span id="more-8745"></span></p>
<p>I happened to be near the entrance of the shul at that moment. I make rounds through the shul several times during the service.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/25/one-of-those-moments/sur-harvey-william_052314_539_332_c1/" rel="attachment wp-att-8746"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8746" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sur-harvey-william_052314_539_332_c1.jpg?w=980" alt="sur-harvey-william_052314_539_332_c1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> This was during the blessing for the sick after the 5th Aliya, so I overhead the man say <em>“Is the rabbi here, Rabbi Eliyahu Fink?”</em> The man who greeting him responded in the affirmative and then noticing me, told the man <em>“and here he is!”</em></p>
<p>I shook the man’s hand, and the man grasped my hand tightly with both of his warm, comforting hands. Looks me in the eye, despite his inability to see me, and says <em>“I came to see you. We are family.”</em></p>
<p>Never seeing this man before and never hearing of any family in Los Angeles, I was a little confused. He must have sensed my hesitation because he said<em> “I’ll tell you later.”</em> Turns out, “later” was immediately because he couldn’t resist telling me the whole story.</p>
<p>My father’s father’s mother’s mother was named Malka. She had a brother named Ahron Yaakov. The man standing in front of me in the back of my shul was Ahron Yaakov’s son. Woah. I was talking to my great-grandmother’s first cousin. My first cousin, three times removed. The nice young man escorting him was his grandson. My father’s third cousin. My third cousin, once removed. Woah.</p>
<p>The pair took seats near the front and sat quietly for the rest of the service.</p>
<p>Before I began my sermon, I welcomed all our guest, as I always do.  I added a special welcome to Mr. William Harvey (Hershkowitz), my great-grandmother’s first cousin. It was emotional for me just to say the words out loud. To converse with a piece of my history and reconnect with family for the first time.</p>
<p>After services, Harvey was the life of the party at kiddush. Everyone wanted to talk to him and he gave the people what they wanted. Turns out, he is Holocaust survivor who lectures on the Holocaust and other important topics at the Museum of Tolerance. William’s mother was living in the United States in the 1880s but returned to Czechoslovakia in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The Holocaust hit the Hershowitz family when William was 19 years old. Clearly he survived. William story of survival is remarkable and he was showing off a print out of an article chronicling his story published in the Jewish Journal a few months ago. (<a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/survivor/article/survivor_william_harvey" target="_blank">Jewish Journal</a>)</p>
<p>At kiddush, I asked William if we would stick around so we could talk. He said, I waited years to meet you, I can wait a few more minutes. After the crowd had thinned, we finally had some time to catch up on family connections and history. William had maintained a relationship with my great-grandmother, my grandfather (her son) and my grandmother (his wife). He was thrilled to meet me and my sons on this day.</p>
<p>We pledged to meet for coffee and grow our relationship and friendship. I look forward to the opportunity. William is a kind, warm, sweet man. Time spent in his presence is time well spent.</p>
<p>As we parted ways on Shabbos afternoon, William began to cry. I don’t know why he was crying. I started to cry too. I don’t know why I was crying either. But we held each other, our shaking bodies and tear stained cheeks embracing for the first time, feeling like it was the thousandth time.</p>
<p>It was one of those moments. The entire episode had been building to this outpouring of emotion and I will never forget what that felt like.</p>
<p>You meet a lot of great people at The Shul on the Beach. You have a lot of special moments working at The Shul on the Beach. This one topped them all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People often ask me what kind of interesting things and people we encounter at Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach. It&#8217;s impossible to encapsulate life on Venice Boardwalk. This week we were treated to a tripping (completely high) biker who would shout at the top of his lungs as he passed the shul. His ramblings included &#8220;Moses, Jesus, and Gandhi are the same person&#8221; and &#8220;Everything your religion tells you is a lie.&#8221; Everyone inside hears all this as we cover our eyes to recite the Shema. He does four or five fly-bys throughout the morning. This is not wisdom. This is noise pollution.</p>
<p>One of my favorite Venice Boardwalk vagabonds stopped by the shul at around 9 AM this Shabbos. He doesn&#8217;t come into the shul, but he stands outside and quietly and magnificently preaches to me.<span id="more-7748"></span></p>
<p>The fellow is a retired cab driver who emigrated from Iran. He is not Jewish, he used to be Muslim, and now is just a spiritualist. Last time we met he told the entire story of Mohammed from his perspective. It was interesting.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0001.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7749" alt="Venice Boardwalk Shul on the Beach Pacific Jewish Center" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0001.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This Shabbos he stopped by to teach me some of his favorite passages from the great poetry of Rumi. In particular, he was telling me about one poem where Moses is raised above the Pharaohs. This was a compliment to the Jewish people in his eyes. He recites the poetry in verse as he translates it in his mind from the original Persian. It&#8217;s really incredible. Translations of poetry often lose their effect. The ex-cabbie is an artist. He translates on the fly into spectacular English poetry.</p>
<p>He ended by telling me that according to another Muslim poet, Khalil Gibran, the children do not truly belong to their parents. Instead, parents are the vessel through which children flow into the world. They may help them, but they may not harm them or impede their growth.</p>
<p>One evening this fellow was driving his cab through a wealthy neighborhood in Santa Monica. The cab driver picks them up and sees that they are quarreling. They are arguing about their children. One says the other is too soft and the other says too harsh. My friend is listening to the whole thing without saying a word.</p>
<p>At some point, the wife asks the cab driver what he thinks. He is a bit taken aback so he asks her if she really wants his opinion. She confirms.</p>
<p>He starts to wax philosophical and recites the aforementioned poem about children. He gets to a part where the poet says the parents are a great bow, the child is an arrow, and God provides the power by pulling the bowstring. The cab driver turns his mirror so he can see her face and he sees that she is crying. &#8220;Have I said something to upset you?&#8221; he cries out. She shakes her head no as she bursts into a great grin.</p>
<p>She asks if he can pull over for a moment. He pulls over. She steps out of the car and asks him to step out of the car as well. She steps towards the cab driver and embraces him in a hug.</p>
<p>My friend tells me he can still feel the hug all these years later.</p>
<p>He drops them off at their restaurant for dinner. They ask if he can pick them up a couple hours later. They entered the cab at the start of the evening full of anger and division. After dinner they were all smiles and united.</p>
<p>The cab driver becomes the couple&#8217;s private driver for the next ten years.</p>
<p>This is the sort of person one can meet on the Venice Boardwalk standing in front of the Shul on the Beach. I look forward to our next conversation. He doesn&#8217;t have email or a cell phone. I can&#8217;t find him if I want to talk. I never know when he will appear but when he does stop by I know I am in for a treat.</p>
<p>Wisdom and kindness can be found in all shapes, colors, and sizes. Even the haggard ex-cabbie, with cigarette smoke wafting off his clothing mixing with the sweet smell of his pipe tobacco, who is missing a couple of teeth has much to offer. We just have to make space for goodness to enter and for wisdom to be imparted.</p>

It went from Facebook, to the blogs, to the mainstream media and back again. And for good reason. The photo showed a softer side of the NYPD and a human side to homelessness.</p>
<p>As the rabbi at the Shul on the Beach in Venice, I encounter homelessness on a regular basis. There are many heroes and many villains in the homelessness narrative. But seeing the same people day in and day out and then one day never seeing them again, really humanizes the abstract issue of homelessness.</p>
<p>Apparently, the homeless fellow is bootless again. This is a typical homelessness cycle and I think adds an important footnote to the story.</p>
<p>For me, the image of an NYPD officer kneeling down next the homeless fellow in need evoked the feelings of another photo.<span id="more-6568"></span></p>
<p>My great-great-grandfather was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyah_Lopian" target="_blank">R&#8217; Elya Lopian</a>. This saintly man who was a giant Torah scholar who was even more well known for his outstanding character, was captured in this iconic photo. Already an elderly man, R&#8217; Elya was known to leave bowls of milk for the neighborhood stray cats. It is striking to see the concern and compassion of a true <em>gadol. </em>Normally we associate great rabbis with Torah scholarship and intellectual or spiritual prowess. R&#8217; Elya possessed all that, but above this he was a beautiful human being. This photo captures his greatness.</p>
<p>I am proud to carry his name as my own and share this photo with you.</p>

I try very hard to separate the two. This post is a moderate exception.</em></p>
<p>On Friday I moved to Santa Monica CA. I have been the rabbi at The Shul on the Beach in Venice for four years and had been commuting with my family almost every Shabbos and Yom Tov to be at the shul. After four years we decided to make the move and relocate our family from Hancock Park to the beach community. I could not be happier with our decision.</p>
<p>I have been eager to write this post for several years but felt it was disingenuous unless I took my own advice. Now I have, and so here it is&#8230;</p>
<p>The community based around the Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach is mostly made up of residents of Marina del Rey, Venice, and Santa Monica. In my opinion, it is the ideal Jewish community. I believe we have a model worth emulating and a community worth joining. Read on and you&#8217;ll see why I feel this way.</p>
<p><span id="more-6283"></span></p>
<p>On Friday night we sing Shalom Aleichem together after services. Every week we lock arms and sway as we sing the familiar Shabbos tune. I looked around this week and I saw a vibrant but elderly Yemenite Israeli, a Los Angeles native middle-aged baal Teshuva, a traditional 40-something single guy from South Jersey, the academic son of a Conservative Rabbi in his 60s, a young man from Tarzana who usually goes to the Happy Minyan in Pico-Robertson, a young professional who only recently started coming to shul for the first time in his life to say kaddish for his late father, among others. One can&#8217;t help but feel a surge of emotion as the group with its incredibly diverse Jewish backgrounds joined together in welcoming the Shabbos.</p>
<p>On Shabbos morning we had several guests, as usual. One couple was from Lakewood, NJ. They were a typical yeshivish Lakewood couple. Another couple was from Livingston, NJ. They were a borderline modern Orthodox couple. The Lakewood couple said the davening was beautiful and they really enjoyed it. They were surprised how much they liked it and were going to tell their friends to include our shul in their vacation plans. The Livingston couple said that the services and the sermon were perfect for them and they are looking forward to being with us over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Where else in the world can you find such diversity at a minyan? Where else can you find visitors from opposite sides of the orthodox spectrum with the exact same reaction to a shul? Outside the Kotel, there cannot be too many places like that in the world.</p>
<p>This encapsulates our community.</p>
<p>As I am fond of saying, we have ashkenazim and sephardim, Americans, Israelis, South Americans, South Africans, North Africans, Russians, French, Italians, Brits, and Australians, and others who call our shul home. We have baalei teshuva, not-yet baalei teshuva, frum from birth, not frum from birth, or not frum ever, converts, not-yet converts, people who consider themselves orthodox, and people who adamantly do not. We have a little bit of everything. That&#8217;s just the way we like it.</p>
<p>There are places &#8220;out of town&#8221; that can make similar claims. But they are still missing the creature comforts of a large Jewish community like Los Angeles. We are in close proximity to a large variety of schools, several large kosher markets, kosher restaurants, every kind of Torah learning and class, and events for all kinds of Jewish experiences. This is a very unique combination that marries the benefits of out of town life with living in a thriving orthodox community.</p>
<p>Living in a fairly insular orthodox Jewish community can be an unbelievable experience. Many people thrive in that kind of environment. I do not question the wisdom of insular communities. However, I do know that they do not work for everyone. I know this because it doesn&#8217;t really work for me. But know it doesn&#8217;t work for other people because of the emails I get on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Some people feel intimidated in insular communities. Some people feel lost in insular communities. Some people want be in a diverse environment for whatever reason. Some people want a shul where they can meet people from different social circles. Some people want a shul where they can make a difference in the lives of complete strangers. Some people just don&#8217;t fit into the expected molds within the insular communities. Some people would like to have neighbors from different backgrounds and religious beliefs. Some people, whether justified or not, feel like they are constantly under scrutiny or are &#8220;being judged&#8221; in more insular communities.</p>
<p>Those kinds of people are likely to be frustrated by insular orthodox Jewish communities. They might be unhappy. They might feel left out. They might even resent the community and sometimes they resent Judaism by association.</p>
<p>This is very unfortunate.</p>
<p>I know it can seem daunting and maybe even a little crazy, but I have an offer for those people: Try the Pacific Jewish Center community. Our community is the kind of environment where anyone can thrive. Everyone has their own space and there is room for all kinds of people. The core of the community is strong and is welcoming to anyone.</p>
<p>You can be part of a community that makes a huge difference in the lives of many people. Uniquely situated on the Venice Boardwalk &#8211; literally on the beach, thousands of people pass our shul every week. A lot of them stop in and say hi. Some of those people stay for a little while and find a small sliver of inspiration in those moments. Some of them become part of the shul and our community. But even the people who do not have the time or the courage or the interest to poke their head into the shul, are affected by the shul. They see a shul in a very unlikely place and it gives them pause. It causes to think and consider their Judaism, or if they are not Jewish, their religion, or if they are not religious, their personal path. The shul functions on its most basic level as a landmark that says to people that they should stop and contemplate their lives. Some people want to be part of something special like that.</p>
<p>My life goal is to make Torah and Judaism as accessible to as many people as possible. I try to do that on the blog in many ways. One way is to give a voice to those who have legitimate complaints. Another way is to start a conversation about contemporary orthodox Judaism. That is why I do my Daf Yomi and put it online. I want people to be able to learn Torah in short bursts if they don&#8217;t have the time or interest in an hour long class. That is what I do at the shul as well. The programs and services are designed to present Torah and Judaism in an accessible way to the maximum number of people possible.</p>
<p>To underscore this point, there are people who come to our shul that might not go to shul anywhere else. We are proud of that.</p>
<p>I want people out there to know that if you are not in love with your community and shul, you can be. You just need to find the right place for you and your family. For more people than not, the Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach can be that place. If insular communities don&#8217;t work for you, see if you are able to join us for a Shabbos. Try us out. See if you feel the magic of The Shul on the Beach. Most people do.</p>
<p>(Are there reasons not to live here? Yes. There is no eruv, yet. Housing is expensive. It is a bit of a commute to the schools. Some people find the beach-like atmosphere a great spiritual challenge. There are reasons not to join our community. But those reasons do not outweigh the benefits for people who feel like they don&#8217;t fit in where they are currently living. And the beach lifestyle has much to offer. There is a conscious focus on health and wellbeing, people walk, they buy their produce from Farmer&#8217;s Markets, they ride their bikes, it is a more relaxed, less urban lifestyle.)</p>
<p>At the very least, think about it. If you&#8217;ve been feeling out of place in your own home, give us a shot. If you know someone who could use a place where they would feel more at home tell them to check us out.</p>
<p>I hope to see you all at The Shul on the Beach sometime soon&#8230;</p>

(See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/09/03/apples-and-honey-2012-outreach-on-the-beach/">Apples and Honey 2012 | Outreach on the Beach</a>)</p>
<p>One bare chested male was talking loudly as he walked past the shul. I overhead him say &#8220;Only in Venice you have the anti-circumcision guy across the street from the synagogue!&#8221; And then for good measure he looked in my direction and added &#8220;We&#8217;re with you, man!&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can see the apples and honey in the foreground and the Intactivist in the background in the photo above. Click and enlarge the picture to see his &#8220;classy&#8221; setup.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the Intactivist came over to talk.<span id="more-6218"></span></p>
<p>He opened by saying that &#8220;I am not anti-Semitic&#8221;. I told him that I know he is not anti-Semitic, he is just anti-circumcision. We then got to talking for a little while.</p>
<p>The fellow was adamant that any law that they are proposing regarding circumcision would allow for religious exceptions. It was not even a question in his mind. I found that interesting.</p>
<p>I told him that my headline and blog post about the disgraceful Foreskin Man comic book made me a little famous (See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/07/12/abc-news-quoted-me/">ABC News Quoted Me</a>). When I told him my headline &#8211; <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/05/hey-san-francisco-1930s-germany-called-they-want-their-anti-semitic-propaganda-back/">Hey San Francisco, 1930′s Germany Called – They Want Their Anti-Semitic Propaganda Back!</a> &#8211; he laughed his brains out. He totally thought it was hilarious.</p>
<p>Anyway, we had a great talk and he was very nice. He was born a Christian and he primarily objects to default circumcision policies. I asked him about the AAP Study and he got a little upset. In his opinion, the study was disingenuous because it said that &#8220;we cannot recommend circumcision: but yet it did try to convince you (in his words) that circumcision was a good idea.</p>
<p>I told him about my article on the report where I didn&#8217;t think the report was very useful for pro-circumcision people because most of the primary benefits were for people with multiple partners and in third world countries and orthodox Jews (generally) do not engage in pre-marital relations. He thought that was admirable and agreed that the study was not as helpful as some people claimed.</p>
<p>This is the kind of encounter that happens all the time on Venice Boardwalk. It&#8217;s really quite remarkable. People of all different creeds, faiths, and backgrounds have a place on the boardwalk. Although it seems incongruous, it really is the perfect place for a shul.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;ll come visit us sometime.</p>

As usual, I met some very interesting and wonderful people through the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Many people stopped by to dip the apple in the honey which is not as easy as it looks with the nice ocean breeze wreaking havoc with honey drips. Some stepped into the shul for a few moments and we had some lovely conversations. Everyone got free apples and honey and an open invitation to join us at the Shul on the Beach for High Holidays services.</p>
<p>Of all the people that stopped by, three were of particular interest.<span id="more-6213"></span></p>
<p>One guy was an Iranian Muslim. He said his father was very religious and used to pray his morning services for three hours. It only takes a few minutes for most people, but his father was so pious that it took him hours. Then he told me the entire story of Muhammad. He said his father had great respect for Jewish people and used to study the Torah. This fellow is not Muslim. He claims he is &#8220;everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then there was the film student from Boston. She recently came to LA as part of a program with Boston University. Earlier that day her mother was guilting her about where she was going to go to hear the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah. So she told her mom she didn&#8217;t know yet, but she was definitely going to services &#8220;on the beach&#8221;. She had never even heard of shul but when she saw the shul she said it was &#8220;<em>beshert</em>&#8220;! Now she is planning on joining us for services. Her mother will be happy.</p>
<p>My third encounter was with an Intactvist across the way. He gets his own post. Tune in tomorrow for my conversation with the Venice Boardwalk Intactivist.</p>
<p>The High Holidays are a magical time everywhere. But at The Shul on the Beach they are particularly inspiring. Jews from every walk of life, with every level of observance, and of every background join together for services. Everyone is welcome and everyone is made to feel welcome. We invite you to join us.</p>
<p><strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> is September 16 at sundown through nightfall on September 18. Shofar blowing at The Shul on the Beach will be around 11 AM on September 17 and 18.</p>
<p><strong>Yom Kippur</strong> is September 25 at sundown for K0l Nidre through nightfall on September 26.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to join us for services whether for the entire thing or just a few moments. If you want a seat with your name on it, call or email the PJC office at info@pjcenter.com.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Once again, Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach found itself on network television as the backdrop for a scene in NCIS Los Angeles. I have no idea what is happening here or what the show is about, but it certainly looks exciting. Not sure if they knocked on the door for a minyan either.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shabbos services are definitely exciting, but usually the cops don&#8217;t show up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to everyone who told me about this.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Several people who watch the Fox Television show New Girl let me know that our shul was in the frame for a few seconds. Very cool. Here is your proof!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Venice Beach was the key prop in a scene where one character (Jess) tries to help another character (Schmidt) relax. There is no where in the world to find more relaxed people than Venice Beach. It&#8217;s a great place to let go of your troubles. Although, the drum circle people who are dancing in the show bear little resemblance to the actual drum circle people. Clearly, casting preferred to portray them as a group of  people with above average looks who don&#8217;t need a shower. This is not entirely accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you need a Shabbos of relaxation come to see us on Venice Beach.</p>

<p>A beautiful cross-section of Jews from around the world enjoyed the lovely musical intonations of Ron Grun. Pacific Jewish Center members showed up to the concert in strong numbers. But the non-members who joined us for the event made the concert even more special.</p>
<p>On another typical Venice Beach Sunday, dozens of folks popped their heads into the shul. Some stayed for the entire concert. Others made stayed briefly.</p>
<p>But everyone enjoyed. Once again, we were proud to spread the light of Torah and Judaism to the Venice Boardwalk community.</p>
<p>It was wonderful meeting all the people who stopped in for some of the concert and I hope we see you again soon.</p>
<p>OUR NEXT EVENT will be an art gallery over Labor Day weekend. Admission will be free.</p>
<p>We hope to see you then.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Goldstein family for sponsoring the Klezmer Concert again.</p>

Yesterday we hosted a Klezmer concert on the Beach and it was a smashing success!</p>
<p>Dr. Ellie Goldstein&#8217;s close friend has been playing for Dr. Goldstein and his friends at Dr. Goldstein&#8217;s home for many years. Ron Grun (along with Ken Husbands) are very talented klezmer musicians and close friends of Dr. Goldstein.</p>
<p>Over the last year, PJC has been privileged to have Dr. Goldstein and his friends join our shul. One of the many perks of their involvement was the concert taking place in the shul.<span id="more-2773"></span></p>
<p>About 60-70 people attended the concert and many others stopped by for a quick listen and carried on their way along the boardwalk. We are so appreciative that Dr. Goldstein shared the concert with us and the entire beach community.</p>
<p>The concert was great. I confess to not being a Konnoisseur of Klezmer and I was very impressed. The music was great wonderful and the explanations that our performers provided were very interesting. I am so glad that so many folks were able to join us and stop by to get a taste of our shul and the friendliness of our community.</p>
<p>We look forward to more events like this in the future.</p>
<p>If case you missed it, here is a sample of the concert. (And next time be there!)</p>

It was Purim and they wanted to take pictures, talk with me and some of our Shul members and join in our Purim Celebration.</p>
<p>Never ones to turn down inviting strangers into the Shul, we welcomed them.</p>
<p>As I wrote at the time, our Purim Celebration was really special as we welcomed anyone and everyone off the boardwalk into our Shul. Read more here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/">Pacific Jewish Center Purim Celebration Recap February 28, 2010</a></p>
<p>Nancy took beautiful candid photos and David kind of blended in with the rest of us<span id="more-2382"></span> talking to us and learning about the Pacific Jewish Center and the festival of Purim.</p>
<p>Purim is a funny time to be introduced to new people. Things are a little different on Purim. But David managed to get to know us in a way that I never thought an outsider could.</p>
<p>Nancy and David produced a wonderful photo-film of their visit. It is part of their Escape Into America Series. The series is incredible. They have managed to find a lot of soul throughout their travels and it really comes through in their work.</p>
<p>In the photo-film about us, they did a really super job cutting through it all and finding the soul of our shul.</p>
<p>There are a couple things in the photo-film that are not perfectly precise, but that&#8217;s okay. (2 minor corrections: 1- I did mention to David that Purim costumes were likely borrowed for the Venice Carnival in the 15th Century and yet costumes fit in well with the themes of the day, 2- I am not sure I actually said that the Shul was in danger of disappearing &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t, rather, it could have been on that path).</p>
<p>Other than a couple minor mistakes the photo-film really captures the essence of Purim in our Shul as well as much of the essence of who we are at Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>The video stars everyone, but Yosef Beithalachmi (aka Mr. Pickles) and Ashi Bersin are featured in the voice-over. Great job!</p>

We are the custodians of the Shul on the Beach and any chance we have to share the Shul with the public we should!</p>
<p>This year we have had public events on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-photos/" target="_blank">Chanukah</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/15/mishloach-manos-packing-on-the-beach-21410/" target="_blank">Pre-Purim</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/" target="_blank">Purim</a>. We also had several Sundays where we just hang out at the shul welcoming visitors.</p>
<p>Because Sunday was also an Erev Yom Tov (and people are making preparations for the holiday) we did not have a public event for Pesach (stay tuned &#8217;til Sukkos). But I felt it would be wrong not to open the shul doors for at least a little while so I went to the Shul for a couple hours on Sunday.<span id="more-2334"></span></p>
<p>My sister in law came over with Rami and Ozzie and kept and I on them while I gave out Matza and talked to anyone interested in hanging out for a few minutes. I met some very interesting people and took just a few photos which you can enjoy below.</p>
<p>It was a great compliment to a holiday that featured a lot of outreach as some community members hosted Seders for friends and neighbors. One seder had 58! guests and another had well over 30, while others hosted a smaller more intimate groups! I was very impressed with the commitment of those community members to sharing our wonderful traditions with those who may not be so familiar with Pesach and the seder. All I can say is <em>Thank You</em> and <em>Great Job</em>!</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that I took some time to meet and greet people at the Shul on the Beach. We look forward to more events open to the public and more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

We are the custodians of the Shul on the Beach and any chance we have to share the Shul with the public we should!</p>
<p>This year we have had public events on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-photos/" target="_blank">Chanukah</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/15/mishloach-manos-packing-on-the-beach-21410/" target="_blank">Pre-Purim</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/" target="_blank">Purim</a>. We also had several Sundays where we just hang out at the shul welcoming visitors.</p>
<p>Because Sunday was also an Erev Yom Tov (and people are making preparations for the holiday) we did not have a public event for Pesach (stay tuned &#8217;til Sukkos). But I felt it would be wrong not to open the shul doors for at least a little while so I went to the Shul for a couple hours on Sunday.<span id="more-3044"></span></p>
<p>My sister in law came over with Rami and Ozzie and kept and I on them while I gave out Matza and talked to anyone interested in hanging out for a few minutes. I met some very interesting people and took just a few photos which you can enjoy below.</p>
<p>It was a great compliment to a holiday that featured a lot of outreach as some community members hosted Seders for friends and neighbors. One seder had 58! guests and another had well over 30, while others hosted a smaller more intimate groups! I was very impressed with the commitment of those community members to sharing our wonderful traditions with those who may not be so familiar with Pesach and the seder. All I can say is <em>Thank You</em> and <em>Great Job</em>!</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that I took some time to meet and greet people at the Shul on the Beach. We look forward to more events open to the public and more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

<p>This Purim, The Shul On The Beach opened its doors to the entire Venice / Santa Monica community to join in a Purim Celebration. An excellent turnout from our members, friends and neighbors set the stage for a truly memorable afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Beithalachmi prepared a wonderful Purim feast that was partially sponsored by Yossi and Joannie Ziff on the occasion of their second anniversary. As always, Jeff Liss planned an excellent party, including first class entertainment (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/28/alula-performs-at-pacific-jewish-center-purim-party-in-venice/" target="_blank">see the previous post</a>), refreshments and a costume contest. Most importantly, our community really stepped up to the plate in terms of hospitality, friendliness and warmth. Led, once again, by Rabbi Mintz, many, many guests were ushered into the Shul.<span id="more-2185"></span></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting neighbors who had simply never dropped by the Shul, Israelis on vacation, random folks on Venice Boardwalk who wanted to stop in, children, elderly people, Jews, non-Jews, religious and otherwise. We tried to take photos with as many people as possible and you can check out the slideshow of photos below. [If you have any photos to add, PLEASE email them to me and I will add them!]
<p>Guests enjoyed hamentaschen, the lively music and touring our Shul. As always, we enjoyed meeting so many people from so many different backgrounds and situations and sharing the joy of Purim with them.</p>
<p>There was a small contingency from the press (MSNBC.com) that joined us throughout Purim. They were at the reading of the Scroll of Esther on Purim evening and returned for the today&#8217;s celebration. It was so much fun getting to know them and sharing our Purim with them. We look forward to seeing the fruits of their labor sometime in April. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
<p>The gathering was lively and inspiring. I spoke briefly about the meaning of our commandment to remember Amalek. Amalek attacked the Jewish people just after the Exodus from Egypt. They focused their attack on the stragglers. I expressed my hope that as a community we would not allow any stragglers. We must be inclusive and help everyone to feel that they are in the center of the group. There can be no fringe group if we are to &#8220;defeat&#8221; Amalek. Today&#8217;s event was a strong step in that direction.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to all of you who helped and joined and made the event the festive celebration it was.</p>
<p>We are planning more events of this nature in the future.</p>

<p><a href="http://frumsatire.net" target="_blank">Heshy Fried aka Frum Satire</a> performed in front of a very diverse crowd of ~60 at the Pacific Jewish Center at the Shul on the Beach on Sunday February 14 2010 and it was incredible.</p>
<p>Heshy ranted for over an hour and the audience was captivated. He could have gone on for another hour and had everyone laughing all the way through.</p>
<p>I introduced Heshy and the show with an important message.<span id="more-2155"></span> Judaism, in many ways has become more about idiosyncrasies and self-defining labels than substance, lately. Sometimes we need a keen satirist to remind us that most of that stuff is just silliness. We need to remember what the important things are and when Heshy cuts through &#8220;all the other stuff&#8221; with his wit and comedic genius, what remains is what is real.</p>
<p>So, I concluded, that is why I read Frum Satire and that is why I am honored to introduce all of you to the stylings of Frum Satire.</p>
<p>Heshy touched on so many great topics. Crazy shidduch resumes, messing with BTs, not looking yeshivish, kiddush techniques and many more hilarious anecdotes and observations were satired. The crowd loved it all. Laughing for an hour can hurt your face. I found that out after the show.</p>
<p>Heshy&#8217;s humor is clean and still manages to be very funny. Kudos!</p>
<p>Those who came to the show were so happy they did. Those who missed the show missed out on some great fun. We also met a bunch of new people to our shul who had never been inside before. It was a pleasure to meet you all!</p>
<p>I want to thank Heshy for making the Shul on the Beach his first West Coast show. We had a great time over Shabbos and the Sunday evening show. Come back and visit soon!</p>
<p>I edited a 7 minute portion of the show (just a few minutes from the beginning of the show) for your viewing pleasure. (I had no tripod and the camera was my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SER47Y?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001SER47Y">Canon PowerShot SD 780 IS</a> so please excuse the shakes.)

<p>As the Shul on the Beach, a community institution, we are charged with the responsibility and opportunity to bring Judaism to the boardwalk. Our Chanukah party, the first in a series of events and programs designed to reach that end was incredible.</p>
<p>Thank yous are in order to Jeff Liss for organizing, planning and executing the whole thing. Thank you so much. Many others contributed as well and for that we express our appreciation to you as well.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing how many people came through our doors today,<span id="more-1866"></span>but it was a very large number. Rabbi Mintz was particularly effective at luring passers by into the shul. Thank you so much! The shul was packed with community members as well as many passers-by ranging from observant friends to completely unaffiliated Jews as well as many curious non-Jews.</p>
<p>I had the fortune of meeting some wonderful people. Like the father of an adorable daughter whose expectant wife was home. He thought a Chanukah Party would be the perfect way for this non-Jewish father to celebrate with his Jewish daughter. He noted, that as soon as possible, he will be bringing his wife and, God-willing, twin daughters, when mom and babies are up and about. He cited the generosity and friendliness of the community members as impressive.</p>
<p>I met people from all over Los Angeles. Locals, from Santa Monica and Venice. From all over Los Angeles from as far as the Valley to Marina del Rey. I met visitors from Chicago, New Jersey, Miami, Israel and the UK. It was truly a universal Chanukah celebration.</p>
<p>Once inside everyone was treated to warm hospitality, friendliness and traditional Chanukah foods. (Of course there was food.) Towards the end of the party I spoke to the remaining crowd and the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-address/" target="_blank">audio has been posted here</a>.</p>
<p>Our very talented Office Manager, Leslie Friedman took a lot of great photos. You can see them in a slideshow below. If you spot yourself leave us a comment and say hi!</p>

I hang out on the Venice Boardwalk hoping to meet anyone interested in our shul or Judaism. I show interested passers-by the shul, sometimes we take a picture, (I tell them about the blog), I invite them to &#8216;something&#8217;, we shmooze and then they are on their way.</p>
<p>This Sunday was the last Sunday before our upcoming Chanukah party so it was a prime opportunity to publicize the party which is open to the public.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <span id="more-1800"></span>the weather was not cooperative. It was cold by Los Angeles standards and the boardwalk was much quieter than usual. Very few people stopped in to say hi on this day.</p>
<p>But one encounter was just so remarkable that I wished to share it with you.</p>
<p>A pair of women were walking and as they passed the shul one of them veered in our direction and asked if she could come inside. She said the magical words that we hear all too ofter &#8220;I pass by the shul all the time, but it was never open&#8221;. &#8220;We&#8217;re working on that&#8221;, I respond with a smile.</p>
<p>One of the women is Jewish, mostly reform, but has been affiliated with Orthodox as well.</p>
<p>After a few pleasantries, I reveal that I am the Rabbi. I introduce myself as Eliyahu Fink. She asks if I am related to any other Rabbi Finks. I reply in the affirmative. My father is <a href="http://finkorswim.com/category/rabbi-aaron-fink/" target="_blank">Rabbi Fink</a>. My <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/rabbi-berel-fink/" target="_blank">grandfather</a> was Rabbi Fink as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your father Rabbi Aaron Fink?&#8221;, she asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes he is! Do you know him? And how?&#8221;</p>
<p>She tells me that she used to live in Buffalo NY where my father was Headmaster of the <a href="http://www.kadimah.org/index.php" target="_blank">Jewish Day School</a> for 4 years. She remembered me as a 6 year old boy and remembers my parents well. In fact she recently saw them at a wedding of a Buffalonian a couple years ago.</p>
<p>What a small world!</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will see her again at the Chanukah Party.</p>

It is called <a href="http://www.kcet.org/local/departures/la_river/" target="_blank">Departures</a> and it focuses on the people and places that make the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. For the last six weeks they have been working on Venice. Today they came to the Pacific Jewish Center Shul on the Beach to learn about us and to be included in their upcoming Venice piece.</p>
<p>It was a true honor and privilege to be a part of this worthwhile project. The production should be finished in February and I look forward to seeing that.</p>
<p>The camera crew shot some footage of our morning services and did two interviews.<span id="more-1649"></span> First, they interview Gary Dalin. Gary has been part of PJC since 1979 and provided great insight into the rich history of Pacific Jewish Center and the greater Venice Jewish community. He was eloquent and impressive in his interview and represented us very well. Great job Gary!</p>
<p>I was interviewed next. I hope I did okay. I myself have interviewed so many Jewish College student on camera and made those interviews into documentaries, so I know how hard it can be. (For two of my videos click <a href="http://werejustbetter.com/JAM/jam06.wmv">here for JAM 2006</a> and <a href="http://werejustbetter.com/JAM/Chase.mov" target="_blank">click here for Chase Edler</a>.) Among many topics, we talked about the juxtaposition of the historic quality of the Shul on the Beach to the future of outreach including this blog and my relative youth as a Rabbi. We also talked about the role the Shul plays in the boardwalk community, surrounded by the wild atmosphere of the boardwalk. It wasn&#8217;t too long, maybe a 35 minute interview in total, but we covered a lot of topics. Of course, there were some delinquents that felt the need to disturb us, that is just life on Venice Boardwalk&#8230;</p>
<p>I hope the final product reflects well on our special community and those who see it are inspired at least to check us out some time. I ended the interview with an open invitation to anyone who would like to see what we are all about and I extend that invitation to all of you reading this right now.</p>
<p>I also, want to thank Justin, Dan and Matt for including us in this project. I wish you much success in this endeavor and anything you do in the future.</p>
<p>Here are a couple pictures that Leslie Friedman took with her BlackBerry during the interview.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prayer is something so basic to all faiths and religions. Jewish ideas of prayer are decidedly different from other cultures. It is very important to learn about the Jewish approach to prayer.</p>
<p>I began the class by announcing that this was a topic I longed to discuss for a very long time. I finally felt that the time was right.</p>
<p>We asked all the basic questions about prayer. We asked some advanced questions about prayer.</p>
<p>Using ideas from Rabbi Chaim Volozhin and others we pieced together a rational approach to prayer that made sense to us.</p>
<p>It was a very exciting class with outstanding participation and a very alert listening audience.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Prayer is something so basic to all faiths and religions. Jewish ideas of prayer are decidedly different from other cultures. It is very important to learn about the Jewish approach to prayer.

I began the class by announcing that this was a topic I longed to discuss for a very long time. I finally felt that the time was right.

We asked all the basic questions about prayer. We asked some advanced questions about prayer.

Using ideas from Rabbi Chaim Volozhin and others we pieced together a rational approach to prayer that made sense to us.

It was a very exciting class with outstanding participation and a very alert listening audience.

I really recommend giving this class a listen.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1610" title="Venice Boardwalk" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/imagesGallery_big05.jpg?resize=240%2C164" alt="Venice Boardwalk" data-recalc-dims="1" />When we are in Venice for Shabbos we stay at wonderful, little, extended stay hotel on the boardwalk called <a href="http://www.sucasavenicebeach.com/" target="_blank">Su Casa</a>. They try and give us an Ocean View Room. It is great to have the ocean view, but not as much for the ocean view as for the &#8220;boardwalk&#8221; view.</p>
<p>You see, Venice Boardwalk is like Mardi Gras every weekend. (See picture to the left.) Street performers, vendors and drunkards line the boardwalk and thousands and thousands of tourists and natives walk back forth as they hawk their wares.</p>
<p>Rami loves the people watching and I must admit, it can be quite addictive!<span id="more-1609"></span></p>
<p>Today we saw, by far, the most ambitious sales pitch on the boardwalk. We were sitting down to lunch with the windows ajar and we heard the following declaration from the boardwalk.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Get your sand here! The very best California sand, just 50 cents! Hand picked sand here! Why walk 5 more feet to the beach when you can get your own handful of sand right here for 50 cents!&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So we went to the window to check it out. It was two teenage boys with a lot of spare time and a great sense of humor. They were just being funny, but they actually kept it up for a few hours. They tried to sell sand to every one who passed them by. Some people gave them a few tips and I think they ended up with a couple dollars.</p>
<p>But it got me thinking. How often are we looking for something and we are willing to make an effort to get it, yet it is right there in front of us. Imagine someone actually bought the sand they were selling. They could just walk 5 feet and get it for free!</p>
<p>I think that sometimes people are looking for things in exotic places and very often what they are looking for is right in front of them. Certainly happiness is this way. People travel to the far corners of the earth in search of happiness. But happiness is right there in front of them. Happiness is a choice.</p>
<p>Love is the same way. People look so hard to find love. But we can always love. Everyone we know can benefit from our love. Our families yearn for our love and to love us back. Again, it is right here in front of us.</p>
<p>Even business opportunities can be the same way. We look and look, but very often, our best opportunities are the ones we already have.</p>
<p>We would never buy sand on the Venice Boardwalk. Let&#8217;s always look at what we have before we look for what we think we do not have&#8230;</p>

<p>What was short on time was long on content. The end of the Seventh Chapter of Mesillas Yesharim contains what I find to be the most profound insight in the entire text.</p>
<p>We all are familiar with the common idea that if &#8220;one doesn&#8217;t feel &#8216;it'&#8221; we don&#8217;t feel comfortable acting that in way. We even call people who act in a way not consonant with their feelings hypocrites. The Ramchal has a completely different perspective and I strongly recommend listening to today&#8217;s class.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was not easy giving my Monday night class tonight. After fasting all day to remember the tragic death of the great Gedaliah I found myself tripping over my words. So I apologize if the class sounds a bit jumbled.</p>

Highlights today included a very interesting insight from Maimonides regarding laziness and the &quot;Golden Path&quot;. My father told me that in the Shmona Prakim, Maimonides gives a very surprising opposite to laziness.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding the perfect blog URL is an adventure. The choices are endless and one&#8217;s mood can affect one&#8217;s opinion tremendously, leading to potential buyer&#8217;s remorse.</p>
<p>As I talked on the phone with my blog consultant, Judd Magilnick, we searched for the perfect concept. Our ideas ranged from the ultra bland, finkblog.com to the ultra creative ifinkican.com. We were having a hard time agreeing and my family was nixing just about every suggestion.<span id="more-927"></span></p>
<p>Eventually, finkorswim.com was suggested. Of course, there were some detractors at first, but as we realized the deeper connotations of finkorswim.com its appropriateness became apparent.</p>
<p>A play on words from &#8220;Sink or Swim&#8221;, finkorswim.com reminds us that if we don&#8217;t swim, we will sink. In fact the Talmud teaches us that a father is obligated to teach his child to swim. This is a lesson in parenting. A father must provide his child with the tools necessary to navigate through life. Further, a teacher is compared to a father in Judaism and students are compared to children.</p>
<p>A Rabbi is a teacher. It is my job, as the Rabbi of the Pacific Jewish Center in Venice, to help provide the tools necessary to &#8220;swim&#8221; in the sea of life. When I speak at Pacific Jewish Center or when I teach a class at PJC I try to provide some of those tools that we can learn from Torah to help our lives. Many of those classes are available here on the blog.</p>
<p>Another way I try to do my job of helping folks swim through the sea of life is by providing perspective on social issues, news items, ethical dilemmas and anything else that floats through my mind. Reading my thoughts on various subjects and reading the thoughts of other readers can also provide tools for swimming through life. Many of those thoughts and ramblings can also be found on this blog.</p>
<p>Another idea that finkorswim.com represents is a direct invitation to all. When you got to the beach you have a choice. You can go a swim or surf, or sunbathe or walk the boardwalk. But other times, you can also &#8220;fink&#8221; and come into the magical walls of the Pacific Jewish Center and study the ancient wisdom of the Torah. One can learn, socialize and grow tremendously as a person in our quaint Shul. There is a special feeling inside the Shul that I know you will feel once you come inside.</p>
<p>So, next time you are on Venice Beach, don&#8217;t forget, you can &#8220;fink&#8221; or &#8216;&#8221;swim&#8221;, or you can do both!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/anonymous-vs-onymous-blogging.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear</em></strong></a><strong><em>. &#8211; more discussion there.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networks" target="_blank">Social Networking</a> has been around for a long time. The term is nearly two centuries old and the concept perhaps 30 times that.</p>
<p>With the internet explosion around the new millennium social networking became all the rage on the world wide web. MySpace and others blazed the trail. Now, blogging, <a href="http://facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> are an integral part of our social landscape.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was drawn to these new age ways of using technology to create social networks. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve been on Facebook </a>since its inception five years ago and <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">joined Twitter</a> a while ago and have only recently begun to blog.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks some incredible things have happened that are direct results of social networking online.<span id="more-806"></span></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago a lovely woman came to our Shul on the Beach for Shabbos morning services. At the Kiddush (where incredibly, we do not have Kugel) she approached me and introduced herself as &#8220;Rena, I follow you on Twitter&#8221;. Immediately I realized it was <a href="http://twitter.com/tinsbar" target="_blank">@Tinsbar</a> from Baltimore. Rena was in LA for a few days and decided to come check out <a href="http://pjcenter.com/" target="_blank">our Shul.</a> Rena enjoyed her time spent at PJC and we enjoyed her company. In fact one community member even got some footwear recommendations from Rena!</p>
<div>When I related this story to a Shul Board Member, he said this is the new wave of Shuls. We have moved from being just a &#8220;Brick and Morter&#8221; Shul to a &#8220;<em>Click</em> and Mortar&#8221; Shul.</p>
<div>About a month ago <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/05/another-ethical-question.html" target="_blank">I posted the story of a penniless Jewish artist on the beach</a> who was homeless. He needed some money and I was not sure if he was a good candidate for Tzedaka and I posted my moral dilemma on <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">DovBear</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/e-finks-tzedaka-case.html" target="_blank">As reported last week</a>, an anonymous donor (living miles away from Los Angeles) who read the blog post here on DovBear, literally saved this man from a dire situation.</p>
<p>On Twitter I follow a wonderful couple from Connecticut. She is a blogging convert and is now in the process of a more stringent conversion that would be universally accepted. He is a fellow blogger as well who blogs about his relationship with his Judaism.</p>
<p>He recently discovered the wonderful Jewish town of Waterbury CT. With a Yeshiva, Day School, Shul, Mikva, Kosher restaurant and very affordable housing, Waterbury is quickly picking up young couples looking to settle (slightly) out of town. I read all about that on his &#8220;<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/onymous" target="_blank">onymous</a>&#8221; (it&#8217;s a new word that means &#8216;the opposite of anonymous&#8217;) blog.</p>
<p>My sister and brother in law live in Waterbury, I told him to call my brother in law and check out Waterbury. They set a date and spent a wonderful afternoon together.</p>
<p>In short all of this great stuff occurred as a direct result of blogging, Twitter and social-networking 2009 style. These events also occurred in many ways as a result of &#8220;onymous&#8221; blogging. The charity case required someone be known (in this case, me). There is no way Rena would have found me if I blogged and Twittered anonymously. And if I was an anonymous blogger I never would have connected my sister with two fellow Jews looking for friends and connections.</p>
<p>These are the benefits of &#8220;onymous&#8221; blogging.</p>
<p>On the other hand (term of art &#8211; remember that discussion?), anonymous blogging and Twittering is also great. In particular I point to DovBear&#8217;s blog as a bastion of anonymity and great discussion that would admittedly never happen if we all had faces, names and families. The unfortunate realities of the Frum world as they are, almost force us cower in fear when we disagree with authority or tradition and we tend to hide behind familiar rituals, thus avoiding conflict and we are safe behind the veil of secrecy that is anonymous blogging.</p>
<p>Anonymity gives the silent, a voice. It gives us all a chance to be heard.</p>
<p>In truth, we have other things to worry about as well. As <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/dovbear/7834534744960396147/#512532" target="_blank">Tikkun Olam pointed out</a>, we have Frum leaders blanketing all bloggers as a negative force, when we know that is ridiculous. There are some negative forces and many positive forces in the J-Blogosphere.</p>
<p>Worse is the fear we all feel of expressing our opinions. My opinion on this is transparent as I blog &#8220;onymously&#8221;. Speak your mind, challenge what you don&#8217;t understand but never lose the art of respectful questioning. I am (usually) not afraid to speak my mind and challenge what I don&#8217;t understand and thus I don&#8217;t need to be anonymous. Plus, I support many of the traditional ideals that &#8220;they&#8221; espouse. But, the crux of the issue remains the environment which we have created and now support that does not allow for us to challenge.</p>
<p>I say created, and that is self evident. I say support because we &#8220;give in&#8221; to the cyber bullies that force us to remain anonymous. How much greater impact would have as a group if those whom we challenge knew that we were real people? They should know that we have Yeshiva educations, wonderful families and jobs and we are frustrated with the status quo. But to &#8220;them&#8221; we are words on a computer screen, not people.</p>
<p>Words are cheap. Words have no soul when they are anonymous. If we want to be heard we need to be people. People have souls and people need to be dealt with. It is easy to ignore anonymous bloggers. People with souls demand attention and can affect change.</p>
<p>Should we strive to create a Frum culture that allows for challenging and questioning?</p>
<p>Are we helping the situation by blogging anonymously?</p>
<p>Do we lose a lot by blogging anonymously?</p>
<p>Do we stand to lose more by &#8220;onymous&#8221; blogging?</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday was the launch of a new initiative at Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>First, some matters of introduction.</p>
<p>We are blessed with an incredible location for our Shul.</p>
<p>Our Shul is on the Venice Beach Boardwalk. With thousands of tourists and locals walking along the boardwalk every week, it is a great spot to meet and greet Jewish people from all over the world.</p>
<p>The Shul is on such a perfect spot for meeting new people it would almost be criminal <em>not</em> to be there on Sundays!</p>
<p>This Sunday<span id="more-772"></span> we began our &#8220;Outreach on the Beach&#8221; initiative. I was there for most of the afternoon and we had a chance to meet many interesting folks from Los Angeles and around the world.</p>
<p>I met an Iranian Jewish couple. We spoke for a little while and they confirmed what <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/10/where-is-the-outrage-the-plight-of-middle-eastern-jewry/" target="_blank">I wrote about last week related to the treatment of Mid-Eastern Jews outside of Israel</a>.</p>
<p>I also met a South African Jew whose son had his Bar Mitzva at our Shul 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Then I met a Hollywood stunt man who wants his son to have his Bar Mitzva and maybe even in our Shul.</p>
<p>Later I met a wonderful woman whose son lives in Venice and is a very well known attorney.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the afternoon I met two friends who were originally from Holland. One now lives in Los Angeles and the other is still living just outside Amsterdam.</p>
<p>This was just a sample of some of the great people we met and I have included some photos that we took at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun and I hope that over the summer we will meet many more Jewish people from around the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/17/malcolm-gladwell-and-perfection/" target="_blank">have had</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/01/genius-the-modern-view-and-the-torah-view/" target="_blank">my critiques</a> of David Brooks from the NY Times.</p>
<p><a href="http://theconversation.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/guns-gays-and-abortion/" target="_blank">But today,  I think he got it right</a>. Really right. Like, 100% right.</p>
<p>He was asked about the &#8220;Big Three&#8221;. No, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_automobile_manufacturers" target="_blank">GM, Ford, Chrysler</a>. No, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_%28universities%29" target="_blank">Harvard, Yale, Princeton</a>. Not, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_leaders_of_World_War_I" target="_blank">Clemenceau, Wilson, George </a>either.</p>
<p>The new Big Three is Guns, Gays and Abortion.<span id="more-738"></span></p>
<p>Brooks was asked his opinion of why the trend in the country is towards Gay rights, the trend is to ignore Gun rights and the trend is against Abortion after the first trimester. In the &#8220;asker&#8217;s&#8221; opinion, there seems to be tension pulling these issues from opposite sides. One is trending &#8220;left&#8221;, one is trending &#8220;right&#8221;, and one is not trending at all.</p>
<p>What she really wants to know is why isn&#8217;t the left or right winning on all these issues? How come they are trending in three different directions.</p>
<p>Brooks answers very profoundly and eloquently. His basic premise is that Americans seek to <em>maintain the social fabric of their existence</em>.</p>
<p>Most Americans have gay friends, co-workers, relatives, neighbors etc. and therefore it preserves the social fabric of the American&#8217;s existence to provide rights for their gay acquaintances.</p>
<p>Guns is a rural vs. urban issue so it depends on where you live that you seek to preserve your social environment. Thus, there is little movement on this issue.</p>
<p>Finally, on abortion, he proclaims most Americans are torn by the issue. We are uncomfortable imposing any opinion on our fellow Americans because it is such a sensitive issue. Thus, most people fall in the middle and trend slightly to the left or the right but are not vocal about it. Therefore, change is not likely on the abortion issue.</p>
<p>Wow. Brooks really did a great job explaining how our country works. Really, he has explained how humans work. How our world works. We care about our social environments and we try to preserve them.</p>
<p>Truthfully, humans are social beings. This is what really separates man from beast. We interact in a more complex way than any other being in our world.</p>
<p>We consider any hominid existence prior to the establishment of a social environment such as cities as prehistoric. History begins when we begin to socialize our existence.</p>
<p>We continue socializing in our lives to this very day.</p>
<p>When we meet new people we are socializing.</p>
<p>When we have guests join us for a meal we are socializing.</p>
<p>When we use social networking tools like <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/eliyahufink" target="_blank">Facebook </a>and <a href="http://rabbifink.wordpress.com" target="_blank">blogs</a> we are socializing.</p>
<p>I believe that the synagogue is a social place. Certainly, our <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Shul on the Beach</a> is a social place. Yes, we worship in shul, but that could technically be done solo.</p>
<p>We are mandated by Halacha to create and foster houses of worship and to attend them as a group to appeal to the social needs of man.</p>
<p>So come join us!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/24/boy-can-i-relate-to-this/" target="_blank">I blogged about my bond of kinship</a> with a pastor in Ocean City Maryland.</p>
<p>We both are clergy working on beaches with fickle crowds. Sometimes we are packed and sometimes we are not&#8230;</p>
<p>The post generated a bit of a response from some of our Community Members as well as some other blog readers. We had one commenter wonder if anyone reads this blog. (Yes, a lot of people do read this blog.)</p>
<p>We had another commenter offer to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=youngstown+PA&amp;daddr=505+Ocean+Front+Walk,+Venice,+CA+90291&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=%3BFf2xBgIdAijw-A&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=w&amp;sll=37.14831,-98.925965&amp;sspn=37.650893,65.390625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.09024,-98.964844&amp;spn=37.683309,65.390625&amp;z=4" target="_blank">walk from Youngstown PA</a>. (It takes 33 days by foot according to Google, click if you need directions.)</p>
<p>So, how did our Shavuos go?</p>
<p><span id="more-725"></span></p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>Shavuos began with a very nicely attended Erev Shavuos Mincha. The rule is that we count 49 complete days from the second day of Pesach until Shavuos. Therefore we need to wait until nightfall is certain to commence Shavuos Services.</p>
<p>To pass the time we studied the Book of Ruth. I gave an in depth overview of the story as well as some of the deeper insights into why we study the Book of Ruth on Shavuos.</p>
<p>The overall theme that I wished to convey was that the Jewish line of Kings comes from David, who comes from Ruth, who was a convert. Further, the Jewish Messiah will be from the Davidic line as well. This is a powerful take-home lesson.</p>
<p>We followed evening services with a tasty community meal. Then the action began.</p>
<p>Together, we studied a section of Talmud in depth. The topic was &#8220;Expression of Ownership&#8221; and the marathon 2 hour session &#8220;flew by&#8221;. I was peppered by great questions and all <strong><em>40</em></strong> attendees participated and enjoyed the learning.</p>
<p>The next morning we reconvened for morning services and were blessed with a robust Minyan. I spoke about the &#8220;Chosen People&#8221; and mentioned the <a href="https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/jewish-genius-10855?page=all" target="_blank">famous Charles Murray essay in <em>Commentary Magazine</em> about that topic</a>. We were treated to a special dairy kiddush on the back patio. Mmmm cheesecake.</p>
<p>Friday night services were very well attended. We had a few guests in our shul, as is very common at PJC. One couple had been guests at one of our community member&#8217;s homes on Pesach for a Seder and they came to PJC for the first time for Friday night services. Of course, they were invited to a family for Friday night dinner and I heard that it went really well.</p>
<p>Another guest was a student of mine from a previous position I held at a different job. It was really cool that he came to our shul for services and we had a chance to catch up. He is now at Tufts in Boston and was part of their <a href="http://www.meor.org/meoroncampus/campuses/tufts.asp" target="_blank">Maimonodies Scholars (MEOR) program with Rabbi Loketch</a>, who grew up across the street from my wife in Monsey NY. (Small world.)</p>
<p>We had a guest speaker as well. Community member Erez Talmor spoke about what the Shema means to him. I introduced him by reminding the congregation that Torah study is not just for Rabbis and being a Torah scholar is something we all strive for. Erez is a great example of this and he did a great job.</p>
<p>Shabbos morning services were elongated due to several key additions. The congregation stuck it out and we concluded with a satisfying kiddush on the back patio.</p>
<p>Even Shabbos afternoon services were well attended. This is a trouble spot from time to time, but we had a wonderful minyan. Following services we had a small dinner. We were supposed to talk about the number 50 and why Shavuos has no set date in the Torah. Instead we had yet another discussion about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/clothes/" target="_blank">clothes and dress codes</a>. Riveting, as always.</p>
<p>Shavuos was a resounding success in Venice. The classes and services were well attended. We had our usual influx of strolling Jews who wandered into the shul off the boardwalk and the spiritual and physical warmth of our shul provided a wonderful Shavuos for everyone.</p>
<p>I guess I do not have so much <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/24/boy-can-i-relate-to-this/" target="_blank">in common with the Pastor in Ocean City MD</a> after all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was browsing the Washington Post online edition when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/24/AR2009052402868.html?hpid=artslot" target="_blank">a column caught my eye</a>.</p>
<p>It is about churches in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/24/AR2009052402868.html?hpid=artslot" target="_blank">Ocean City Maryland</a>.</p>
<p>Why is a rabbi reading about Churches in Maryland?</p>
<p>What does the column have to do with a rabbi of the <a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/" target="_blank">Shul on the Beach</a> in <a href="http://www.venicebeach.com/" target="_blank">Venice California?</a></p>
<p>It turns out&#8230; a lot.<span id="more-707"></span></p>
<p>The Church is on the beach and that invites casual wear. The attire is not what one would normally expect at a house of worship. Certainly not, &#8220;Sunday Finest&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/clothes/" target="_blank">I can relate to that.</a></p>
<p>On Memorial Day weekend it is hard to fill up the Church. Forty seats are set up and when services are scheduled to begin they are all empty.</p>
<p>Boy, can I relate to that.</p>
<p>During vacation months, attendance picks ups.</p>
<p>I can relate to that as well.</p>
<p>It turns out that our Shul on the beach has some of the same issues as the Church in Ocean City Maryland.</p>
<p>At our Shul, some weeks we are packed. There are no extra seats. The Kiddush (refreshments and snacks) is well attended. Invitations for Shabbos meals are a dime a dozen.</p>
<p>Other weeks, especially when the weather is poor, or even if the weather is threatening to be poor, attendance is sparse. Thankfully we have had a Minyan for every Shabbos since I have been the Rabbi.</p>
<p>From what I hear, Shavuos will be a test. The first day of services will be at 9:00 AM on Friday morning. I have a feeling that we will not have as robust a crowd as usual.</p>
<p>If you are in Santa Monica or Venice this coming weekend, please join us at the Shul on the Beach. Services begin at 9:00 AM, I speak following the services and then you are invited and treated to a Kiddush, outside on the back patio.</p>
<p>It will be worth your while &#8211; I guarantee it.</p>
<p>I can relate to that pastor in Ocean City, but I don&#8217;t want to need to&#8230;</p>

<p>Last week we began to learn about the detriment of scoffing or sarcasm to out spiritual growth. The general principle is that one who is incapable of seriousness about life will not be able grow spiritually. This week I had planned on completing Chapter 5 in its entirety.</p>
<p>However, we got no further in the text of Mesillas Yesharim this week.</p>
<p>Instead we had a truly invigorating discussion ab0ut &#8220;seriousness&#8221;. It is tough for us to relate to this section Mesilas Yesharim. We are allowed to make jokes, frivoility is not ALWAYS bad, so how can we bring this section down to earth and make is relevant?</p>
<p>One example that I cited for a moment as we began class was the way observant Jews typically dress. Have you ever wondered why observant Jews dress conservatively for the most part or wear &#8220;black and white&#8221;?</p>
<p>Much of what we talk about was related to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">this post</a>, as well as these <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/13/clothes-in-the-nba/" target="_blank">posts</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">this post</a> as well.</p>

<p>Today we sought to resolve the burning question we began our series with. Why is Talmud study the focus of Torah scholarship? Why do Yeshiva students spend the bulk of their time studying Talmud? Why is Talmud our connection to the Oral Law transmission?</p>

<p>The last two weeks (catch up <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/03/mesillas-yesharim-050309/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/12/mesillas-yesharim-051009/" target="_blank">here</a>) have focused on setting aside time for Torah and spiritual growth. This is to avoid becoming mired in materiality and neglected our spiritual needs.</p>
<p>Today we moved on to the next detriment. The next thing Ramchal teaches us to avoid is an overarching lack of seriousness. Perhaps it could be more precisely defined as immaturity.</p>
<p>Ramchal says that being un able to take things seriously and scoffing anything important is going to impede our growth.</p>

<p>We had a great turnout this week despite the fact that we lost some attendees to Lag B&#8217;Omer celebrations this week.</p>
<p>This week <a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank">Connections</a> was the second of a series of classes about the history, philosophy, structure and benefits to Torah study.</p>
<p>In preparation for Shavuos, when the Jewish people accepted the Torah, this was the perfect time for the series.</p>
<p>Tonight we did a quick review of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/05/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-connections-5409/" target="_blank">last week</a>, though <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/05/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-connections-5409/" target="_blank">listening online</a> would be a better option. You will get the full picture that way.</p>
<p>Our journey this week took us from the writing of the <a href="http://www.torah.org/learning/basics/primer/torah/mishna.html" target="_blank">Mishna</a> through the the beginnings of the formation of the Talmud.</p>
<p>There was a great discussion about &#8220;machlokes&#8221; and the differing opinions among <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=59&amp;letter=T" target="_blank">Tanaic and Amoraic</a> literature.</p>

We had a great turnout this week despite the fact that we lost some attendees to Lag B&#039;Omer celebrations this week.

This week &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Connections&lt;/a&gt; was the second of a series of classes about the history, philosophy, structure and benefits to Torah study.

In preparation for Shavuos, when the Jewish people accepted the Torah, this was the perfect time for the series.

Tonight we did a quick review of &lt;a href=&quot;http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/05/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-connections-5409/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=&quot;http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/05/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-connections-5409/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;listening online&lt;/a&gt; would be a better option. You will get the full picture that way.

Our journey this week took us from the writing of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torah.org/learning/basics/primer/torah/mishna.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mishna&lt;/a&gt; through the the beginnings of the formation of the Talmud.

There was a great discussion about &quot;machlokes&quot; and the differing opinions among &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=59&amp;letter=T&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tanaic and Amoraic&lt;/a&gt; literature.

To be continued next week. See you there (or here).
