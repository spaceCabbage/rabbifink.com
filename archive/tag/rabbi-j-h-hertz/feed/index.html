				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rabbi Louis Jacobs was an orthodox rabbi in the early 20th century. He was orthodox until he wasn&#8217;t. Professor Alan Brill chronicles the demise of Jacobs and how he diverged from prior orthodox positions and adopted liberal positions that were reserved for the non-orthodox.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate for orthodox Judaism that Jacobs and his contributions were lost to orthodox Judaism. I think we would be better off today had Jacobs toed the line and stayed within the bounds of orthodoxy. He was a great thinker and we nearly had the benefit of his thinking in orthodox Judaism.<span id="more-7368"></span></p>
<p>In short, Jacobs accepted elements of Biblical Criticism to the extent that his view could not be reconciled with any version of orthodox Judaism. According to Brill, Jacobs believed that much of the text of the Bible was not dictated to Moses. He believed that the origins of Judaism were not relevant rather the evolved Judaism of the 20th century was key. Eventually he went so far as to say that the Bible was written by humans.<img class="size-full wp-image-7369 alignright" alt="09jacobs_190" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/09jacobs_190.jpg" width="190" height="257" /></p>
<p>This placed him firmly outside the camp of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>But the real tragedy is what Brill says at the end of his post. Before Jacobs, orthodox Judaism had been developing an acceptable version of dealing with Biblical Criticism. Rabbis like Rabbi J.H. Hertz and Rabbi Isidore Epstein had previously acknowledged that while there was a revelation at Sinai, some parts of the Torah either predated Sinai and were including by incorporation or that some edits may have been made after Sinai. Their  views allowed some human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>The view of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein are significant. Both were orthodox rabbis and nevertheless were able to assert that there was a human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>However, Brill asserts that after Jacobs was ousted from orthodox Judaism for his newfound heretical views, the previously acceptable opinions of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were given the pink slip as well. The approach to Biblical Criticism that developed in the wake of the Jacobs fiasco was so rigid that the somewhat flexible views of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>I think this is unfortunate. Orthodox Jews are expected to believe in the most rigid form of Torah M&#8217;Sinai. It is more rigid that the accepted beliefs of great orthodox rabbis from all across the timeline of Jewish history. Is it all because of Jacobs? Maybe. It certainly fits historically.</p>
<p>So while it is a shame that we lost Jacobs, in essence we have also lost Rabbis Hertz and Epstein. This is an even greater tragedy. They were orthodox and now their views are widely considered unorthodox.</p>
<p>But would it not be helpful to 2013 Judaism to allow their opinions back into the fold? I think it would. Absolute Torah M&#8217;Sinai can be a greater challenge than believing in God or in the power of Chazal to create obligation to contemporary orthodox Jews. Perhaps having a more flexible version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai that is consistent with historical orthodox Judaism would be of great use to frum skeptics everywhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Noahs-ark.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6339" title="Noah's ark" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Noahs-ark-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a>This week we read Parshas Noach. The focus of the parsha is the flood story. Most people are vaguely familiar with this story as it is told in the Bible.</p>
<p>God is disappointed in man, God decides to destroy mankind, God saves Noah by having Noah build a giant boat, Noah saves the animals in the boat, the rains come, the springs open up, the flood rages for 40 days and 40 nights, eventually the waters subside, Noah and his children settle back on dry land.</p>
<p>Moderns have three main issues with the flood narrative in the Bible. The first issue is the historicity of the event. The second issue is the confluence of deluge stories in other cultures, particular the Epic of Gilgamesh from the ancient Babylonians. The third issue is whether there are two flood narratives or just one.</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews rarely deal with these issues. The preferred method of handling these questions is to make a general statement about how the questions are flawed and then to change the subject.</p>
<p>However, the great Rabbi J.H. Hertz deals with these issues in his excellent Chumash. Everyone should have a copy. (Buy one here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0900689218/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0900689218&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">Amazon</a>). Although he only speaks briefly and somewhat superficially on the subject, the fact that he makes the effort to discuss these issues is very admirable and unique. I don&#8217;t believe he sufficiently tackles the issues and puts them to rest, but I do think it is laudable that he tries. This post will deal with his approach to the first two questions and an apparent bombshell therein. Inquiring minds can research his approach to the third question on their own.<span id="more-6338"></span></p>
<p>R&#8217; Hertz assumes that there was a flood. This is not solely based on the Biblical narrative, as he also mentions the support of the science of his day in dating the flood to 3800 BCE. Today, science can show that there was no worldwide flood in 3800 BCE, but there is much evidence for <em>a flood </em>at <em>some prehistoric time</em>. This explains why almost every single ancient civilization has a flood story.</p>
<p>The way R&#8217; Hertz frames the comparison of the Bible&#8217;s flood story and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh" target="_blank">Epic of Gilgamesh</a> is very fascinating. He says the our forefather Jacob studied the ancient traditions of man in the Study halls of Shem and Ever. One of the things they studied was the ancient memory of a terrifying flood that caused &#8220;<em>a complete breach in the continuity of civilization in the primitive dwelling-place of mankind</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, R&#8217; Hertz compares it to the Babylonian tale. The similarities are uncanny. A great flood is doomed to destroy mankind, man and beast are saved in a boat, there is dove and then a raven sent to determine if the waters have subsided, and after leaving the ship the saved people bring sacrfices. He notes that the Biblical tale is far more hopeful and imparts an important moral lesson that the basis of humanity is justice and righteousness whereas the Babylonian tale is unethical, devoid of any morality. Specifically, Noah was saved because of his righteousness. The people were being punished for their evil sins. In contrast, the Babylonian tale tells the story of quarreling Gods who deceive one another and mankind. It is a story without moral value. Its primary purpose is to put fear in the hearts of the people. As much as the stories are similar, the differences tell the real story.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Hertz concludes with this incredibly difficult tightrope act:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In its Babylonian form, Assyriologists tell us, the story seems to have been reduced to writing as early as the days of Abraham. It must have been known in substance to the children of Israel in Cannaan and later in Egypt. But in the form in which, under God&#8217;s Providence, the Patriarchs transmitted it to the their descendants, it was free of degrading elements, and became an assertion of the everlasting righteousness of One God.</em></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t be certain, but this sounds to me like a borderline controversial statement. It sounds like he is saying that the Torah incorporates legends that were part of Jacob&#8217;s family lore in a specific way and in turn they become Torah. In other words, the story of flood need not be taken as a literal narrative that was told to Moses by God in a vacuum. Rather, the Jewish people knew this story, it carried a valuable lesson, and God incorporated it into the Torah.</p>
<p>I think this is a remarkable assertion and certainly outside the mainstream view in orthodox Judaism today. I guess my question is if is <em>should be </em>outside the mainstream orthodox view? I don&#8217;t think so. Currently, the modus operandi for handling delicate questions such as these is to retreat to the fundamentalist, maximalist position. It is going to become harder and harder to maintain those views. Perhaps the methodology used by R&#8217; Hertz is worth a  second glance.</p>
<p><em>(Thank you to Steg Belsky and Jacqueline Nichols for sending me images of the essays in the Hertz Chumash. Having recently moved, my copy seems to have gone missing, or been confiscated by the thought police).</em></p>

<p><em>Crossposted to Dovbear here: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2012/02/adventures-in-code-of-hammurabi.html" target="_blank">Adventures in the Code of Hammurabi</a></em></p>
<p>As a general rule, orthodox Jewish rabbis and teachers pretend that Bible Criticism does not exist. This is not necessarily a conscious choice, rather it was a choice made on their behalf over a century ago. The ugly result of this decision is that when the orthodox Jew encounters BibCrit he is left without any tools or foreknowledge to handle the issues and in a sense one can be blindsided by basic observations made in BibCrit. This, in turn, can take a disastrous toll on one&#8217;s beliefs in Torah and God.</p>
<p>One of the few exceptions to this rule in Rabbi J.H. Hertz. In his Chumash, R&#8217; Hertz has several essays that, at least on a basic level, deal with some of the challenges raised by BibCrit. Some of the BibCrit he cites is outdated and some of his approach is also outdated. But it is still worth understanding and appreciating his efforts.</p>
<p>One major BibCrit challenge surrounds this week&#8217;s parsha, Mishpatim. In the Parsha, the Jewish people are taught the basic outline of their Civil Code. The parsha discusses property, chattel, damages, loans, and other seemingly non-religious laws. The issue is that there is an earlier code that precedes this Mosaic code of Parshas Mishpatim, The Code of Hammurabi.</p>
<p>The Code of Hammurabi was written in the days of Abraham by King Hammurabi. Some scholars identify him as King Amraphel from the Bible. Hammurabi&#8217;s code is preserved by a stele and tablet in its complete and original form. There are 282 laws that govern civil law for followers of Hammurabi. Many of these laws are either the same or very similar to the Mosaic laws, many others are significantly different. The challengers hold that the reason these two codes are similar is because Moses (or some other later figure), when &#8220;writing&#8221; his code simply borrowed from The Code of Hammurabi and adjusted a few items before pasting it into the Torah. Clearly, this does away with the Divine Author of the Torah.</p>
<p><span id="more-5150"></span></p>
<p>R&#8217; Hertz, as he is wont to do, flips the script. He shows that the more we know about The Code of Hammurabi, the more we can appreciate the Torah&#8217;s laws in Mishpatim. The areas that our codes differ shed light on the beauty and majesty of Torah. For example, biggest difference between the two codes is the use of the death penalty. In The Code of Hammurabi the death penalty is administered for a multitude of offenses including property offenses. The Torah uses it much more sparingly and never for property crimes. Another example is with regard to class. The Code of Hammurabi differentiates between theft from a king, noble, commoner and slave. The Torah does not create such classes. One general area of law that is ignored by Hammurabi and is a focal point of the Torah is how to treat the poor and needy with consideration and assistance. These examples show that the Torah is spiritually elevated above The Code of Hammurabi and this speaks to a Divine Author.</p>
<p>One of the more perplexing verses in Mishpatim is Exodus 21:31. The Torah tells us that a &#8220;goring ox&#8221; kills someone, the owner is put to death. <em>&#8220;Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.&#8221;</em> Why would it concern us whether or not the ox gored a son or a daughter? If the ox killed, the owner is killed! R&#8217; Hertz quotes Prof. David Mueller who explains that in The Code of Hammurabi it states (#229 &#8211; #230):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;If a builder has built a house for a man, and has not made his work sound, and the house he built has fallen, and caused the death of its owner, that builder shall be put to death.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If it is the owner&#8217;s son that is killed, the builder&#8217;s son shall be put to death.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The Torah abhors this kind of law. Instead of killing the son or daughter of the owner of the ox, the owner of ox, the man responsible for the death is killed. R&#8217; Hertz adds that this theme is repeated in Deutoronomy 24:16:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In R&#8217; Hertz&#8217;s view, showing the humanity added to the law by the Torah when compared to The Code of Hammurabi, we can better appreciate the morality of our law.</p>
<p>Most significantly, The Code of Hammurabi actually punctures a hole in a common theory of BibCrit. That is, the Torah was written by Ezra or some contemporary of Ezra before the Second Temple period. It is highly unlikely that a human author would use such an old code if he were writing for his Second Temple period audience. Rather, it suggests that the Torah is indeed of an older vintage and closer in time to Abraham and Hammurabi. This fits in well with the Revelation at Sinai and the idea proposed by some Rishonim that the Torah, by word of God, included old scrolls of law that went back to the time of our forefathers.</p>
<p>Further, and R&#8217; Hertz does not say this, if the Jewish people present at the revelation were familiar with The Code of Hammurabi it would make sense to use language and structure with which they were familiar.</p>
<p>One final point. The Code of Hammurabi is perhaps most useful for understanding many passages in the Torah, specifically in Genesis. R&#8217; Hertz mentions Abraham taking Hagar as a concubine as one example. I think he is referring to The Code of Hammurabi #140:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;If a man has married a votary, and she has not granted him children, and he is determined to marry a concubine, that man shall marry the concubine, and bring her into his house, but the concubine shall not place herself on an equality with the votary.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Thus, Abraham was justified in taking Hagar as a wife, but once she thought she was an equal he was justified in sending her out.</p>
<p>(Another example cited by R&#8217; Hertz is the dispute between Yaakov and Laban. In The Code of Hammurabi #261-267 the code states the rules for paying a herdsman. I am not certain what R&#8217; Hertz is using this reference for.)</p>
<p>Our friend Josh Waxman on his <a href="http://parshablog.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Parshablog</a> has several other examples sprinkled throughout his blog. One is the explanation of why Reuben lost his birthright simply because he ascended to his father&#8217;s bed. The code says in #158: &#8220;If any one be surprised after his father with his chief wife, who has borne children, he shall be driven out of his father&#8217;s house.&#8221; So when Jacob discovered Reuben on his bed, ie surprised, he was driven out of the house, ie the inheritance.</p>
<p>There are more examples. but the point is clear. The Code of Hammurabi can be a useful tool for teaching Chumash and appreciating the Torah. We don&#8217;t need to be afraid of it.</p>

<p>One of my favorite topics and themes in Judaism is understanding the structure and methodology of the Talmud. I am constantly looking for more sources and studying, adapting and adjusting my understanding of the issues. Until I read the post on Kavvanah I did not know about the introduction to the Talmud written by Rabbi J.H. Hertz. I read it and I loved it.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest you read the entire introduction. It is written beautifully and with such an inspiring view of the Talmud that it becomes required reading.</p>
<p>Some highlights:<span id="more-5051"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Like nearly every one of the rabbis, he earned his bread by manual labour.</em></p>
<p>Speaking about the rabbis of the Talmud, R&#8217; Hertz reminds us that the rabbis of the Talmud worked for a living. They studied when they were able. He wrote this before the standardization of kollel. But it is almost prophetically inspired.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Concerning the exact time at which the Mishnah was committed to writing, diversity of opinion has prevailed among eminent Jewish authorities during the last nine centuries.</em></p>
<p>I never knew this. But apparently, R&#8217; Sherira Gaon and Rashi, among others held that the Mishna was not actually written down until the 8th or 9th century. I would love to see a citation for this. Either way, this is astounding to me. I was always taught that R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi codified AND wrote down the mishna. It seems that these authorities held that the Mishna was codified by R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi and was transmitted orally for a few hundred years before it was published in written form. Clearly, Rambam disagrees. Fascinating.</p>
<p>Here is the best part:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Halachah, as we have seen, means ‘the trodden path’, rule of life, religious guidance. To it belong all laws and regulations that bear upon Jewish conduct. These include the ritual, the civil, criminal, and ethical laws.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Everything else is embraced under the term Haggadah; literally, ‘talk’, ‘that which is narrated’, ‘delivered in a discourse’. This again can he subdivided into various groups. We have dogmatical Haggadah, treating of God’s attributes and providence, creation, revelation, Messianic times, and the Hereafter. The historical Haggadah brings traditions and legends concerning the heroes and events in national or universal history, from Adam to Alexander of Macedon, Titus and Hadrian. It is legend pure and simple. Its aim is not so much to give the facts concerning the righteous and unrighteous makers of history. as the moral that may be pointed from the tales that adorn their honour or dishonour.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>That some of the folklore element in the Haggadah, some of the customs depicted or obiter dicta reported. are repugnant to Western taste need not be denied. ‘The greatest fault to be found with those who wrote down such passages. says Schechter, ‘is that they did not observe the wise rule of Dr Johnson who said to Boswell on a certain occasion, “Let us get serious, for there comes a fool”. And the fools unfortunately did come, in the shape of certain Jewish commentators and Christian controversialists, who took as serious things which were only the expression of a momentary impulse. or represented the opinion of sonic isolated individual, or were meant simply as a piece of humorous by-play, calculated to enliven the interest of a languid audience.’</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In spite of the fact that the Haggadah contains parables of infinite beauty and enshrines sayings of eternal worth, it must be remembered that the Haggadah consists of mere individual utterances that possess no general and binding authority.</em></p>
<p>This is a loaded paragraph and one that today is considered highly controversial. R&#8217; Hertz has the broad shoulders necessary to make such a statement and I admire him greatly for making it. What he is saying is that the Talmud has statements that are binding and many that are not. The difference between the two is whether or not they are halachic. Further, it should not be a surprise to anyone if the rabbis of the Talmud were inaccurate in their non-halachic statements. Some were mistakes, others were made for purposes other than for their truth. R&#8217; Hertz charges those who take these non-serious statements with greater seriousness than they were intended as fools. I wouldn&#8217;t be so harsh. But I agree with the sentiment.</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen if a prominent rabbi wrote this today.</p>
<p>And finally another excellent line in conclusion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>My purpose is merely to give a brief presentation of the Talmud as a book. I shall therefore conclude with the words of I. Abrahams. ‘The Talmud,’ he says, ‘is one of the great books of the world. Rabbinism was a sequel to the Bible; and if, like all sequels, it was unequal to its original, it nevertheless shares its greatness. The works of all Jews up to the modern period were the sequel to this sequel. Through them all may be detected the unifying principle that literature in its truest sense includes life itself; that intellect is the handmaid to conscience; and that the best books are those which best teach men how to live. The maxim, Righteousness delivers from death, applies to books as well as to men. A literature whose consistent theme is Righteousness, is immortal.’</em></p>
<p>Through it all, the Talmud is one of the greatest books ever written. It&#8217;s true, the sequel is at least as good as the original. We follow the Talmud in our lives and the Talmud interprets the Torah. It&#8217;s world certainly seems different to the naked eye than the world of the Bible. Says, R&#8217; Hertz, this is a good thing.</p>
<p>Above all, the Talmud is an attempt at righteousness and aids us all in our attempts towards the same.</p>
