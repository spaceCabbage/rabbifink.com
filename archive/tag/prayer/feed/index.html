				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a touching Jewish custom to move one’s permanent seat for prayer during the period of mourning when one says kaddish for a deceased family member. The idea is to remind the mourner that things are different. Nothing is the same in the wake of loss. Changing one’s seat is a visceral reminder that things are not the way they used to be. It is constant mnemonic that the mourner’s life has changed.</p>
<p>But why change the place one prays? I believe the idea is that we pray as a community. That’s the reason we go to synagogue for prayers. There is something special about praying with one’s community. When a person in the community experiences trauma, the person is affected directly, but the community is also indirectly affected. A mourner has changed his place in the community and thus changes his place in communal prayer as well.<span id="more-8555"></span></p>
<p>We are not, God forbid, mourning. But our community has been disrupted. This Shabbat, the presence and prayers of Naftali Fraenkel, Eyal Yifrah, and Gilad Shaar should have been felt in their communities in Israel. But since their kidnapping a week ago, their seats remain empty.</p>
<p>Jewish people pray as a group in synagogues, temples, schools, yeshivot, basements, office buildings, sports arenas, highway rest areas, and anywhere that a minyan can be assembled. Although we pray as separate groups, we also pray as a nation. This is especially true when we are united by a tragedy that we all can feel, and we all know our national prayer is for the missing: Naftali, Gilad, and Eyal.</p>
<p>At my <a href="http://PJCenter.com" target="_blank">synagogue</a>, we will be assigning three chairs in the front of the shul for our kidnapped brothers. These empty chairs will remind us that as a nation we are different than we were just 10 days ago. Three young men are missing from our community and we notice their absence.</p>
<p>It’s a small gesture, but one that shows we join together with students of Mekor Chaim Yeshiva and the boys’ home communities. These three empty chairs will not be filled until Naftali, Gilad, and Eyal take their permanent seats.</p>
<p>Their seats at the Shabbat tables of their parents will also be noticeably unoccupied. Perhaps, in solidarity with their heartbroken parents, we should set an extra seat at our Shabbat table. A subtle reminder that there are three Shabbat tables that are incomplete. Let’s tell the brave parents of these three boys that they are not alone. We stand with them. We give them our hearts for love, our shoulders to cry upon, a hand to help them cope, and an empty seat at our table for their boys.</p>
<p>Solidarity is a powerful thing. When we support others, we strengthen the fiber that connects each and every Jewish person to one another. The stronger our web of interconnectivity becomes, the more it can sustain our brothers and sisters in need. Help build that web. Help strengthen our ties. Let us bear the burden for others. Until our boys are back home, safe and sound, the most important thing we can do is console and comfort each other.</p>
<p>I invite others around the world to join us in a gesture of solidarity. Make a place for Naftali, Gilad, and Eyal in your synagogue or at your Shabbat table.</p>
<p>Sometimes the simplest things can bring strength are solace to those who are suffering. Sometimes a tiny gesture of empathy can make mountains into molehills. Sometimes a sympathetic ear and knowing smile be everything. Sometimes an empty chair can fill a broken and empty heart.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The entire Jewish world is wrought with anxiety and anguish as we worry for our three teenage boys who have been reportedly abducted by sworn enemies of Israel. We cry because we want them to #<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bringbackourboys" target="_blank">bringbackourboys</a>. It hurts. People cope with tragedy in different ways. It’s important to remember that we all feel things in different ways and different emotional places so it’s understandable that we will deal with tragedy in different ways.</p>
<p>One of the most universal responses to distress is prayer. It’s not just the super religious people who pray either. It’s pretty much everyone. The prayers are not all the same. Some might hold candles in silence, others may sit in a corner and quietly recite Psalms. I’ve seen prayer groups that seem more like concerts, and some people gather in large groups and bombard the heavens with their pain induced screams for mercy. It takes all types. But they are all praying.</p>
<p>Two controversial articles in Jewish publications took notice of all this praying for the safety of our three boys.<span id="more-8479"></span> <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.599431" target="_blank">In Haaretz</a>, Professor Samuel Heilman argued that Psalms are not enough of a response. <a href="http://forward.com/articles/200199/prayer-wont-bringbackourboys/" target="_blank">In the Forward</a>, Leah Bieler wondered if prayer was the most effective way to #bringbackourboys. Unfortunately, both articles were sabotaged by attention grabbing headlines that substantially misguided readers about the content of the article.</p>
<p>Both writers were trying to make fine points with laser precision but the headlines put a sledgehammer in their hands instead. Inevitably, people saw the headlines and had already determined that these articles were undermining the value and efficacy of prayer. Fortunately, neither article actually did that and I think there is value in attempting to understand their intended overall message.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8480" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/prayer.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="prayer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The loudest protestations against these articles erupted from the camp of Orthodox Judaism. Many argued that according to Orthodox Jewish beliefs, prayer absolutely can change the outcome of a catastrophe and therefore there is no way to overestimate the power of prayer. Thus is it blasphemous to imply that prayer is not enough or that prayer won&#8217;t bring the boys home. In their view, God is anthropomorphized to an extent and can change a decree based on the prayers of the supplicant. This is a maximalist position. There are other versions of understanding prayer in Orthodox Judaism. Another perspective follows a more Maimonidean approach and holds that prayer changes the supplicant but it cannot change God. The impetus for this position is that God’s perfection precludes God from being influenced by human reasoning or tears of pain. In this view, God is not going to change but we can change. When we change, our Divine fate can change. More importantly, even if our prayer is not answered in the way we hope, we have grown from the experience.</p>
<p>Thus, I think there is a nuance of a difference between the attitude of the Maximalist Prayer and the Maimonidean Prayer. I see the first view as more confident in man’s ability to change outcomes through prayer and that change could even be the primary goal of prayer. I think the latter view is more concerned with the personal growth of the supplicant and if the situation is changed by the act of prayer it’s like a bonus.</p>
<p>This is important because the first view is the view that is more likely to be outraged by the aforementioned articles. If prayer is primarily a tool that can change things then if prayer isn&#8217;t working we just need more prayer. It will work eventually. Prayer ought to work on its own. If it doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s only because our prayer was flawed. the second view is less concerned with the Divine response so the prayer is not expected to yield their desired outcome.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the first view, the two articles may never reconcile with your worldview. They might, but it’s harder. But if you hold the second view, I think the articles are actually pretty good.</p>
<p>The fine point both articles tried to make was that prayer is but one part of our response to a tragedy. It’s not the only response. It’s also not the response that should be given primary credit if we obtain the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Professor Heilman’s article is very practical. Obviously the terrorists are the problem. They are the violent people who are harming our children. But Professor Heilman argues that we have not done enough to protect our children. Yeshiva students are expected to hitchhike in potentially dangerous areas. They are being placed at risk. Then when something bad happens, we turn to the heavens. Prayer is great, but is that the best way to react here? Maybe a policy change or a campaign for safer transportation would be a more appropriate reaction. His point is that prayer and God are often scapegoats for solvable problems.</p>
<p>His model is more like the model of Jacob as he prepared for war with Esau. Jacob prayed. But Jacob also strategized and did everything in his power to find a diplomatic resolution. Prayer is one element of a solution. Practical and earthly ideas are also part of a solution. We need both and we can’t fixate on just one. Especially when it’s the easier one.</p>
<p>Ms. Bieler’s article focuses on how prayer can misattribute blame too. If we pray to God, perhaps it’s because God is at fault for our predicament. We pray so we can change God’s evil plan for us. But this is a primitive view of God, that I don’t actually think accurately describes the way most religious Jews view God, and Ms. Bieler urges the reader to be more sophisticated than that. Thankfully, most of us are. Further, the blame here should not be attributed to God, God forbid, the terrorists and their enablers are the problem here.</p>
<p>More importantly, when the boys are brought home safe and sound, God willing soon, who gets the credit? If you believe in the maximalist version of prayer, it seems obvious that God gets at least a portion of the credit. But if you believe in the more Maimonidean version of prayer who gets the credit? The person praying was never expecting a specific result so it is only reasonable to give all the credit to the soldiers and politicians and activists who brought the victims home. In any case, they definitely get some credit.</p>
<p>It seems that this divide explains the consternation over Ms. Bieler’s article and to a lesser extent, the potential bewilderment over Professor Heilman’s article. They both hold of the second approach to prayer.</p>
<p>Neither of their articles actually say what their headlines imply. They both value prayer and they both encourage prayer. But they are also passionate about doing things the best way we can do them and developing a more nuanced approach to prayer is a worthy endeavor. This is especially true when so many of us have been inspired to pray fervently for the safety of our boys.</p>
<p>I think both of these articles make good points that can absolutely be reconciled with Orthodox Judaism. I think the writers make good arguments for their positions and we should consider their ideas. Leah Bieler’s argument that although we pray to God, we blame the evildoers is not offensive at all. In fact, I think we would all agree. Professor Heilman’s argument that we tend to turn to God and prayer instead of fixing actual problems is something we’ve seen before and is far from ideal.</p>
<p>One more thing. At the very least, prayers are a potentially unifying activity. They signal our concern for others to others. When we know that others are feeling the pain of a tragedy that is hurting us, we can experience a small level of comfort. Stated another way, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/the-lighthouse/.premium-1.599052" target="_blank">prayer is an ancient hashtag</a>.</p>
<p>Let us hope and pray, together, that we can #bringbackourboys using Jacob’s formula. We pray, we prepare for combat and engage in battle, and we use backchannels to come to a peaceful resolution. God willing, we can emulate Jacob’s strategy and merit the same positive result.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check out my latest for Haaretz. I argue that children should pray in the sanctuary with their parents instead off attending youth groups. Here is the lede. I can put the rest on the blog in a couple days. [THE POST IS NOW UPDATED WITH THE FULL TEXT]<span id="more-7772"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2549708928.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7774" alt="2549708928" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2549708928.jpg?resize=360%2C208" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Jewish and Christian communities have long struggled to make religion relevant to youth and teens. One of the ways that both communities have attempted to combat the problem of disaffected youth has been to offer alternate programming for young people.</p>
<p>But a recent survey has shown that this approach is not working.</p>
<p>The National Center for Family Integrated Churches found that the reason Christian youth groups were not successful might be because they fail to inspire participants. An <a href="http://www.charismamag.com/spirit/church-ministry/18920-youth-groups-driving-christian-teens-to-abandon-faith" target="_blank">article on the study</a> in Charisma Magazine argues that taking children away from the parents and the senior religious figures at church may be what is harming the church’s ability to impact the youth. What the article shows is that parents and clergy are the best resources for religious instruction and inspiration. Therefore, outsourcing to junior clergy or third party mentors takes the best resource out of the equation.</p>
<p>There is an established norm at Orthodox synagogues across America to provide youth groups and teen minyan (prayer quorum) services on Shabbat, based on an assumption that these groups are beneficial to the youth and teens in attendance. But if we consider NCFIC’s findings, we understand that this conventional wisdom may actually be inaccurate. Children belong in shul with their parents and shuls must be places that welcome youth.</p>
<p>Youth programming is more prominent in synagogues that are less than ultra-Orthodox. In Haredi shuls the kids stay in shul for the most part. In most Modern Orthodox shuls only the adults pray in the main sanctuary. Childcare is a selling point at many shuls and not just for babies and toddlers, older children are cared for as well.</p>
<p>I think we are making a mistake in segregating our shuls by age. Children should participate in the shul experience. They should see their parents as prayer role models. Shul must become ingrained in their religious psyche. Children must feel welcome in shul. Everyone needs to learn how to pray and participate in the prayers. It can’t feel good to be shooed out of the sanctuary as though one is unwanted or undesired in shul. Every time we send our youth out of shul, we create negative associations in their minds.</p>
<p>Further, the criticism of youth groups and failed attempts to inspire our teens tends to focus on programming. People think that the right person, or with the right amount of money, or with the perfect program everyone will be turned on by their Judaism.</p>
<p>Now it seems there is some evidence that poorly programmed youth groups are not a problem. Perhaps we can extrapolate from the Christian survey that the very existence of youth programming can be a problem.</p>
<p>Some parental duties are non-delegable. We can hire people to teach our children math, how to kick a soccer ball, or even to accumulate Torah knowledge and wisdom. But passion for Judaism and spirituality must come from the home. It comes from mothers and fathers who care about their children and also care about their Judaism. Passion and inspiration cannot be taught. They must be handed off.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that the Torah reiterates that Torah should be taught by parents to their children. “Ask your father and he will tell you” (Deuteronomy 32:7) is not mere advice; it is the way Judaism passes from one generation to the next. Passion and inspiration require deep, long-term, personal relationships, like the relationship between parent and child.</p>
<p>One of the most important places parents can demonstrate this passion and impart it to the next generation is in shul. Let’s not miss out on this opportunity. We only have one chance to raise our children. We can’t afford not to get it right.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa famously said, “The family that prays together stays together.” Part of staying together in Judaism is keeping the Jewish flame alive and burning strong. Praying together is a vital tool in this endeavor and we should seek to maximize these opportunities. Instead of relegating our children to side rooms and shallow programs, and delegating our parenting role to less qualified counselors, we should embrace the few hours we can spend with our children in shul. Let’s pray together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4559" title="images" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images-300x127.jpg?resize=300%2C127" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The orthodox Jewish world is in tumult over the recent essays published by a local Los Angeles rabbi. <strong>Rabbi Yosef Kanefsky</strong> wrote a series of blog posts in varying tones explaining why he is unwilling to say the blessing where men thank God for not making them women. The exact text of the blessing reads: <em>Blessed are You, Lord our G-d, Master of the world, who did not create me a Woman.</em></p>
<p>This blessing comes from the <em>Talmud</em> quoting the <em>Tosefta</em>. It has been part of Jewish liturgy for nearly 2000 years. Any tradition, be it religious or not, that has that kind of cachet cannot be discarded willy nilly.</p>
<p>Indeed, Rabbi Kanefsky justified his position by articulating something that many have felt when reciting or hearing this blessing: <em>by its plain meaning, and by the simple smell test, it has the effect today of justifying our lack of progress, and of affirming for us that women do not possess the spiritual dignity than men do.</em></p>
<p>There has been a very strong response from more traditionalist orthodox rabbis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/" target="_blank">One blog</a> has dedicated no less than four of its 28 blog posts in August to distancing itself from Rabbi Kanefsky and either by association, implication or explicitly tossed Rabbi Kanefsky out of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>There is much to say on this topic and much has already been said. My purpose in this blog post will be to deal with two separate issues. They could just as easily have their own independent blog posts. But I prefer one landing place for both of these issues.</p>
<p>The first issue relates to the actual blessing in question.</p>
<p>The second issue relates to the response from the traditionalists.<span id="more-4550"></span></p>
<h2><strong>The Blessing</strong></h2>
<p>It was 11 years ago that Senator Joe Lieberman famously said on Imus in the Morning that he does not say this blessing. My less than 20 year old brain was met with the tension between tradition and modernity. I decided then that it was necessary to understand the blessing and what it meant.</p>
<p>There are several apologist explanations for the blessing. They all basically say something along the lines of women are really on a higher level than men, they don&#8217;t need to do as many commandments, they can if they want, but they don&#8217;t have to, men need the commandments to lift men out of the abyss, the blessing recognizes that men are appreciative for having those commandment to elevate them and thanks God for that opportunity. It is not insulting to women because it is not about who is better, it is about appreciating having more commandments.</p>
<p>While this is somewhat enticing, it falls short. The next logical step is that if the commandments are not indicative of higher status rather lower status, why are we blessing God for that? Could it be that it is something like tziduk ha&#8217;din &#8211; thanking God for the bad as we do after a death?  Unlikely. The other morning blessings do not follow this form.</p>
<p>Further, there are several medieval sources that actually say that the blessing is to thank God for for not making man a woman because women are not as special as men. It is certainly a viable explanation for the blessing. As I have written previously, I don&#8217;t blame the rabbis of the Talmud for thinking that way &#8211; if they did. They were subject to the social values of their era.</p>
<p>Chief Rabbi Lord <strong>Jonathan Sacks</strong> offers this explanation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;they are acknowledgments of the special responsibilities of Jewish life. Heathens, slaves and women are exempt from certain commandments that apply to Jewish men. In these blessings, we express our faith that the commandments are not a burden but a cherished vocation&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>In other words, the blessing is an affirmation that extra commandments are a privilege. Well, why doesn&#8217;t everyone have this privilege?</p>
<p>It is easy to see why the blessing is an affront to many women. It implies inferiority at worst or less opportunity at best. It could be argued that just because Judaism has some specific roles for men and women does not mean it deserves a blessing to that effect. I completely understand why some find it offensive.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kanefsky&#8217;s feelings about the blessing are justified. His actions are what are subject to scrutiny. His feelings are not.</p>
<p><em>(Here is what I think about the blessing: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/01/11/apropos-of-nothing-well-maybe-something-rabbi-julie-schonfeld-edition/" target="_blank">Apropos of Nothing</a>)</em></p>
<h2><strong>The Response</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Rabbi Shafran</strong> takes a strong stance against Rabbi Kanefsky. Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s approach to orthodox Judaism is that things are not supposed to change. Commitment to orthodox Judaism and its <em>mesorah</em> mean accepting the status quo and not changing anything. In his mind, not saying the blessing is a change and simply because Rabbi Kanefsky is &#8220;big enough&#8221; to impose a change in orthodox Jewish liturgy, he can&#8217;t. Not only that, but making such a change is enough to push Rabbi Kanefsky out of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The punchline:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But when a contemporary rabbi, particularly one who has not yet garnered the wisdom that comes with many years of living and learning, proposes to reject an element—any element—of the Jewish mandate, there can be no question about his having relinquished the right to call himself Orthodox.</em></p>
<p><em></em>Speaking of change, a friend of mine put Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s opinion in perspective. The biggest innovation in the history of orthodox Judaism is that there is no innovation in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>This is especially true with regard to liturgy.</p>
<p>In orthodox Judaism there are three primary <em>nuschaos</em> (prayer styles). They all follow a basic formula but transferring from one to the next is a difficult proposition. There are enough words, sentences and paragraphs that would make it uncomfortable for one who prays using nusach A to lead the services for a nusach B congregation.</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>Simple. Different communities felt different prayers were important enough to incorporate into their services. Some did. Some didn&#8217;t. Over hundreds of years some prayers were added, others were deleted.</p>
<p>In the Aleinu prayer a line was taken out because it was offensive to the non-Jewish community. Some have said it should be put back. Others leave it out. No harm; no foul.</p>
<p>My great-great-grandfather, Reb Elya Lopian, a Torah giant with impeccable credentials (the Brisker Rav said of him: He is what R&#8217; Yisrael Salanter had in mind when he created the Mussar movement) adjusted his personal prayers several ways. In the introduction to his classic work, Lev Eliyahu, we are told that Reb Elya did not say &#8220;<em>ki shem Hashem ekra</em>&#8230;&#8221; before his Mincha amida, When Reb Elya would lead the services on the High Holidays he would omit the line &#8220;<em>hineni he&#8217;ani mi&#8217;maas nir&#8217;as v&#8217;nifhad</em>&#8230;&#8221; because he felt it was not honest. He felt he wasn&#8217;t really afraid so he just skipped it. Reb Elya also changed the words of &#8220;<em>Elokai nitzor l&#8217;shoni</em>&#8221; into &#8220;<em>Elokeinu nitzor l&#8217;shonenu</em>&#8221; because he felt that the author of the prayer was honestly trying his hardest to avoid the things mentioned in the prayer, but we don&#8217;t necessarily try our hardest so how could we ask God to do it for us? Instead Reb Elya switched the words to be general prayer on behalf of everyone.</p>
<p>I have been told, although I can&#8217;t find it in the book, that on Tisha B&#8217;Av Reb Elya even omitted the references to Jerusalem being desolate and destroyed. His reasoning was how could he say those words when they were no longer true?</p>
<p>In short, prayer for Reb Elya was an exercise in truth and honesty. The rigidity of the words in his prayer book were not impenetrable barriers to be accepted without careful consideration.</p>
<p>There is precedent for changing prayers and adjusting the liturgy based on many factors.</p>
<p>Of course Rabbi Shafran knows this. His problem with Rabbi Kanefsky is two-fold. One, he is not &#8220;<em>choshuv</em>&#8221; enough to make changes. Two, Rabbi Shafran makes that disingenuous claim that orthodox Judaism does not change.</p>
<p>As to the first claim: This is a classic ad hominem attack. If the change is valid, the source of the change is irrelevant. Very weak argument by Rabbi Shafran.</p>
<p>As the second claim: The entire concept is a lie. Things do change, especially in the liturgy.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran, and anyone else for that matter, would be taken much more seriously if he would make an actual argument against the change other than &#8220;we don&#8217;t change&#8221;. Does he have such an argument? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>What does Rabbi Shafran really mean to say?</p>
<p>I think he means to say that changes that were made in the past were either needed, necessary or important enough to make. <em>This change is not</em>. In his opinion, the sensitivities of women who find this blessing offensive are not sufficient to warrant a change to the liturgy.</p>
<p>This is fair position. He can say it is not important enough <em>and others can disagree.</em> But by drawing the lines as he did, there is no room for discussion. One side is presenting halachic analysis and reasoning. The other is just closing its ears and saying &#8220;I can&#8217;t hear you&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think the way forward is to have a genuine discussion about the liturgy. Tossing your opponent out of orthodoxy doesn&#8217;t make the issue disappear nor does it win any argument.</p>
<p>As always, debate and discourse will provide the best way to analyze the issue and give orthodox Jews the tools they need to make the most appropriate informed decision for themselves.</p>

<p>During our trip, we had one group tour scheduled. We were all invited to join a Western Wall Tunnel Tour. At first, I was not that interested. After all, I had been on several Tunnel Tours already, and my tours were with the absolute best Tunnel Tours guide of all time, Esther Schlisser OB&#8217;M. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/30/mourning-the-living-on-the-9th-of-av/">Mourning The Living On The 9th of Av</a>). So I was reluctant to go again with a subpar tour guide.</p>
<p>I went anyway and I am glad I did. On that tour, I learned something very, very interesting.</p>
<p>For many reasons, I was always intrigued by the Western Wall. One thing that I often thought about was that when the Temple stood, it was a pretty meaningless wall. It was a retaining wall for the Temple Mount. Functional, not spiritual. The Midrash tells us that the Western Wall will never be destroyed. It also tells us that there is a concentration of spirituality in the Western Wall.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the wall transformed for our great rabbis after the destruction of the Temple from mundane to meaningful. But I had not heard of a source that speaks of prayer at the Western Wall. So I always wondered when it became a place of prayer.</p>
<p>During this recent Tunnel Tour I think I  got my answer.<span id="more-4212"></span></p>
<p>The Western Wall that we see today is really just the southern corner of the western wall that surrounded the Temple Mount. The western wall was much larger than it seems today. Larger in height and significantly longer from south to north. The Tunnel Tour takes you along the wall going north so that you actually pass the area immediately west of the Temple and the Holy of Holies. It continues beyond the Temple footprint as well.</p>
<p>As you walk north there are several gates or arches that were once used to enter the Temple Mount. They were filled in many years ago but the outline of the arch is still discernible.</p>
<p>One of these gates is called Warren&#8217;s Gate. Warren was an archaeologist who did not discover the arch. A friend, Wilson, named it after his friend. This gate is very close to the area that is immediately opposite the Holy of Holies. It is the closest gate to that area.</p>
<p>At one time, the gate led to a series of steps that one could take to the Temple Mount. After the Temple was destroyed, Jews were prohibited by the conquering Romans and subsequently the Christians from praying in the area.</p>
<p>When the Arabs took control of Jerusalem (in the 600&#8217;s CE) they permitted the Jews to pray in the area of the gate and due to its proximity to the Holy of Holies, the area actually became a synagogue.</p>
<p>In the Cairo Geniza a prayer was found that describes a pilgrimage to the Temple Mount. The Jews would come to Jerusalem from far and wide, they would circle the Temple Mount on foot and pray at each of the gates. In 1033 an earthquake damaged Warren&#8217;s Gate and letters found in the Geniza show that the Jews tried to raise funds from wealthier Jews to help pay for the repairs of the gate as it held much value to them. It seems that it was important that they be able to make their pilgrimages and pray at Warren&#8217;s Gate.</p>
<p>I believe that these Jews set the precedent for praying at the Western Wall. Warren&#8217;s Gate was synagogue long before the area that we call the Western Wall today. It was those Jews who made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem beginning in the 7th century that established the Western Wall as a place of prayer, a powerful tradition that is kept to this very day.</p>
<p><em>The tour also opened my eyes to the incredible significance of the Cairo Geniza. I have taken a strong interest in the Geniza beginning with reading </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805242589/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0805242589"><em>Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Geniza</em></a><em> which will be reviewed on the blog sometime soon.</em></p>

<h2>Parshas Mikeitz</h2>
<h2>The Power of Prayer</h2>
<p>Parshas Mikeitz is chock full of vital yesodos for the ages. From the rags to riches saga of Yosef Hatzadik’s ascent to power as the viceroy of Egypt to the ten tribes search for their long lost brother, inspiring details of Hashgacha Pratis unfold before our eyes. So many deep lessons jump off the pages of our Chumashim that some of the subtle insights can get lost. One such message is found in the dialogue between Yaakov Avinu and Yehuda, as Yehuda implores Yaakov Avinu to entrust his youngest brother, Binyomin, to his care so that they can get food in Egypt.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yaakov Avinu was frightfully worried about what would befall Binyomin.<span id="more-3405"></span> He saw the prospects as alarmingly bleak. Indeed, Yosef was gone and Shimon, if alive, was languishing in a dungeon somewhere in Egypt. Bereft of nevuah, due to his profound sadness, Yaakov felt all alone. He wondered, what promise could the future hold? What could he do to assure that tragedy would not befall his beloved Binyomin? Though Yehuda was persuasive in trying to reassure his father that Binyomin would be safe with him, Yaakov Avinu was not convinced. But with the hunger taking its toll, despite his misgivings, Yaakov reluctantly agrees to allow Binyomin to travel with his brothers to Egypt under Yehuda’s watchful eye. And Yaakov Avinu conceives a plan. He instructs his sons to package the delicacies of Canaan, honey, nuts, spices and almonds, as a gift for the powerful viceroy. He insists that they return the money found in their sacks as soon as they arrive. Perhaps this will appease the ill tempered keeper of the Egyptian storehouse. What else could he do, to be reunited with Shimon and to assure the safe passage of Binyomin to and from Mitzrayim? From where else could he draw strength?</p>
<p>And then it hits him, as it impacts all who find themselves “mimaakim,” at very depths of frustration and despair, He cast his eyes to Shamayim and davens. Indeed, the the Torah tells us that Yaakov blessed his sons, v’Keil Shakkai yiten lachem rachamim – May Hashem Yisborach grant you mercy in the eyes of this feared man you are about to greet. And Yaakov continues, v’shilach lachem es achichem acher v’es Binyomin – may Hashem send you Shimon the other and Binyomin (so that you can return with them to me). It is interesting to note that Chazal teach us that Yaakov prophesized but did not know it. The word acher in the aforementioned posuk is referencing Yosef who is soon to be reunited with his father.</p>
<p>The text and context is profound. When Yosef was sent to seek his brothers, there was no mention of tefilla. Soon thereafter, he is sold. When the brothers embark on a journey to purchase food in Mitzrayim, again there is no mention of prayer, and Shimon is taken hostage. Without G-d in the picture, enriching and safeguarding each step along the way, anything can (and often does) happen. Now with the final blow seemingly so near and Yaakov Avinu at wits end, he davens and everything “just happens” to work out.n</p>
<p>This message should not be lost on us. Without prayer, all is lost. It is tefilla which energizes our dreams and animates our hopes for tomorrow. Davening brings Hashem Yisborach more closely into our lives and gives us the meaning we so yearn for. If we daven, we might even prophesize &#8211; although we don’t know it.  So strong is the power of prayer. But we need not wait till we are desperate to activate its power.</p>
<p>In many ways, it is prayer that is the very essence of our Chanuka celebrations. The Maccabim’s cry of mi laHashem aili was not only a battle call &#8211; it was a tefilla. The lighting of a menorah with enough oil for only one day was not merely an act of re-dedicating and consecrating the Bais Hamikdash, it was heartfelt prayer to our Master on High to renew His profound ahava with His people once again. This is why we emphasize in Al Hanissim thrice daily and in our bentching that the Chanuka holiday is “l’hodos ulihallel” &#8211;  to give thanks and praise – through prayer to the Ribbono Shel Olam. It is He who is the source of all goodness and it He who quests for our tefilos. We can take advantage of this moment so ripe for prayer to bring ourselves closer to the Ribbono Shel Olam and with His help, may we merit shiyamelu  mishalos libeinu l’tova! Chag Urim Sameach!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have not been to a lot of funerals in my life. I have been blessed.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening my family celebrated Sheva Brachos for a cousin in my parents home. It was a joyous occasion.</p>
<p>Immediately following its conclusion, I walked the 200 feet from my parent&#8217;s home to the neighborhood shul. At about 11:00 PM a very moving funeral began.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of these two events and the nature of the deceased brought tremendous emotion. What follows is an attempt to do those feelings justice in writing.</p>
<p><span id="more-924"></span>When I was 12 my family moved to a fledgling Monsey community, our sole neighbors up the block were the Glucks.</p>
<p>Blessed with wonderful children, the Glucks were proud and humble people. Performing anonymous kindnesses was a hallmark of their lives.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, tragedy struck a few short years ago when Mrs. Gluck was taken from this world. The tragedy shook up the neighborhood. It was one the my parent&#8217;s first contemporaries death and it was painful for everyone.</p>
<p>The Glucks were resilient. They bounced back. The children were successful in achieving their goals and Mr. Gluck, Moish (George) Gluck remarries.</p>
<p>Yesterday, tragedy struck again. Driving home from work, Moish Gluck suffered a fatal heart attack, literally yards away from his home.</p>
<p>The pain is indescribable. Four surviving children under 30. The oldest was my classmate. The youngest my sister&#8217;s age. A recently married widow. A community still reeling from the untimely departure of Mrs. Gluck, now struck again is left to help repair their torn hearts and help the family pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>Listening to the youngest Gluck eulogize his father last night was one of the most emotionally difficult moments of my life. The cracking in his voice, coupled with his eloquent words were too much for me to bear. I cried. Tears were streaming down my face. It was the first time I have cried freely at a funeral in my life.</p>
<p>I, as countless others, my father included, owe Moish Gluck tremendous gratitude for a variety of things. In my case, the gratitude I have for Moish Gluck directly correlates to my profession as a Rabbi and a teacher. The mere fact that you are reading this post, is somewhat due to Moish Gluck.</p>
<p>Moish Gluck was my first employer. As a 12 year old neighborhood kid, Moish Gluck gave me my first opportunity to teach. Their eldest son needed someone to study Mishna with him. I was asked, and given a fair remuneration for my time.</p>
<p>I will never forget preparing for those sessions. Teaching Torah to the boy who was just 3 years my junior, was my first taste of the joys of teaching, and I will never forget that. I will never forget the smile on the boy&#8217;s parents faces when they gave me my monthly stipend. I will never forget the encouragement that Moish Gluck gave me, in the face of my first challenge to teach.</p>
<p>It must have been a good experience as since then I have been teaching in many capacities. As a Campus Rabbi, as a High School adviser for Yeshiva Students and Public School Students, and now as the Rabbi of the Pacific Jewish Center I draw upon my first moments as a teacher. All directly caused by a man whose friends and neighbors will all miss, Moish Gluck.</p>
<p>If this post were on paper and the words written in ink, my tears would stain the paper instead of falling onto the desk from where I type.</p>
<p>Let us remember to cherish the ones we love. Let us enjoy each second we spend with the people we care for most. Let us not waste the opportunities we have for love and friendship.</p>
<p>It was too difficult for my ears to hear a loving son pine for one more moment with his precious father. If we have those moments let us treasure them.</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#888888;">May the Lord comfort us amongst the mourners of Zion.</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago I was a campus Rabbi for the <a href="http://jamoncampus.com/" target="_blank">Jewish Awareness Movement </a>at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC</a>. One of my primary responsibilities was to lead large groups of Jewish college students on inspiring trips to Israel.</p>
<p>Of course, the personal inspiration for me, was very often, greater than the inspiration for some of the students.</p>
<p>One episode has inspired me since the moment it occurred and it is directly related to today&#8217;s Tisha B&#8217;Av fast.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span>We always were sure to take the students on the <a href="http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=116" target="_blank">Tunnel Tours of the Western Wall</a>. For me, it was incredible to see the beauty and grandeur of the gigantic white stones at the original base of the Western Wall. The Talmud in Sukkah tells of the beauty of the Second Temple that Herod rebuilt. It is hard to imagine such beauty when we see the above ground Western Wall today. Erosion and time have taken its physical beauty. But underground the stones are a pristine white and appear good as new.</p>
<p>Our tour guide was always the world renowned Esther Schlisser (who has since passed May Her Memory Be Blessed). Esther Schlisser was a one of a kind woman who took these tours very seriously. She allowed no talking, no photographs of her and she brazenly single-handedly led us through the Arab Quarter at the end of the tour during the second intifada.</p>
<p>We began the tour sitting in front of a really cool model of Herod&#8217;s Second Temple and with the magic of technology it transforms into the current Old City layout. The route of the tour took us deep down to the lower Western Wall base stones and along the Wall below the Arab Quarter. What we see of the Wall today, is a fraction of the size of the original Wall.</p>
<p>We finally arrived at my favorite spot. There is a section of floor from the Second Temple era that has been excavated and this is where Esther had us all sit on floor. I really enjoy touching history, and walking and sitting on the floor where our grandparents sat 2000 years ago is very powerful for me.</p>
<p>Esther then begins to tell us where we are sitting and the great men who must have walked these same cobble stones. She then begins to cry. Esther tells us the following (paraphrased to the best of memory):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;These stones are alive!</em></p>
<p><em>My husband died many years ago. When he died I was sad. I cried for days, for months, but eventually, I began to heal and I no longer cry for my husband. This is because my husband is dead and we cannot cry over something that is dead forever. I miss him terribly, but I do not cry.</em></p>
<p><em>However, I come to this spot, the floor right in front of the Western Wall of the Second Temple at least once a day for the past 10 years. Every single time I come here, I cry. I cry that we are exiled and that we cannot see the Temple in its true grandeur and I cry that we are at the mercy of the nations of the world and we cannot rule ourselves as per the Torah&#8217;s command. Jews have been crying here for centuries. We will continue to cry until we are redeemed from this exile.</em></p>
<p><em>There is only one way to explain this. The stones are alive. The Wall is alive. There is a soul in the bricks that lives. Its voice is small, it is weak, but it is alive and that is how we can cry centuries of tears for a destroyed Temple. The Temple may have been destroyed but still, it lives.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A very powerful experience and one I think of very often.</p>
<p>On this Tisha B&#8217;Av, remember that we are not crying over a dead Temple. If it were so, we would have stopped crying eons ago. The stones are alive. They are kept alive by the promise that we will see a Third Temple. They are kept alive by the souls of the Jewish people yearning for their Temple to be rebuild. And they are kept alive by the tears we cry on Tisha B&#8217;Av every single year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once every 28 years the Jewish people give <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkat_HaHammah" target="_blank">thanks for the sun</a>. Why once every 28 years? Because the sun returns to the exact spot in the horizon once every 28 years. This is what we celebrate when we make the blessing once every 28 years.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-sun-blessing8-2009apr08,0,6374356.story" target="_blank">read all about it in the LA Times</a>. I am even quoted in the article! My first time in the LA Times. Thanks to <a href="http://search.latimes.com/search?q=&amp;site=default_collection&amp;entqr=3&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;sort=date%3AD%3AL%3Ad1&amp;entsp=0&amp;client=latimes&amp;ud=1&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;proxystylesheet=latimes&amp;getfields=thumbnail_small.author.pubdate&amp;partialfields=author:Duke%20Helfand" target="_blank">Duke Helfand</a> for putting such a great article together.</p>
<p>Today Jews all of the world made the blessing for the sun.</p>
<p>You can read about a lot of these celebrations and see their photos <a href="http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?s=birchas+hachama" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>One of the last places in the continental United States to make this blessing was the Pacific Jewish Center.<span id="more-442"></span></p>
<p><em>Special thanks to Judd Magilnick for spearheading the birkas hachama efforts in Venice.</em></p>
<p>The blessing is to be recited upon seeing the sun in the morning. Venice is one of the most western Jewish community in the USA and thus sees the sun later than nearly everyone else. We celebrated with a community gathering on the beach to make the blessing. The blessing was preceding by a short Torah thought on the concept of the blessing of the sun.</p>
<p>I spoke about two concepts. 1 was the idea that the grand things in life are there to remind us of the power and beauty of the small things. We make the same blessing that we make for the sun on several other occasions which occur more frequently. For example when we see a majestic mountain or the flash of lightning. I believe the blessing of the sun can remind us to appreciate the beauty in those smaller things as well.</p>
<p>2, the Jewish life is full of cycles. Life and death, morning and night, the week, the month and the year, among others) We use these cycles as opportunities for a new freshness and rebirth. A chance to kick-start our growth. But these cycles are mostly short. I think one of the beautiful things about the blessing of the sun is the sheer length of the cycle. Sometime one needs perspective and a wide angle lens to appreciate life. Sometimes, patience helps us out of a dark time. The blessing of the sun shines its light on that darkness.</p>
<p>We made the blessing on the beach and sang some songs before ending the ceremony.</p>
<p>I had my iPhone with me and I took 2 beautiful shots with its camera.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes. It is true. The Moment of Silence in Public Schools in Illinois is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality" target="_blank">unconstitutional</a>. Let&#8217;s take a moment of silence to remember the moment of silence.</p>
<p>A total of 18 states have similar statutes in their legislation giving students a moment of silence or prayer during school time.</p>
<p>In 1969 the Illinois legislature passed the following act:</p>
<p><span id="more-234"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="DocumentBody">Illinois Complied Statutes, Chapter 105 Act 20, § 1. In each public school classroom the teacher in charge shall observe a brief period of silence with the participation of all the pupils therein assembled at the opening of every school day. This period shall not be conducted as a religious exercise but shall be an opportunity for silent prayer or for silent reflection on the anticipated activities of the day.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="DocumentBody"><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090122/ap_on_re_us/moment_of_silence" target="_blank">Today, a federal judge ruled that this act is in violation of the constitutional line which separates church and state. </a></span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">The suit was filed by &#8220;outspoken atheist&#8221; <a href="http://www.robsherman.com/" target="_blank">Rob Sherman</a>. His claim is that the teachers in the younger grades were teaching the students to pray. In my opinion the teachers were in violation of a very good statute. The statute is very clear about its intentions. Give students a moment to reflect on their day and some may use this for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer" target="_blank">prayer</a> and some may choose not to pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">I think we all need a moment to reflect and meditate on our day. In fact psychologists claim that <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20030424-000003.html" target="_blank">meditation makes you calmer and happier</a>. Jewish prayer is supposed to be part prayer and part meditation. Meaning that we use prayer as a time to focus and center in addition to thanking and recognizing God.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">If the statute is being followed it is clearly beneficial. I wonder why the plaintiff did not attempt to require strict adherence to this great statute and instead decided to lash out against the idea completely and have the statute removed? Wouldn&#8217;t that be better? If the teachers followed the statute it would okay &#8211; right?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">Or maybe the &#8220;outspoken atheist&#8221; does not want anybody to meditate and reflect? Maybe that is too dangerous? Maybe if you meditate or reflect you are one step closer to prayer, which is one step closer to belief in God (&#8220;God forbid&#8221;)?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">Next time there is a moment of silence at a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPSZ2Mu80aM" target="_blank">concert</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQVLdJRu3YI" target="_blank">ball game</a> or at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB6HvJhXdYg" target="_blank">White House</a> I expect the &#8220;<a href="http://www.robsherman.com/" target="_blank">outspoken atheist</a>&#8221; to protest.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rustybrick.com/iphone-siddur-get.php" target="_blank">The Amazing iPhone Siddur</a> (iTunes link &#8211; will open iTunes) has impressed me from day 1. I was in my Camp Regesh office on Tisha B&#8217;Av talking to my friend / colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/mokissmusic" target="_blank">Mo Kiss</a>. I had just got my iPhone and he tells me about a <a href="http://www.rustybrick.com/iphone-siddur-get.php">friend of ours who does web development</a> who had just finished coding a siddur for the iPhone. The application is impressive with the full range of Tefillos for all nuschaos and all the brachos you could ever need. The siddur knows when to add special sections for special days like Rosh Chodesh and the Torah reading for Moday and Thursday is automatically adjusted to the day&#8217;s reading. Additional it uses the built in GPS to find the nearest Minyan as well as all the pertinent zmanim such as sunrise, sunset, candle lighting times and havdala times. All these features are great and I purchased the application for these basic features. I use it and recommend it to friends. It is nothing short of ingenious.</p>
<p>What prompted this post is the latest feature the have added. There is now a section for each user to add their own &#8220;misheberach&#8221; list (prayer for sick people) and it pops into your iPhone siddur at the appropriate spots. This is a great addition on its own but the most beautiful thing that has been added is the fact that this list can be shared with all the other iPhone siddur users. This means that if you allow your list to be public then anyone with the application can also pray for the people on your list and you can pray for anyone on their lists. That is amazing. Now misheberach lists can be shared effortlessly across the world! We can all pray for complete strangers who are sick using their full Jewish name. What a tremendous service and idea this is! That is worth a blog post! I must say that this idea is incredible and I hope it is used across the board. Anyone who has an iPhone or iPod Touch should pay the $10 for the application and use it. Especially the misheberach list feature&#8230;</p>
