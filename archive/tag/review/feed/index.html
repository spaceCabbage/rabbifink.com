Over the last few weeks I have been test driving the siddur.</p>
<p>For starters, I have never used such a beautiful prayer book. The pages are laid out very well. The typography is excellent and a pleasure to read, no italics thankfully. We are given basic instructions for the service throughout and I found them to be accurate and useful. The translation was decent enough. There were some odd choices, but it&#8217;s like a happy marriage between Artscroll and Koren. What sets apart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is the photos.</p>
<p>Many of us have seen their &#8220;benchers&#8221; with gorgeous illustrative photos. That concept has now been extended to the Shabbat siddur. It is not without careful consideration and considerable hemming and hawing that the photos were deemed appropriate. Several writers in the introductory remarks justify the inclusion of photos in the siddur. Personally, I think it&#8217;s an acceptable idea and found using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> with its photos mostly a positive experience. Praying with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is an interesting journey and I appreciated the effort to explain the use of photos in the siddur.</p>
<p><span id="more-7054"></span></p>
<p>What struck me most about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> was that it does not idealize charedim. I know this sounds odd when talking about a siddur, but the photos editorialize the text. The ideals expressed in the photos are very Zionist, very religious, and very un-charedi.</p>
<p>For example, we photos of women learning gemara. We see young women IDF soldiers as we sing Eishes Chayil. The elderly man from <em>Na&#8217;ar hayisi, v&#8217;gam zakanti </em>is a non-charedi man as well. Where there are photos of young boys learning Torah, we have young girls learning Torah on the opposing page. There are even photos of women dancing. The photo for <em>sefiras ha&#8217;omer </em>is a field, not a <em>sefirot </em>or any other Zohar centric imagery. Even the Shabbos food in the photos is not charedi. No cholent and kugel here. It&#8217;s like a Mediterranean style feast.</p>
<p>There are scant picture of charedim. The photos of charedim that are in the siddur do not glorify the usualy hallmarks of charedi society. One photo of charedim is of a yeshiva boy dancing at a wedding. Another photo is the famous photo of a rabbi being leered and jeered at by Nazi officers as he stands in his talis and tefilin. It&#8217;s weird using a religious book with so little charedi influence. We are so accustomed to orthodox Judaism being a charedi centric religion. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> turns that on its head. Religious Zionism is seen as the ideal in this siddur.</p>
<p>I took issue with a few of the editorial choices. First, the verse <em>poseach es yadecha umasbia l&#8217;chol chai ratzon </em>is illustrated in the siddur just as it is illustrated in the bencher. We see third world children with hungry eyes and smiling faces on this page. It&#8217;s disconcerting for two reasons. 1) There is tremendous hunger in third world countries. It is ironic at best to be using these photos for this verse. 2. It&#8217;s makes the African, Southeast Asian, and Indian children look like props. Almost everyone else in the siddur is Jewish. Why use these third world children here? It&#8217;s odd. It leads to another strange editorial choice. For the phrase <em>yakiru v&#8217;yedu kol yoshvei tevel </em>they show Buddhists and some Asian people looking upward as if to imply they now see God. I don&#8217;t like this choice either. We have fellow Jews who have yet to discover or believe in God, why are we shifting the focus to these other people?<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Another quirk is that almost all the liturgy about the Exodus and redemption is reinterpreted to refer to the Holocaust and the State of Israel through photos. In other words, as you are reading about our bondage in Egypt you see Holocaust photos. And as you read about the redemption and ancient entry to the Land of Canaan, you see Zionist pioneers in the modern Israel. Non-Zionists might find this disconcerting. But I would hope that it could subversively influence skeptics about Israel to see the parallels and perhaps embrace the State of Israel more fully.</p>
<p>Of course more of the photos are of outer space and nature panoramas. These photos are not editorial at all and I believe greatly enhance one&#8217;s appreciation of the liturgy.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is a great &#8220;change-up&#8221; siddur. I would not use it every week because I think the photos would fade into the pages and we would not even notice them anymore. But I certainly recommend buying at least one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> siddur and sharing it with your family. Let a different family member use it each week and I am sure your appreciation for the Shabbos prayers will increase.</p>

It was a good choice. As usual, I will review and also discuss some of the parts of the book I found most interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is as much a biography of the Vilna Gaon as it is an examination of the Gaon&#8217;s milieu. Stern compares and contrasts the Gaon with central figures from history and his contemporaries in an effort to paint a more complete picture of the Gaon. It seems that Stern is trying to portray the Gaon as a bit of a reformer who can be associated with modern orthodox Judaism as opposed to modern haredi Judaism.</p>
<p>Honestly, after reading the book I was not convinced of this. It sounds almost ridiculous and the book does not provide a compelling enough case to change my mind. But it was a valiant effort. In this respect the book was a failure. However <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is a monumental success so many other ways that the thesis of the book is almost an irrelevant side show.</p>
<p>One interesting side show was the discussion of the centrality of Creation Ex Nihilo. According to Stern, the Gaon held that there was no creation from nothing, rather all creation was from &#8220;something eternal&#8221;. This goes to the phenomena of certain interpretations gaining popularity and the rest of the interpretations becoming dinosaurs. The Gaon disagreed with Rambam on Creation Ex Nihilo and I never even heard about it. Fascinating.<span id="more-6823"></span></p>
<p>My favorite chapter in the book compared and contrasted the Gaon and Moses Mendelsohn. Most people assume that Mendelsohn was a reformer and the Gaon was a traditionalist. In some ways that is true. But as far as the way they interpreted the Torah in their commentaries, Mendelsohn expressed much greater deference to Chazal than the Gaon. In his Biur, Mendelsohn argued in favor of Rabbinical interpretations of the Torah in order to distinguish Judaism from the Christian neighbors to his fellow German Jews. Emancipation from the Ghetto brought on challenges of debating and dealing with Christian scholars. Thus, his greatest weapon was to argue for the Rabbinic tradition. The Gaon was cloistered in Vilna. There were no theological challenges from Christians. The challenges were different. The Gaon gave his own interpretations to verses where he didn&#8217;t want to go with the interpretation of Chazal.</p>
<p>The Rashbam is known to disregard many of Chazal&#8217;s interpretations. Mendelsohn was very wary of the Rashbam. He didn&#8217;t like. The Gaon loved the Rashbam and used the Rashbam&#8217;s methodology even where the Rashbam himself did not. The Gaon had no problem saying that Deuteronomy was prophesied by Moses, as opposed to dictated at Sinai, while Mendelsohn would not even concede that the last 8 verses in the Torah were written by Joshua.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Gaon encouraged a translation of Euclid into Hebrew where Mendelsohn translated the Torah into German. Both men were influenced by their social conditions. In the end, this made Mendelsohn into an apologist and the Gaon into a relevant leader.</p>
<p>I posted an excerpt of the book on Facebook. It generated a lot of discussion there so I will direct you there for the comments. (Here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101421218867825" target="_blank">Facebook.com</a>) The excerpt contrasts the Gaon&#8217;s defiant stance against Hasidut and ambivalence toward the Haskala. This is further reflected by his rabbinic legacy in R&#8217; Chaim Volozhin and the Netziv who accepted on the fence <em>maskilim</em> into the Volozhiner Yeshiva. Much of the Gaon&#8217;s opposition to Hasidut was based on the fairly recent memory of Shabtai Tzvi. But the Gaon did not have a problem with the Ramchal and R&#8217; Yonason Eybeshutz who were rumored Shabatean sympathizers. His problem was the movement of Hasidut.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is that contemporary Hasidic movements want to include the Gaon in their worldview and sometimes reinterpret or apologize for the Gaon. It&#8217;s hard to take these ideas seriously when one has the full picture of the Gaon&#8217;s approach to Hasidut.</p>
<p>Although the Gaon was a great kabbalist, it seems that he was not a mystic in the sense that he would not emphasize or rely upon modern miracles or stories of fantastic occurrences. Some like to attribute his greatness to a magical ability or a special soul. The Gaon&#8217;s students taught that the Gaon was a self made man. Anyone could be the Gaon. He had no gifts or supernatural abilities. His greatness came from his dedication and commitment to Torah and study. His intense discipline and anti-social tendencies opened the doors to greatness. Not something that was given to him from on High. Further, Stern argues that he rejected the Daas Torah model that was made popular by the Chasam Sofer.</p>
<p>In the end, the book is an excellent read. The Notes section is almost as thick as the content section. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is an impressive book that offers much more than what it purports to do. I highly recommend it. If you need a book for some Pesach reading, pick one up today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5179" title="41QYpzLBEwL" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/41QYpzLBEwL-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1439187002" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. It is unorthodox. It is a rejection. But I did not find it scandalous. Not at all.</p>
<p>There is so much about this book that needs to be discussed. Let&#8217;s get a bit of insignificant criticism out of the way. For starters, I found the writing decent. Not excellent. It got better as the book progressed, but the early chapters were tedious in my opinion. The writing is over-descriptive to a fault. Too many sentences have too many adjectives and adverbs. The book doesn&#8217;t allow the reader any imagination. There&#8217;s no room for the reader to breath. It&#8217;s sensory overload. It&#8217;s almost like the author is trying too hard to prove herself as a good writer. Personally, I found it quite annoying.</p>
<p>The story is unremarkable. Shorter version of the book: Girl raised by her grandparents because her mother is a lesbian who left the community and her father is mentally ill has high anxiety and feels constrained by the limiting lifestyle of her community eventually leaves the community. It&#8217;s not a story we haven&#8217;t heard before nor is it a story we will not hear again.</p>
<p>The truth is that anyone with high anxiety will not have an easy time in any tight-knit, insular community. It&#8217;s not really that chasidic Judaism didn&#8217;t work for Deborah. It&#8217;s that her difficult childhood and personality didn&#8217;t work well in the high pressure society of chasidic Judaism. She probably would have been fine in a more moderate form of orthodox Judaism. Unfortunately for her, she was born into extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Honestly, there was nothing &#8220;scandalous&#8221; in the book. (I will address the one scandal that has been manufactured at the end of this post).<span id="more-5177"></span> In other words, the book, fairly accurately describes the life of a chasidic girl in Williamsburg. It is insular. Education is placed at a minimum. Marriage is the goal of childhood, motherhood is the goal of adulthood. This is no scandalous. This is fact.</p>
<p>There are in fact, renegade renegade mikva attendants. There are libido charged teenage boys who are inappropriate toward girls (and other boys). There are stories of talking fish. People did burn their wigs. Secular books are frowned upon. Superstitions are rampant. People gossip. Especially about young married couples. There is abuse and it is covered up. There is prejudice against members of other chasidic sects and certainly against non-chasidic Jews, especially modern orthodox Jews and Sephardic Jews. Strange tales like eating pig will make you vomit are told. These are just the expected social conventions of the insular chasidic community. Nothing to see here.</p>
<p>But are these items an indictment of the entire chasidic community? Certainly not. Bad people and dumb ideas exist everywhere. The biggest gripe I have is simply the imaginary principle that there are no bad people or dumb ideas in the community. There are and knowing there are goes a long way to fixing those people and ideas.</p>
<p>The book brought me to tears twice. For a sap like me, that is not a good showing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> made me cry a ton of times. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen: The Hidden Lives of Hasidic Rebels</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0807036277&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> moved me to tears a bunch of times. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> was not an emotional book. The only moments for me were the birth of her child and the when she and her son come to grips with the fact that the unhappy, broken, marriage is over. That&#8217;s it. The rest felt a bit detached and unremarkable.</p>
<p>But I like to find social commentary and universal lessons in this kind of book and I think there are some important issues the book raises.</p>
<p>Deborah&#8217;s personality is to question and to learn. In her community this is a dangerous trait. Her first step off the path was learning Talmud. That&#8217;s an innocent curiosity in most orthodox communities, even for a girl. But Deborah had to hide it. She couldn&#8217;t ask questions about what she had learned. With this her rebellion began.</p>
<p>Although Deborah relates to her grandmother as a rebel. I don&#8217;t think she realized how special her grandfather was. At least, what is recorded in the book paints Zaidy as a good guy. He avoids the Satmar politics. He is willing to read a newspaper after 9/11. He doesn&#8217;t believe in superstition and stories like the talking fish in New Square. He is also a bit of a rebel. In my eyes, Zaidy is a reasonable guy throughout most of the book. What&#8217;s unfortunate is one negative portrayal made its way onto the book jacket. But other than that incident, he seems to be a good guy. I think that his independence of allegiance and thought are worthy of praise and if more of his neighbors were like him, I think many issues in the insular community would be mitigated.</p>
<p>Her shortlived marriage leaves many unanswered questions. I would have liked more details. She says they fight. About what? The book doesn&#8217;t elaborate. She talks about their neighbors in Airmont. I am from Monsey, I know those people. I would have liked more about that period of her life. The life of what has become known as a &#8220;Tuna Beigel&#8221;. They dress somewhat chasidic but are much more liberated. Why didn&#8217;t that lifestyle work for Deborah? These are areas of the book that feel rushed and unfinished.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the book was the twist of fate that began with a visit to a Kabbalist. He told Deborah that her number was &#8220;nine&#8221;. On 9/9/9 just after midnight, Deborah had a life-changing motor vehicle accident. She says that the Kabbalist was right. Her number was nine. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think that is what the Kabbalist had in mind. But it&#8217;s poetic justice that his words were used by Deborah to rationalize her departure from the community.</p>
<p>The overall &#8220;lesson&#8221; of the book, if there is one, is that her whole life, as a good Chasidic girl, Deborah was taught to trust her intellect over her impulse. She was supposed to use her knowledge of Jewish law and thought to guide her and not allow her emotions and passions. Her freedom came when she put her impulse ahead of her intellect. Judaism is really all about placing one&#8217;s intellect above their impulse. Everyone from Maimonides to Luzzato talks about this. The trick is to channel one&#8217;s impulse into positive, creative, useful activity. One is not required to suppress everything about one&#8217;s self. Rather, one is supposed to use the intellect to guide one&#8217;s passions and creativity. The goal is to use one&#8217;s personality to improve the world.</p>
<p>More balanced, moderate forms of orthodox Judaism provide a better framework for avoiding this damaging problem. Most careers and opportunities are available to orthodox Jews. There are a few exceptions. Perhaps it would be useful for the more moderate versions of orthodox Judaism to focus on this aspect of Judaism. Even better, if the more insular versions of orthodox Judaism like the chasidic sects mentioned in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> or the new insular communities in the non-chasidic world would allow these doors to be opened for their communities.</p>
<p>There is somewhat of a happy ending to the book, even for religious, orthodox Jews. Feldman says that she is still proud to be a Jew. In a different sense than before, but still, she is not a &#8220;self hating Jew&#8221; as some have claimed. This is a positive development in light of her difficulties with her community,</p>
<p>To close, allow me to address what has become the biggest controversy over this book: The murder cover-up.</p>
<p>Feldman tells the story of her brother-in-law calling their home and telling them that a heinous murder had just occurred in Kiryas Joel. He was personally there as a Hatzalah member and he claimed that there was a cover-up of the murder.</p>
<p>In the book, the story is told as a rumor. The book makes no claim as to whether or not there was a murder. The only claim being made is that this is what she was told. The point of the story is to illustrate that no one would have a hard time believing that a murder was covered up. As a reader, I am deeply troubled that a rumor like this is even possible. But I did not ever think that Feldman was reporting on something with facts to back it up. This was a record of a conversation that she recalled. The issues that remain are not whether or not there was a murder. It is a much more basic issue. Whether or not a murder could or would be covered up. I don&#8217;t think anyone would find this impossible, what with all the cover-ups of sex abuse, domestic abuse, fraud and corruption. That is the real issue. Whether or not she should have investigated and looked at police reports is irrelevant in my opinion. I don&#8217;t think Feldman thought that including this anecdote in the book would be as scandalous as it has become. I would have preferred if the she had made it clearer that the episode was rumor. But that is how I took it.</p>
<p>In my opinion, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> is a good book. Some are calling it a chillul Hashem. I find this ironic. Here is a woman who left the community. She tells her story. The story seems entirely plausible. But because she left it is chillul Hashem. Yet, when people who stay in the communirty commit crimes, acts of violence, are unseemly for other reasons, that is not a chillul Hashem. Quite the double standard if you ask me. All communities have what I call &#8220;abhorrent beliefs&#8221;. Is it a chillul Hashem when our abhorrent beliefs or practices are exposed truthfully? That&#8217;s a hard question to answer.  More important is the challenge of dealing with them in a modern world. This will be addressed in a future post. Maybe even tomorrow.<em> (Update: Posted - <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/21/what-to-do-about-abhorrent-beliefs-in-religions/">What to Do About Abhorrent Beliefs in Religions?</a>).</em></p>
<p>Should you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a>? It&#8217;s interesting enough. Deborah&#8217;s story is unique enough to hold your interest. The inside information about the insular communities of Williamsburg and beyond is worth your time. If you are looking for high drama and massive scandals look elsewhere. It&#8217;s &#8220;good reading&#8221;. Not &#8220;can&#8217;t miss reading&#8221;.</p>

See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/10/22/italmud-english-edition-review/">iTalmud English Edition: Review</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A few months ago we got an iPad and I could not wait to try <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a>. Torah learning is much easier on a bigger screen and the navigation through an iPad app is less crowded than on an iPhone. I&#8217;ve been testing the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a> and it with recent updates and the bigger screen the iPad app is one of the best apps I have used on the iPad. Period.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I figured to give you all a real taste of what using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a> is like I would give you a walkthrough with photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before we begin, I will just say that if you have an iPad and have any interest in studying Talmud, this is the absolutely best way to do it. The Torah is timeless and when technology can be leveraged to make the experience more accessible, exciting and convenient, it speaks to the eternal nature of the Torah and its people. When you think about it, it can be quite inspiring.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here we go:<span id="more-4914"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I always begin studying a page of the Talmud with the traditional page view.  iTalmud provides clear PDFs of every folio of the Talmud. It is a straight PDF with no iOS magic. Functional and perhaps enough to justify spending $40. Imagine having the entire Talmud accessible on an iPad!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0036.png"><img class="wp-image-4916 aligncenter" title="IMG_0036" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0036.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>To change pages, one taps the book icon on the top of the page and using the iOS selection wheel can turn to any Tractate and any page in that Tractate in an instant. It takes about 2 seconds to download each PDF over wifi. It does not feel like you are &#8220;waiting&#8221; when you switch pages. Here I have switched from Shabbos to Brachos in an instant. In real life that would mean going to a bookshelf and replacing one overly large tome with another. Amazing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0035.png"><img class="wp-image-4915 aligncenter" title="IMG_0035" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0035.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to be able to read folio pages when offline you can download PDFs of every Daf View page and save them for later in the Download Manager. There is no charge to keep these on your iPad. Additionally, the app provides excellent audio classes for each page. These can also be downloaded and saved for later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0037.png"><img class="wp-image-4917 aligncenter" title="IMG_0037" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0037.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s move on. Daf View is nice, but the other stuff is where we experience the real magic of iTalmud. I use landscape view for viewing the PDFs. It just seems more natural. But for the other modes I mostly use portrait view. (We will stick with landscape for now.) Switching modes is simple. Just tap the page icon on he bottom left. A menu pops up and you can select how you would like iTalmud to display text. Until now we have been using Daf View.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0039.png"><img class=" wp-image-4919 aligncenter" title="IMG_0039" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0039.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now I&#8217;ve selected &#8220;Hebrew Text&#8221; and &#8220;Rashi&#8221;. As you can see, this view is just text without the traditional Daf format. But I have also selected Rashi and the commentary is displayed split-screen style on the left. The two columns are independent and can be scrolled on their own. So if Rashi is lower down on the page you can scroll the left side down but leave the right side where it is. This is great.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0040.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4920" title="IMG_0040" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0040.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also can select Tosfos and Tosfos will be displayed instead of Rashi. Everything else remains the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0041.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4921" title="IMG_0041" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0041.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another option is to have the English translation displayed. This translation is the Soncino translation with the Footnotes. If you tap a footnote and popup displays the text of the footnote.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0042.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4922" title="IMG_0042" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0042.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve switched the view to portrait. In this view, the secondary text, in this case Rashi, gets moved to the bottom of the screen. I have also tapped on the Daf Yomi shiurim menu. Here, we can see a list of local Daf Yomi classes and their locations. Languages are included so that you can find the class that best meets your needs. You can also enter an address and find  class near that address. Unfortunately, this feature did not work for me. The keyboard kept disappearing. I hope this is fixed in a future update.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0043.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4923" title="IMG_0043" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0043.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes you want to go directly to a specific page. You can easily navigate to any page using the browse and search menu. The English Keyword search is also great. As I have beards on my mind (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/13/the-shave-heard-round-the-world/">The Shave Heard &#8216;Round the World</a>) I typed &#8220;beard&#8221; into the search and the results displayed everywhere the word beard occurs in the Talmud. This is a really super tool. Tapping a result sends you to that page. This is great, but could be better. The place on the page that the word occurs is not highlighted anywhere. This would not be so bad if there were a &#8220;search this page&#8221; option but iTalmud does not have that feature yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0044.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4924" title="IMG_0044" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0044.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the coolest things in the iTalmud app is a $5 add-on. I bought it because it was useful to me and I think it is a great feature. To bring up the extras pop-up just tap on the Extras menu icon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0045.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4925" title="IMG_0045" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0045.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With Biblical References&#8221; add-on you can tap any verse from Scripture that is quoted in the Talmud and explore that verse. So just click buy and then it is automatically built into the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0047.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4927" title="IMG_0047" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0047.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, I tapped a verse on Brachos 2a. Tapping the verse brings up a menu where you can choose which commentary should be displayed with the text of the verse from the Torah. I chose English. The verse is automatically highlighted and the commentary is inline.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0049.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4929" title="IMG_0049" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0049.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I tried to select Rashi, but it was not working. That&#8217;s another kink that needs to be worked out. But the others work. Here is the Ramban on that verse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0050.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4930" title="IMG_0050" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0050.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here is Ibn Ezra. It could not be simpler.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0051.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4931" title="IMG_0051" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0051.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also want to show you a full-screen view that removes the menus and just shows the text on the screen. This is the ideal method for studying. No distractions and it uses the maximum of the real estate. It would even better if iTalmud could do Airplay and be displayed on an external display. Maybe next version&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0052.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4932" title="IMG_0052" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0052.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So there you have it. That&#8217;s how I use iTalmud English for iPad. I am sure many of you would use it differently. That&#8217;s part of the beauty of the app. It can be used your way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have one more suggestion for a future release (my father actually suggested it to me). It would be great if illustrations and models could be provided as well. The Talmud can be so well illuminated by diagrams and graphics. Some sections require illustrations. I hope a future release could provide pop-up graphics for these sections of the Talmud.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other than that, search on the page and a couple of bugs iTalmud is one of the most complete iPad apps I have had the pleasure of using. I highly recommend the app and even more than the app, I recommend studying Talmud.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Purchase the app here: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a>. Check out <a href="http://www.crowdedroad.com/" target="_blank">Crowded Road’s other apps and services on their website</a>.</p>

He believes in God. He follows the Code of Jewish Law. Yet, he is able to reconcile all that with a purely academic approach the the Bible. It is a hard line but he is able to pull it off.</p>
<p>Whenever I have seen questions asked of him about how he can reconcile the two, he always remains unapologetically committed to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have heard a lot of criticism directed his way, by (even more moderate) orthodox Jewish rabbis for his research and teachings causing orthodox Jews that cannot toe the hard line to drop orthodox Judaism. This is really a criticism of some of his students, but I can understand how it is fair to attribute some of their demise to Kugel. Although, it should noted that Kugel has written a book to help those students called &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801859433/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0801859433" target="_blank">On Being a Jew</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I have never read any of his books. But I have read many articles by him and about him. Mostly as it relates to his being able to reconcile his academic achievements and his beliefs. Most of his books are academic and focus on modern readings of the bible by removing or discussing the assumptions made by believers when they read the bible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439130094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439130094" target="_blank">His most recent book</a> is different.<span id="more-4054"></span></p>
<p>A few years ago, Kugel was diagnosed with Cancer. It is now in remission but he published a book of his meditations, thoughts and feelings as his life hung in the balance and through his treatments.</p>
<p>Every single review of the book that I have seen, speaks glowingly of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439130094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439130094" target="_blank">book</a>.</p>
<p>Reading some of these reviews has produced some real good food for thought for everyone. Jewish. Orthodox. And otherwise.</p>
<p>For example, on the nexus of science and religion, this review writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many studies of religion, he observes, begin with the premise that once we understand the neuroscience and evolutionary biology behind religious ideas, we can move on free of delusion. But this is akin to suggesting that once we understand human courtship behavior, we can stop the nonsense of falling in love. If a sense of the Great Unknown really is a basic aspect of human nature, we can hardly expect it to go away simply because we have explained its origins.</em></p>
<p>And in the next paragraph when discussing the age old age question of why bad things happen to good people, Kugel answers one question with another question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Why, in spite of everything, do people persist in believing that life is ultimately fair? For Kugel, the answer has to do with the starkness of religious experience. In a world where man is very small and God (or the gods, or the universe) is very big, there is no room for moral ambiguity or indifference. There are only good and evil, and God must ultimately be good.</em></p>
<p>In the NY Times review, Kugel is quoted about the difference between how scientists view religion and how religious people actually utilize religion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The scientists “have misunderstood the most fundamental element of religious belief,” he declares. To the religious [...] religion is an experience more than a cosmology. “It is not God’s sovereignty over the entire universe that is at issue so much as his sovereignty over the cubic centimeter of space that sits just in front of our own noses,” he writes. “That is to say, religion is first of all about fitting into the world and fitting into one’s borders.</em></p>
<p>At the book event at Hillel Harvard, where Kugel is a professor, one student remarked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What makes Kugel so prescient is that he presents a religious philosophy that is fundamentally different from the Western, and especially the Harvard, model.</em></p>
<p>It seems that people are surprised and appreciative of Kugel&#8217;s approach. For many, religion has become synonymous with fundamentalism and perhaps even a backwards closed-mindedness. I vehemently disagree with that assertion.</p>
<p>On this point, Kugel and I are aligned. And in my experience, people do appreciate the Kugel approach to religion from what I have been able to glean from these reviews of his latest book. I hope more thoughtful books on religion will be published by out-of-the-box orthodox Jewish thinkers. It is a genre that has suffered a lot over the last half-century.</p>
<p>A little reversal of this trend would be a good thing.</p>

I paid for the book and received no compensation for this review. (Nor do I want any.)</em></p>
<p>Last week, my friend <a href="http://frumsatire.net" target="_blank">Heshy Fried</a> told me about a new book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. Curiosity piqued, I immediately purchased the book from Amazon. It was delivered to my door on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>After our Friday Night Dinner, I tucked my elder son into bed at 8:30 PM. I sat down with the book and began to read. Three hours later (and several tissues later) I completed the book. The best determination of a good read, is whether I can put the book down. I could not put down <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. If you stop reading now, just buy the book and read it yourself. (You can buy the book by clicking on this link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> is a novel about an ancillary victim of sexual abuse in a chasidic community. But it&#8217;s not really a novel. The anonymous author writes that the story is based on her own story. Truthfully, the book is based on hundreds of stories and not just stories from the chasidic world. The same story, with a different backdrop can be told by many victims of abuse from almost any insular culture. This includes, inner-city communities, Catholics, Amish and Ultra-Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>The backdrop for this story is a fictional Chasidic sect in Borough Park. The fictional sect is in the style of the major Chassidic branches in the New York metropolitan area like Satmar, Ger, Vizhnitz and Skver.</p>
<p>The story is mostly told through the eyes of a nine year old girl. To me, this is the charm of the book.<span id="more-3336"></span> Victims of abuse say that their lives can become frozen at the age of the abuse. The nine year old perspective is so innocent on the one hand, so damaged on the other hand, so naive on yet another hand and disturbing on all hands.</p>
<p>There are plenty of villains in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>, there are plenty of victims too. But only a few heros. This is how it is. Sexual abuse can ravage a community, but it takes a very strong person to be a hero in the face of abuse. Strong people like that are rare and the book demonstrates this sad reality wonderfully.</p>
<p>One of the heroes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> is a chasidic newspaper publisher. To me, he represents the bloggers who have done the dirty work of exposing this harm and its perpetrators. On behalf of everyone, thank you. The publisher in this book exposes abuse at his own peril. It shouldn&#8217;t be that way. The other hero in the book is the main character&#8217;s husband whose unconditional commitment to his wife gave her the strength to prevail under extremely trying circumstances. Enough so that she felt like an Eishes Chayil, a woman of valor, as the pseudonym implies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> has a surprisingly light tone to most of the book. As it is seen through the eyes of a nine year old chasidic girl, the names and places in the book have cute and funny names that ring true to Orthodox Jews. I found myself laughing out loud many times throughout the book.</p>
<p>As to the &#8220;meat&#8221; of the plot. the community&#8217;s approach to allegations of sexual abuse are all too familiar. Insular communities all share a distrust of governmental authority and prefer to self-police. Unfortunately, there is no self-policing of abuse in the book.</p>
<p>Crying is to be expected as one reads <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>. There are moments of heartbreaking sadness and moments of emotional triumph. The book will move its reader to tears throughout the book and by the time the reader is at the climactic ending resistance to crying is futile.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> is important. It gives real life victims a voice they can relate to. The voice of the main characters of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> are familiar to any victim of abuse. In this respect, the book is relevant to victims of abuse in any community.</p>
<p>I am only somewhat familiar, not intimately familiar with the idiosyncrasies and foibles of the chasidic community. But <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> does a spectacular job of drawing you into their community. I can only assume that what is written is accurate. (I would love if a chasidic reader would read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> and get back to me about the accuracies of the depiction of the chasidic community in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>.) The worldview portrayed in the book is absolutely terrifying. Anyone that is not exactly like &#8220;you&#8221; is an enemy or at best a heathen. The self absorption and ignorance about almost everything is shocking. Characters in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> describe any custom they have as &#8220;The Torah say&#8221;, even when the Torah certainly does not say the thing they are quoting. Characters in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> subscribe to every possible superstition Jewish culture has to offer. And perhaps worst of all, every kind of prejudice about &#8220;outsiders&#8221; that I am sure outsiders can sense in their real life interactions with the community. Characters in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> have no working knowledge of what most communities call common sense and the facts of life.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, I wonder if these characteristics of the chasidic community, real or imagined for the book, contributed the trauma of sex abuse. Is abuse so horrible that the milieu plays a negligible role? Or perhaps is the abuse exacerbated when you have been trained to think that your community is vastly superior to others in every possible way, that God prefers you over anyone else and misinformation is so prevalent that one has to wonder if it is a vast ignorance conspiracy to maintain allegiance?</p>
<p>It is a question that may not have an answer but I think it is the broader question that is raised in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>.</p>
<p>I cannot possible give a bigger endorsement for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>. I recommend you click one of the links on this review and buy the book immediately. Read it. Feel the pain and hurt. Share it with a friend or a spouse and hopefully slowly, together, we can slay this dragon that has been harming our community for far too long.</p>
<p>(This book is for adults. I am not recommending this book for teens. Parents, use your own discretion.)</p>

See my previous posts about the overall event by clicking <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/02/my-appearance-at-a-night-for-the-family-at-pepperdine-university/">My Appearance At “A Night For The Family” at Pepperdine University</a> and listen to my speech by clicking <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/02/jewish-lessons-in-parenting/">Jewish Lessons in Parenting</a>.</p>
<p>The main event was a presentation called <a href="http://www.sandagerpresentations.com/" target="_blank">Time With Corrie ten Boom</a>. Prior to my invitation to the event I had never heard of Corrie ten Boom and now that I have seen the presentation I am shocked that the story is not more well known. I believe everyone should know who Corrie was and hear and see her story in the dramatic way I saw it.<span id="more-2208"></span></p>
<p>Corrie and her family saved over 800 Jewish people during the Holocaust. The ten Booms were devout Christians and believed that their mission was to help save their Jewish neighbors. They did so, nobly. They ran an elaborate placement system until they were apprehended and placed in the camps. Only Corrie survived.</p>
<p>Corrie spent the rest of her life telling her story. I recommend buying her book. Click here to purchase on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1598563394?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1598563394">The Hiding Place</a>. She wanted people to know that those who helped Jews were not just a minority, but they were statistically non-existant. She could not believe that her &#8220;righteous&#8221; neighbors would allow their Jewish neighbors be arrested and killed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Corrie passed away nearly 30 years ago. Fortunately, a woman named Susan Sandagar has transformed herself into Corrie&#8217;s persona. Susan performs as Corrie and tells Corrie&#8217;s story as if it were her own. Pat and Shirley Boone loved Corrie and they love Susan&#8217;s performance as Corrie. They have been instrumental in helping promote and share Susan&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>The performance is uncanny. One could truly believe that the real Corrie ten Boom is telling her story. More importantly, the message is transmitted with the same passion and love that Corrie had for the story.</p>
<p>Throughout the performance I found myself smiling and then crying. The tale is moving and powerful, as well as uplifting and inspirational. Hearing Corrie&#8217;s thoughts makes you want to be a better person and gives reason to believe in people. Susan does a masterful job and the show is incredible.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation. It is geared primarily for Christian audiences. But that may be because only they seem to care about the story. While heroes, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler" target="_blank">Schindler</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Wallenberg" target="_blank">Wallenberg</a> are well known in Jewish circles, ten Boom remains mostly anonymous. I think that is a travesty. Corrie&#8217;s story is equally powerful.</p>
<p>There will be a larger, more elaborate Time With Corrie ten Boom event in June. I intend to be there and I intend to bring as many of my fellow Jews to the show as possible.</p>
<p>Hers is a story that needs telling. She just needs an audience.</p>

So imagine how excited I was when I found out that I could learn Talmud on my iPhone!</p>
<p>For the last few weeks I have been testing an incredible iPhone app. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=326474560&amp;mt=8">iTalmud English Edition</a> (warning: link will open iTunes) is one the best apps I have ever used on the iPhone.</p>
<p>iTalmud English Edition is a very powerful tool that anyone that wishes to study or research anything in the Talmud must have.<span id="more-1596"></span></p>
<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>
<p>All good iPhone apps maintain the beauty and simplicity of the iPhone in their user experience. iTalmud English Edition is all those and much more. It is so easy to use and so elegantly presented that it almost feels like an iPhone app developed by Apple! When you start the app you get a simple menu with the basic functions of iTalmud English Edition.</p>
<p><strong>What Does iTalmud English Edition Do?</strong></p>
<p>The app brings the entire Talmud to your fingertips. You can browse the entire Talmud by page or search the entire Talmud by term. The app includes an English translation of the Talmud that is easily accessed as well.  In addition, audio classes of every single page are available via the menu. You can find any Daf Yomi class in the world from the menu as well.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Talmud</strong></p>
<p>There are 3 ways to read Talmud in iTalmud English Edition. The default view is a modern Hebew font text view. The text size is large enough to read and wherever Rashi has a commentary the words are hyperlinked so that clicking the text will bring up the Rashi. Very intuitive and perhaps the way Rashi intended us using his commentary &#8211; through hyperlinks! iTalmud English Edition also gives you the standard Talmud page view. When invoked, the app downloads a pdf of the folio with the tzuras hadaf preserved. Using multitouch gestures like pinching to zoom and flicking to scroll you can navigate the page pretty easily. The 3rd way to read Talmud with iTalmud English Edition is to read in English. The user just needs to tap the English button on the menu bar and the full English text of the page is displayed. It&#8217;s really easy to use. Also, a bookmark can be placed at any time so that you can return to that spot later by tapping bookmarks in the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to Talmud</strong></p>
<p>Many people prefer to have a teacher guide them through the Talmud. iTalmud English Edition has a full library of audio lectures on every page of the Talmud. The classes are taught by <a href="http://www.dafyomi.org/aboutrg.php" target="_blank">Rav Dovid Grossman</a>, an accomplished Rebbe in Yeshiva Gedola of Los Angeles. His explanations are clear and concise and make learning Talmud easier and interesting. The classes are downloaded to your iPhone but stay within the app so you can listen while you read along on using any of the three ways to read Talmud.</p>
<p><strong>Search</strong></p>
<p>Type any Hebrew or Aramaic word into the search box and you will get a comprehensive list of where that word is found in the Talmud. Tap on any of the pages listed and it will take you to that page and the word your searched will be highlighted. This is really a great tool if you are preparing a dvar Torah or just can&#8217;t recall the exact page of a Talmudic passage you remember. One limitation of the search is that the results are limited. So when I searched for a fairly common term, the results ended after 3 tractates. Hopefully, this is something that can be addressed in a later version.</p>
<p><strong>Daf Yomi</strong></p>
<p>All around the world, people study Talmud. There is a universal folio a day cycle called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi" target="_blank">Daf Yomi</a>. In almost any city with Jewish people studying Talmud one can find lectures on that day&#8217;s stduy. With iTalmud English Edition the location of those lectures is easy to find. iTalmud English Edition will give you as much information as possible. Details include time, location, phone number, teacher and language. A vital tool to folio a day students around the world, iTalmud English Edition, will help you find a lecture near you.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I give iTalmud English Edition 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, a gold medal, whatever. It is a really impressive iPhone app. The price is right too. At $25 you can have the entire Talmud in your pocket &#8211; 4 ways! Compare that with a print Talmud which will run anywhere from $150 to $1500. The app gives you everything you need to study Talmud at home or on the road. Kudos to the developers at Crowded Road for providing us with such a great app at such a great price. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=326474560&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">Buy it now at the iTunes App Store</a>. <em>Check out </em><a href="http://www.crowdedroad.com" target="_blank"><em>Crowded Road&#8217;s other apps and services on their website</em></a><em>.</em></p>
