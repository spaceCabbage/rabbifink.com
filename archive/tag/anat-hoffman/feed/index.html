				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/world/middleeast/plan-to-resolve-western-wall-prayer-controversy.html?_r=1&amp;"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6923" alt="ISRAEL-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ISRAEL-articleLarge-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>All hail Natan Sharansky, peacemaker. We hope.</p>
<p>The world has become witnesses to a very public and somewhat embarrassing battle over the Kotel. Although instead of the familiar disagreements between Palestinians and Israelis, this scuffle pitted Jew against Jew.</p>
<p>The Kotel is maintained by orthodox Jews who would like to preserve an atmosphere that is similar to orthodox synagogues and everything that entails. Many find attempts by women to lead small prayer services offensive. The women prayer services are often led by Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall. Hoffman has been arrested several times for leading such services and for the severe offense of wearing a particular kind of tallit.</p>
<p>The conflict was escalating and becoming more and more ugly with each passing arrest. More orthodox Jews cast aspersion toward Hoffman and more liberal minding Jews stood behind her.</p>
<p>The Forward first reported a breakthrough in negotiations headed by Natan Sharansky. The NY Times spoke with Sharansky and describes the plan:<span id="more-6922"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mr. Sharansky’s proposal involves expanding and improving the areas accessible for prayer at the wall to include the southern section known as Robinson’s Arch which, under his plan, would be open for Jews wishing to pray in a less Orthodox, more egalitarian style 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The main prayer section, which is now divided into men’s and women’s sections, would remain the domain of more traditional worshippers.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me!</p>
<p>Sharansky has close to ties to my family and my shul. My great uncle was responsible for his release from Soviet prison (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Greenwald#Natan_Sharansky" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) and Sharansky&#8217;s daughter married a young man who grew up in my shul. His father, <strong>Alan Danziger</strong>, is the president of Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>Alan told me that Sharansky was charged with coming up with a solution and he (jokingly) asked my advice. I suggested a three section Kotel (men, women, egalitarian) with each group getting use of the best area in the northenmost corner of the Kotel once in a while. I also thought it wise to have non-orthodox Jews participate in the administration of the Kotel.</p>
<p>So I am very pleased with the proposal. It&#8217;s not exactly what I suggested, but close enough. I really hope all parties will agree. The NY Times reports that Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall are not completely satisfied with the plan <em>&#8220;but we will compromise. You don’t always have to be right, you have to be smart, and compromise is a sign of maturity and understanding what’s at stake here.”</em></p>
<p>Compromise is good. Let&#8217;s hope everyone will be willing to accept this proposal.</p>
<p>Some have argued that people who are not comfortable with the current orthodox arrangements at the Kotel are few in number and they are too few to matter. I think this is ludicrous. Perhaps if more people were made to feel comfortable at our Holiest place, more people who are not orthodox sympathetic would come to the Kotel to pray and be inspired.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that is a good result.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6361" title="8097381638_4188c0e0b8_b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/8097381638_4188c0e0b8_b-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>By now you&#8217;ve probably heard that Anat Hoffman was arrested at the Western Wall last week. You may have read her personal account that describes a harrowing encounter with law enforcement. I don&#8217;t know if her claims are true or exaggerated, but her claims are irrelevant. Nor does it matter what sensationalist headlines have been penned.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post we will focus exclusively on facts and then my opinion based on those facts. Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Women of the Wall is an organization whose &#8220;mission is to achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray, and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those facts are undisputed. They are agitators. They are trying to change the status quo. They are activists.<span id="more-6360"></span></p>
<p>Anat Hoffman is their leader and her mission is to agitate, change the status quo. She is the chief activist.</p>
<p>The Women of the Wall write on their website that the law at the Western Wall is that no religious ceremony may be performed in the Women&#8217;s section of the Western Wall plaza. Although this is not a primary source, and I cannot find the primary source (feel free to fill me in), we will consider this a fact as well. The law has been interpreted to ban women from blowing a shofar or wearing a prayer shawl and from reading the Torah out loud.</p>
<p>Anat Hoffman leads a women&#8217;s prayer group at the Western Wall from time to time. She wears a prayer shawl and reads from the Torah. On several occasions Ms. Hoffman has been asked or demanded to cease these illegal activities. She does not acquiesce. She gets arrested.</p>
<p>This has happened several times. Each time it happens the media gets excited about it, Women of the Wall gets publicity, and&#8230; nothing changes.</p>
<p>Supporters of WOW find the law offensive and the subsequent arrests and treatment subversive.</p>
<p>Traditionalists consider Hoffman a disingenuous troublemaker who deserves what she gets.</p>
<p>Here is where the facts end and my opinion begins.</p>
<p>The law prohibiting women from religious ceremony at the Western Wall is a law that is written by orthodox rabbis to preserve the sanctity of their holiest place.They honestly believe that a woman who blows a shofar, or wears a prayer shawl, or reads from the Torah is an affront to God and the Holiness of the Western Wall. My question for them is why?</p>
<p>There is no prohibition against a woman doing any of these mitzvos. In fact, R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein writes that women are welcome to do these mitzvahs. There is nothing wrong with a woman reading from a Torah scroll for other women. Nothing at all. To be clear, the law is prohibiting actions that are permissible according to halacha. I find this hard to stomach.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s grant the rabbis of the Western Wall the power to legislate the decorum of the Western Wall. While this may be offensive to non-orthodox Jews, I can also understand why they have control over the Wall. But the rabbis of the Wall are only granted the right to legislate the Wall in accordance with Jewish law! So it is reasonable that they would prohibit men and women from praying together. It is also reasonable that they would mandate reasonably modest dress at the Wall. But it is not reasonable to enforce a rule that prevents people from performing mitzvahs that they are granted permission to perform!</p>
<p>It is hard to condone the law as it currently stands.</p>
<p>Some people have a hard time giving credence to an agitator like Anat Hoffman. While it may be challenging for Traditionalists to support her cause, the broader message of her cause is universal. All people should be granted the right to serve God at the Western Wall so long as it does not violate halacha. It seems hard to oppose that kind of rule.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really feel bad for Ms. Hoffman. She knows what is coming to her when she agitates the establishment. But just because she knows what is coming to her, that does not mean that her battle is not my battle. I empathize with Ms. Hoffman and I support her right to worship God at her holiest of places so long as she conforms to halacha. She has. Getting arrested for following halacha and doing a mitzvah at the Western Wall should not be the norm. This is a form of religious persecution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only the more liberal branches of Judaism have publically supported Ms. Hoffman.</p>
<p>This is the least effective way to change the established rules. Hopefully, the powers that be at the Western Wall will see the beauty and value in allowing women to pray in accordance with halacha even if it is not in accordance with their personal preferences and standards.</p>
