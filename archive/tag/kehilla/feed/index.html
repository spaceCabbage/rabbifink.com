				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7128" alt="alaska-erosion-photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" /></a>The fallout over the Doheny Kosher meat scandal continues. This week, the Jewish Journal reported that three kosher restaurants have dropped the RCC Hechsher in favor of alternative hechshers.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing. RCC is not as good for the bottom line as the other hechshers. The only real reason a restaurant will switch is to increase business. It seems that RCC businesses are suffering. I have some first hand information from vendors that this is the case as well.</p>
<p>It goes even further. Shiloh&#8217;s Restaurant has a splash page of their website that assures customers that they are and always have been using Kehilla for their hechsher and not RCC. The note distances Shiloh&#8217;s from Doheny Kosher Meat as well. See the note here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gUiNl0R.png" target="_blank">Shiloh&#8217;s</a></p>
<p>All this can only mean one thing. A significant number of people have been spooked by the kashrus scandal. It goes so far that people need to be reassured that a kosher restaurant did not purchase any meat from Doheny.<span id="more-7127"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. The halachic authority who was counseled on this case and is a senior <em>posek</em> for the OU already said that there was no halachic problem for consumers or restaurants who bought from Doheny. The RCC has admitted there were issues and they are fixing them. Some of the restaurants that switched don&#8217;t even sell meat!</p>
<p>The point here is that people are basically ignoring the halachic psak given in this case. Who are these people? Are they <em>frummer</em> than halacha? Why would anyone be concerned if a restaurant got meat from Doheny? The psak is that there is no problem if one bought meat from Doheny? What are they worried about?</p>
<p>The funny thing is that people will harp on Daas Torah for every <em>chumra</em> or <em>hashkafic</em> nuance as long as it looks more frum. But the second Daas Torah says something is permissible those same people become independent thinkers who don&#8217;t rely on Daas Torah.</p>
<p>On the one hand I see this as an erosion of Daas Torah. Some might see that as a positive development. Some might see that as a negative development. Either way, it seems that people are not buying into Daas Torah completely. It&#8217;s only when it suits my <em>chumra</em> lifestyle or to marginalize others that I will listen to Daas Torah they say. On the other hand not trusting RCC (especially for dairy!) after a <em>psak</em> that says there is nothing to worry about from a halachic perspective, is a huge problem. If we do not rely on our <em>poskim</em> for <em>heter</em> we are in big trouble. I do not like the direction this is heading. We must be able to rely on <em>psak halacha, </em>especially when the halacha is lenient.</p>
