				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RH-2012-Card.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6214" title="RH 2012 Card" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RH-2012-Card-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>In what has become a bit of a custom for me, I took to the Venice Boardwalk on Sunday to wish everyone a sweet new year. As usual, I met some very interesting and wonderful people through the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Many people stopped by to dip the apple in the honey which is not as easy as it looks with the nice ocean breeze wreaking havoc with honey drips. Some stepped into the shul for a few moments and we had some lovely conversations. Everyone got free apples and honey and an open invitation to join us at the Shul on the Beach for High Holidays services.</p>
<p>Of all the people that stopped by, three were of particular interest.<span id="more-6213"></span></p>
<p>One guy was an Iranian Muslim. He said his father was very religious and used to pray his morning services for three hours. It only takes a few minutes for most people, but his father was so pious that it took him hours. Then he told me the entire story of Muhammad. He said his father had great respect for Jewish people and used to study the Torah. This fellow is not Muslim. He claims he is &#8220;everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then there was the film student from Boston. She recently came to LA as part of a program with Boston University. Earlier that day her mother was guilting her about where she was going to go to hear the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah. So she told her mom she didn&#8217;t know yet, but she was definitely going to services &#8220;on the beach&#8221;. She had never even heard of shul but when she saw the shul she said it was &#8220;<em>beshert</em>&#8220;! Now she is planning on joining us for services. Her mother will be happy.</p>
<p>My third encounter was with an Intactvist across the way. He gets his own post. Tune in tomorrow for my conversation with the Venice Boardwalk Intactivist.</p>
<p>The High Holidays are a magical time everywhere. But at The Shul on the Beach they are particularly inspiring. Jews from every walk of life, with every level of observance, and of every background join together for services. Everyone is welcome and everyone is made to feel welcome. We invite you to join us.</p>
<p><strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> is September 16 at sundown through nightfall on September 18. Shofar blowing at The Shul on the Beach will be around 11 AM on September 17 and 18.</p>
<p><strong>Yom Kippur</strong> is September 25 at sundown for K0l Nidre through nightfall on September 26.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to join us for services whether for the entire thing or just a few moments. If you want a seat with your name on it, call or email the PJC office at info@pjcenter.com.</p>

<p>This 13 second gem was sent to me by a friend.</p>
<p>It appeals to my sense of humor. It actually made me laugh. Background story below&#8230;</p>
<p>Enjoy.<span id="more-2742"></span></p>

<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>My friend was in crazy traffic (not crazy like the 3 month backup in China) and he had his tallis and shofar in the car and his friend had a camera. They were passing an Ikea and my friend chuckles to himself Ikeaaaa (sounds like Tekiaaaah) and the video was born&#8230;</p>
<p>(Further explanation: The shofar makes three sounds. One is called tekia. On Rosh Hashana someone calls out each shofar blast before it is blown. So before tekia he chants &#8220;tekiaaa&#8221;.)</p>
