				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6987" alt="bill-maher" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bill-maher-250x300.jpg" width="250" height="300" />A lot of people are very excited that uber-liberal Bill Maher has nasty things to say about Islam. Maher&#8217;s premise is that Islam is the <em>most</em> violent religion today by far and therefore it is unreasonable to raise the argument that religious extremism exists in other religions.</p>
<p>The joke Maher uses to make his point is that he wonders (and this is not his joke) if there could be a &#8220;Book of Islam&#8221; on Broadway like there is a Book of Mormon on Broadway. Maher is correct that a Book of Islam show would probably incite people.</p>
<p>To make this argument work the parameters must be equal. In fact, a plain reading of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/22/a-secular-explanation-for-terrorism/" target="_blank">my post from yesterday </a>is a direct rebuttal of Maher&#8217;s point. If there were 1.6 billion or 2.2 billion (whatever the actual numbers are) Mormons living in developing countries, under oppressive regimes, with poor education, and little chance for freedom or financial success, I am fairly certain that you would have violent, Jihad-like Mormons.<span id="more-6986"></span></p>
<p>The same goes for Jews, Christians, or whomever. People living under those conditions will have a greater propensity towards violence and anti-social behavior. It spans all religions, creeds, and time.</p>
<p>We have senseless systematic violence all over the world. It usually comes back to these same factors.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the point here. There are more dispositive factors in deciphering why certain people turn to violence and others do not. Ignoring factors that are universal and pointing to factors that are theological and specific to one group is a fair argument, but it&#8217;s not the only argument and probably not the best argument.</p>
<p>Why did Christians go on Crusades every few years a few centuries ago? For the same reasons. And so when we say &#8220;look at Christian violence from history&#8221; we are not saying that Christianity is <em>also </em>a &#8220;violent religion&#8221; we are saying that the factors that made Christianity seem violent throughout history are the same factors that make Islam seem violent today. But eliminating those factors is the best way to fix the problem not blaming religion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Maher&#8217;s cute joke is a red herring and that&#8217;s why I still maintain my position that there are much more fundamental factors that create an environment conducive to senseless violence than a book.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Bill Maher dismissing a Professor of Hate and Extremism:</p>
