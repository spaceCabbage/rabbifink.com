<p>It seems the &#8220;impossible&#8221; has happened again. Kelly Myzner lost custody of her children last week.</p>
<p>I have not seen the court documents. Although I have read a few articles about the case and I am well aware that every situation has at least two sides to the story.</p>
<p>If you want to see one version of the facts go to Unpious and read <a href="http://www.unpious.com/2013/05/ex-hasidic-mother-loses-custody-of-children/">Ex-Hasidic Mother Loses Custody of Children</a> by Shulem Deen. Whether the facts are the way the ex-hasid community presents them or not, the phenomena is real.<span id="more-7101"></span></p>
<p>It is true that <em>baalei teshuva </em>in the chasidic community will be set up with less than stellar matches. It is true that sometimes those less than stellar young men or women have personality defects. It is true that personality defects worsen in one&#8217;s 20&#8242;s and are further exacerbated by marriage and parenthood. It is true that people who are in bad marriages will see the worst of their society and will look outside their community. It is true that people in a marriage can get fed up with one another and find themselves in completely different religious spheres. Sometimes the couple will seek divorce.</p>
<p>What happens next is the real point here.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the primary caregiver &#8211; usually the mother, is awarded primary custody. However, sometimes the mother is denied custody for a potpourri of reasons. One reason that has been used in court proceedings is that the children should stay in the same religious environment. Usually this means that the parent who is deviating will lose custody. When it is the mother, the courts will sometimes deny the mother custody.</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this: First, the assumption could be that deviating from the agreed upon religious beliefs in the marriage is like a breach of contract. She breached, so he wins. Second, deviating could be viewed as a a symptom of imbalance. Third, the children have a status quo of religious practice and taking that away from them and them away from it is unfair collateral damage. Fourth, the court systems are rigged and they are bought and paid for by the ultra-orthodox community. Fifth, the ultra-orthodox community projects a unified front and unwavering support for their own so the chances that the children will be cared for increases within the ultra-orthodox community. Sixth, the ultra-orthodox community pays for a super-lawyer while the deviating party gets by with a legal aid lawyer and the super-lawyer wins.</p>
<p>I am not saying that all these reasons are true, fair, or valid. However, they are all part of the equation. So I don&#8217;t think that the sole reason anyone loses custody is because they deviated from the religious beliefs. But religion is definitely used as a weapon in these proceedings.</p>
<p>My feeling is that the children of these families are going to need their mothers more than most children. They will have a hard time throughout their lives due to the disparate religious beliefs of their parents and families. As long as the mother is a good mother, the mother should be taking care of the children. A good mother has nothing to do with religion. Good mothers are everywhere, not just in the ultra-orthodox community.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a very strong reason to deny the mother custody. I don&#8217;t think that being an atheist is a valid reason. More importantly, I don&#8217;t love the idea of the secular court system weighing the religious beliefs of the parents to determine custody. It&#8217;s probably not a good idea and it might not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.</p>
<p>Most importantly, using children as pawns in any custody battle is deplorable. But when children are used to keep people in the fold we cross the line from deplorable to cult-like. The community does not own the children. That is what happens in a cult. Parents are responsible to raise their children as they deem fit. If the parents have differing opinions on those issues, it is their issue and they must resolve it. But using the brute force of a strong insular community to win the day is just not acceptable.</p>
<p><em>If I see the court documents I will be able to confirm the particulars of this case. In the meantime these are my general thoughts.</em></p>
