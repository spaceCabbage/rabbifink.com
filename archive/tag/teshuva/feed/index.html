				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article first appeared in the Jewish Journal.</em></p>
<p>Three groups of Orthodox Jews have made several prominent appearances in the media over the last few weeks: The East Ramapo Central School District was profiled on National Public Radio because Chasidic Jews living in the district have wrested control of a majority vote on the school board even though their children attend private schools. The New York Times Magazine profiled the cycle of poverty and charity in the non-Chasidic ultra-Orthodox (Yeshivish) enclave of Lakewood, N.J. And the news media is covering a scandal involving Barry Freundel, a Modern Orthodox rabbi in Washington, D.C., who was arrested for voyeurism and the shocking allegations that he was filming women in the equivalent of a locker room as they showered and prepared to dunk in a ritual bath.</p>
<p>These three stories expose the underbelly of the three major groups of Orthodox Jews in America: Chasidic, Modern Orthodox and Yeshivish. Stories are interesting when they contradict conventional wisdom, and it is unexpected that Orthodox Jews, who hold themselves up to a higher standard of behavior and conduct, would find their most sordid secrets splattered across the press.</p>
<p>The public feels betrayed. Innocent bystanders and victims within Orthodox Judaism feel betrayed. Orthodox Judaism just doesn’t feel as trustworthy as it should feel. Recent affairs have whittled that trust away. Trust is the foundation of every relationship, and without it, religion is doomed, whether it is fundamentalist or progressive.</p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism needs to earn back the trust of the public. The media and their audience need to continue to believe that it is interesting when Orthodox Jews behave badly. Orthodox Judaism needs to get its groove back. It’s not impossible to regain trust, but it requires intent and effort.<span id="more-8899"></span></p>
<p>One of the greatest gifts of Judaism is <em>teshuvah —</em> literally translated as “return,” and the Jewish word for repentance.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/21/making-things-better-aftermath-scandal/attachment/108003346/" rel="attachment wp-att-8904"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8904" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/108003346.jpg?w=980" alt="108003346" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Failure is inevitable. We are humans, and humans are flawed creatures who make mistakes. Judaism provides an opportunity to turn our errors into acts of goodness through the process of teshuvah. When we repent, we are actually closer to God than we were before we sinned. It’s as if a ribbon connects us to God. Sin cuts the ribbon into two, disconnecting us from God. True repentance ties the two pieces of ribbon together, reconnecting us. But the process of repairing the ribbon makes the ribbon shorter and reduces the distance between the two ends of the ribbon. Teshuvah reattaches us to God and makes us closer than we were before we sinned.</p>
<p>In any good relationship there will be mistakes that disconnect the two parties. These are opportunities for teshuvah. Whenever a relationship needs to be repaired, if it’s done right, the two parties should be closer after the “return” than they were before the relationship was harmed.</p>
<p>Traditionally, there are three steps to teshuvah: Acknowledgement, regret and reform. These are the three elements necessary to repair any broken relationship or any breach of trust. The Orthodox Jewish community must take these three steps to earn back the trust of Orthodox Jews and the general public.</p>
<p>The first step is acknowledgement. For most people, this is the hardest part of the process. We read about uncomfortable tactics and consequences in the situation in Ramapo. Our natural instinct is to argue that the Orthodox there have every right to run the school board. This is true. But that does not acknowledge any of the mistakes made along the way, or the pain experienced by the rest of the community. Also, without any acknowledgement, the public sees us as tone deaf to the issues raised by the status quo. We need to acknowledge that controlling the board has not been without error, and that criticism may be valid and that people have been hurt and harmed along the way. Only then can we express regret over mistakes and commit to making things better.</p>
<p>It’s true that Lakewood is a paradigm of kindness and charity. But implicit in the immense need for charity to support Torah study is that there is an accountability issue inherent in the <em>kollel</em> system. It is a system that perpetuates poverty and discourages financial independence. We need to acknowledge the problems that the system creates and exacerbates. This is obvious to observers, Orthodox Jews and everyone else. Until we acknowledge it, sympathy is harder to muster. Meanwhile, derision and condemnation by critics is harder to rebut. The first step is to acknowledge the problem. Then the process of fixing the systemic problems can be repaired along with the relationship between the kollel community and everyone else.</p>
<p>The <em>mikveh</em> scandal brings two major issues to the fore. Opportunities for women in positions of leadership and communal policy is a constant itch in the Modern Orthodox community. When men in positions of leadership harm women by breaching their privacy, the itch gets a lot worse. It’s hard to imagine that a woman with the kind of authority granted to Rabbi Freundel would have acted similarly. But this is not the first time a male religious authority figure acted inappropriately toward women in his religious role with regard to matters of intimacy. The scandal also challenges the status quo of conversion in Orthodox Judaism, especially when the convert is a woman. This is the second time a very prominent conversion rabbi has sexually exploited conversion candidates. These issues must be acknowledged by the community in order to begin the process of return. Slowly, trust can be earned back through the teshuvah process.</p>
<p>Generally, the pain inflicted by violence or abuse to an individual or a scandal that violates a group is not as damaging as the pain inflicted by the cover-up. The opposite of acknowledgement is the cover-up. Too often we have been doubly stricken by the pain of the act, and then our suffering is compounded by the cover-up.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the responses to the mikveh scandal by Kesher Israel and the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) have been heartening. There is indeed acknowledgement of the pain they have allowed to occur under their noses. Kesher acted swiftly in removing the rabbi from his pulpit. The RCA already has charted a new path for conversions that includes women acting as ombudspersons as well as a commission of men and women to reform current policies. These are the second and third steps of teshuvah. Clearly, there is regret as well as a commitment to fixing the problems. This gives a reeling public a glimmer of hope that trust can be earned back.</p>
<p>Fred Rogers famously quoted his mother’s comforting words during times of tragedy: “<em>When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me,  “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.”</em></p>
<p>Look around. You’ll see good people trying to make things better. You’ll see Orthodox Jews who want to earn the trust of the public once again. There are Orthodox Jews who are helpers. Those people deserve your trust.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the “helpers” can replace the people who are harming individual people as well as Orthodox Judaism in general. They can tie that ribbon and bring us all closer to one another. It’s already happening. I can see it. Trust me.</p>

It is worth reposting for this year&#8217;s &#8220;10 Days of Repentance&#8221;.</strong></em></p>
<p>As we enter the Jewish New Year there is an effort  to at least attempt to depart from Rosh Hashanah clean from sin. Unfortunately, we have made bad choices, we have done wrong in our lives. How are we to start a fresh year with joy and confidence if we are carrying all the baggage of mistakes we have made. It can be depressing thinking about bad choices we have made. They all have consequences and we may regret what we have done. But regret does not fix the harms we have caused. Regret can have a debilitating effect if it holds us back from achieving our goals as we wallow in self pity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a concept of Teshuva, repentance, in Judaism. The word repentance generally refers to a person to has decided to commit their life to God (see Wikipedia on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance" target="_blank">repentance</a>). But what of someone who already has committed their life to God and is trying to do their best to make the best moral choices in their life but has made mistakes? Is there a mechanism for that person to somehow come back to God? Aren&#8217;t they already committed to God? What more can they do?</p>
<p>In Judaism there is such a mechanism. <span id="more-6270"></span>That is what we call Teshuva. Anyone can do teshuva and everyone should be doing teshuva all the time. Any time we make the wrong choice we have created separation between ourselves and God who is Perfection. Our lack of perfection stands in the way of being with God and Perfection. The further we are from perfection, the further we are from God. Teshuva gets us closer to perfection.</p>
<p>But how? Once we have acted and done wrong the deed is done. Can teshuva make it disappear? Is it magic?</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is the idea that God is the Ultimate Judge. That means that if an act is &#8220;bad&#8221; it deserves immediate consequences. There is no judge, no jury, no lawyers, no plea bargain deals, Ultimate Judgment means that every act has an exact and precise Divine Reaction. That is how the physical world works as well. If ones steals something, the item is stolen immediately. There is no grace period or gray area. If one kills someone, the person is dead. If one cheats on their wife, they have cheated. In the physical world, our actions have immediate, real reactions. That is what is meant by &#8220;judgment&#8221; (poor translation of the hebrew word din). There is an immediate reaction to our actions from God as well. The distance created by our lack of perfection is instantaneous. How do we repent from acts that are done? If someone is dead because of our action, no amount of sorrow or regret will bring the person back. Same with infidelity. How can teshuva fix the immediate reactions of our actions?</p>
<p>This leaves us with an additional question: While it is true that God acts with judgment, God also acts with mercy (rachamim) how does mercy reconcile with judgment if judgment means that every action has an immediate physical and spiritual reaction?</p>
<p>The Ramchal in Mesillas Yesharim provides a wonderful explanation. First, he explains that the mercy of God is that while every action does have an immediate spiritual consequence, that consequence can be suspended for a period of time giving the person time to repent.</p>
<p>But what of the repentance? How does that work? He says that every action really has two parts. The first part is the formation of intent. The idea and the desire to act are the first part of every action. Then we act; that is the second part. The action causes the immediate result. Physical and spiritual. Each action is &#8220;owned&#8221; by its actor. So when one makes a wrong choice the act is connected to them. The action is the end of a chain that hooks up to the actor. The hook on the end of the chain that is connected to the actor is the desire for the result. So a flow chart would look like this:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Actor&#8212;-&gt;Desire&#8212;-&gt;Action&#8212;-&gt;Result.</h3>
<p>The result is only connected to the actor through the desire. Teshuva is the process of &#8220;undoing&#8221; the desire for the action and its result. True repentance occurs when the actor wishes with all their heart that they had never acted the way they did. When the person truly regrets their choice the desire part of the action can be unhooked from the actor! If there is no hook connectig the action to the actor (the desire) then the actor and the action are no longer associated with one another. That is teshuva. Repentance is disassociating the action from the actor by removing the desire to act. Of course, in order for the desire to be disassociated from the actor the actor must everything in their power to fix the horrible results of their action. But once that is done, repentance can be achieved and the action can be clipped away from the actor.</p>
<p>Certainly, the deed is done. What&#8217;s done is done. We cannot change the past. But we can change our association with the past.</p>
<p>This kind of repentance leaves no room for baggage and guilt. It is a clean break from the past and allows us to move forward to a future of better choices.</p>
<p>It is the perfect way to begin a new year.</p>

<p>As we approach the Jewish New Year there is an effort  to at least attempt to enter Rosh Hashanah clean from sin. Unfortunately, we have made bad choices, we have done wrong in our lives. How are we to start a fresh year with joy and confidence if we are carrying all the baggage of mistakes we have made. It can be depressing thinking about bad choices we have made.

<p><strong>MUST READ UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/19/esther-petracks-mother-speaks-esther-is-observant-it-was-all-editing/">Esther Petrack’s Mother Speaks: Esther is observant, it was all editing</a></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/19/esther-petracks-mother-speaks-esther-is-observant-it-was-all-editing/"></a><a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/45110/‘antm’-contestant-to-forego-observance/#" target="_blank">Tablet Magazine reports</a> that there is a Modern Orthodox girl from Massachusetts on America&#8217;s Next Top Model with Tyra Banks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always cool to see a fellow member of the tribe on TV show, even a reality show. It is more than a little counter-intuitive to see a Jewish girl competing for a modeling contract when you consider the tradition of tznius (something akin to modesty) that has been a hallmark of observant Judaism. In fact it probably breaches most tznius standards to just participate in a reality show, but certainly a show that celebrates the barely clothed human body.</p>
<p>Yet, I was still wondering (hoping?) that somehow Esther would follow the lead of her biblical namesake (Queen Esther of Purim fame) and somehow make a kiddush Hashem (glorification of Godliness) on the show.</p>
<p>Tablet Magazine reports the following conversation took place:<span id="more-2843"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>After letting Esther say a bit about herself—namely, that she was born in Jerusalem—[Tyra] asked her about her Orthodox Jewish practice. “Do you honor the Sabbath?”</p>
<p>“Yes I do,” Esther responded, proceeding to explain the rules regarding the usage of electricity, computers, cell phones, and cars on Friday night and Saturday. Tyra sternly informed her that <em>ANTM</em> contestants work all the time, seven days a week. &#8230; Would Esther, Tyra wanted to know, be able to adhere to the <em>ANTM</em> work schedule? Her Jewish identity was all of a sudden squarely on the spot&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;She replied after a momentary hesitation: “Yes, I would do it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There is a good chance that this was edited to sound worse than it actually was live. I really hope that is the case. However, the feelings I experienced READING the transcript are colored by the way CW depicted the conversation. My main point is not relevant to whether Esther is a Shomer Shabbos or not. I hope she still is&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I know many non-observant Jews. I know many Jews who &#8220;honored the Sabbath&#8221; at some time in their life and no longer &#8220;honor the Sabbath&#8221;. This is different. Not because she is on TV or seeking a career in modeling. It&#8217;s different because the world saw the moment that she made the decision. We were witnesses to the &#8220;moment&#8221;. One minute she was Observant and the next moment she was not.</p>
<p>To me, that is a very dramatic moment.</p>
<p>We all have those kinds of moments in our life. That moment of choice. We are told &#8220;Choose Life&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tablet Magazine&#8217;s Dvora Meyers then goes on to write that this is another harsh blow to Modern Orthodoxy. On that point I disagree. Every sect and stream of Judaism has those who stay on that path, others move to more traditional practice and others to less practice. It is not a &#8220;problem&#8221; unique to Modern Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t think for a second that the story of Esther Petrack&#8217;s connection with her Judaism has been written and is now over. People change. Teenagers do things they later regret. Especially as we are now in the final days of Judgment and we are very aware of the power of Teshuva (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/06/essay-what-is-teshuva-repentance-and-how-does-it-work-in-judaism/">Essay: What is Teshuva (repentance) and How Does It Work in Judaism?</a>) it is important to realize that we have all done things that we regret. Esther dropped Shabbos on national TV but we have all dropped things in our lives.</p>
<p>The beauty of this time of the year is that we have a wonderful opportunity to pick things back up. Hopefully, Esther and all of us along with her will be able to pick ourselves up and be the Jewish people that we truly want to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/200573745-001.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2804" title="200573745-001" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/200573745-001.jpg?resize=200%2C240" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>As we approach the Jewish New Year there is an effort  to at least attempt to enter Rosh Hashanah clean from sin. Unfortunately, we have made bad choices, we have done wrong in our lives. How are we to start a fresh year with joy and confidence if we are carrying all the baggage of mistakes we have made. It can be depressing thinking about bad choices we have made. They all have consequences and we may regret what we have done. But regret does not fix the harms we have caused. Regret can have a debilitating effect if it holds us back from achieving our goals as we wallow in self pity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a concept of Teshuva, repentance, in Judaism. The word repentance generally refers to a person to has decided to commit their life to God (see Wikipedia on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance" target="_blank">repentance</a>). But what of someone who already has committed their life to God and is trying to do their best to make the best moral choices in their life but has made mistakes? Is there a mechanism for that person to somehow come back to God? Aren&#8217;t they already committed to God? What more can they do?</p>
<p>In Judaism there is such a mechanism. <span id="more-2801"></span>That is what we call Teshuva. Anyone can do teshuva and everyone should be doing teshuva all the time. Any time we make the wrong choice we have created separation between ourselves and God who is Perfection. Our lack of perfection stands in the way of being with God and Perfection. The further we are from perfection, the further we are from God. Teshuva gets us closer to perfection.</p>
<p>But how? Once we have acted and done wrong the deed is done. Can teshuva make it disappear? Is it magic?</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is the idea that God is the Ultimate Judge. That means that if an act is &#8220;bad&#8221; it deserves immediate consequences. There is no judge, no jury, no lawyers, no plea bargain deals, Ultimate Judgment means that every act has an exact and precise Divine Reaction. That is how the physical world works as well. If ones steals something, the item is stolen immediately. There is no grace period or gray area. If one kills someone, the person is dead. If one cheats on their wife, they have cheated. In the physical world, our actions have immediate, real reactions. That is what is meant by &#8220;judgment&#8221; (poor translation of the hebrew word din). There is an immediate reaction to our actions from God as well. The distance created by our lack of perfection is instantaneous. How do we repent from acts that are done? If someone is dead because of our action, no amount of sorrow or regret will bring the person back. Same with infidelity. How can teshuva fix the immediate reactions of our actions?</p>
<p>This leaves us with an additional question: While it is true that God acts with judgment, God also acts with mercy (rachamim) how does mercy reconcile with judgment if judgment means that every action has an immediate physical and spiritual reaction?</p>
<p>The Ramchal in Mesillas Yesharim provides a wonderful explanation. First, he explains that the mercy of God is that while every action does have an immediate spiritual consequence, that consequence can be suspended for a period of time giving the person time to repent.</p>
<p>But what of the repentance? How does that work? He says that every action really has two parts. The first part is the formation of intent. The idea and the desire to act are the first part of every action. Then we act; that is the second part. The action causes the immediate result. Physical and spiritual. Each action is &#8220;owned&#8221; by its actor. So when one makes a wrong choice the act is connected to them. The action is the end of a chain that hooks up to the actor. The hook on the end of the chain that is connected to the actor is the desire for the result. So a flow chart would look like this:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Actor&#8212;-&gt;Desire&#8212;-&gt;Action&#8212;-&gt;Result.</h3>
<p>The result is only connected to the actor through the desire. Teshuva is the process of &#8220;undoing&#8221; the desire for the action and its result. True repentance occurs when the actor wishes with all their heart that they had never acted the way they did. When the person truly regrets their choice the desire part of the action can be unhooked from the actor! If there is no hook connectig the action to the actor (the desire) then the actor and the action are no longer associated with one another. That is teshuva. Repentance is disassociating the action from the actor by removing the desire to act. Of course, in order for the desire to be disassociated from the actor the actor must everything in their power to fix the horrible results of their action. But once that is done, repentance can be achieved and the action can be clipped away from the actor.</p>
<p>Certainly, the deed is done. What&#8217;s done is done. We cannot change the past. But we can change our association with the past.</p>
<p>This kind of repentance leaves no room for baggage and guilt. It is a clean break from the past and allows us to move forward to a future of better choices.</p>
<p>It is the perfect way to begin a new year.</p>

Dugan says to a player of his who is crying (and happens to be a woman) that &#8220;There&#8217;s no crying in baseball&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve made a censored version of the video and embedded it below if you have no idea what I am talking about.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never quite understood why there is no crying in baseball, nor why this line is so famous. It doesn&#8217;t even make any sense to me. And yet, here we are. Everyone knows there&#8217;s no crying in baseball and no one knows why.</p>
<p>Try telling Jim Joyce and Armando Galarraga that there is no crying in baseball.<span id="more-2511"></span></p>
<p>Yesterday, Galarraga was one out away from Baseball Lore. He had pitched to 26 batters and sent each one of those batters back to the dugout. He was one out from the 21st  (recorded) Perfect Game in Major League Baseball History. Then this happened:</p>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=5245489">Click here to see the debacle</a> unless you&#8217;ve already seen the play. (I would embed the video but ESPN has disabled embedding for that clip and MLB does not allow embedding of their videos and they take all youtube.com videos down, you know, God forbid, people would share baseball videos and expand their fandom&#8230;)</p>
<p>To explain: The 27th batter was out. The umpire called him safe. He apologized. But he was tearful. <strong><em>WHAT</em></strong><strong>? </strong><strong>THERE&#8217;S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL!</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, I am not here to talk about crying. I am here to talk about fixing mistakes.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball reviewed the play and agreed that it was an erroneous call.</p>
<p>So they should just fix it right? Call the 27th batter out and give Galarraga his perfect game.</p>
<p>Sorry. No can do. If a human error decides a game or denies someone their place in history it is too late. There is nothing that can be done.</p>
<p>Art imitates life. So does sport. When we make a mistake in life there is nothing we can do to undo the mistake. There is no crtl-z (cmd-z for us mac people), there is no instant replay and reversals. We live with our decisions.</p>
<p>One would expect that to be the same way a Divine Being would treat mankind. If you act, you suffer the consequences. Perhaps there may some mercy or amnesty, but your actions are still done. They cannot be undone.</p>
<p>In Judaism there is a concept called Teshuva. This is often mistranslated as &#8220;repentance&#8221;. That is not teshuva. Teshuva is return. Going through the process of teshuva one can return to the exact spot they were at before the act. It is a true return. The physical act is done and cannot be undone. But the spiritual effects of the action can be undone with teshuva.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no crying in baseball and there is no teshuva in baseball either.</p>

<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/08/can-criminals-change-their-ways-introduction-to-the-thief/" target="_blank">Introduction here</a>. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/08/the-thief-part-i-always-a-thief/" target="_blank">Part I here</a>.</p>
<p>Now you know what my life as a thief was like, why I stole and how great it felt. Part II is about my transition from thief to non-thief. My learning of Judaism which caused me to no longer be a thief did not follow a progressive time line. One event did not lead to the next. I do not know in which order I learned which concepts, but it was a conceptual relationship between the ideas, not a temporal one which caused a shift in my outlook and life choices. In addition, at no point in my life (prior to my change) did I ever regret being a thief or have any intention of learning how to fix that part of my personality.</p>
<p>So this section will instead list the various Jewish stories and laws which gave me a new perspective on things. <span id="more-1994"></span>I am not going to quote sources, because I don&#8217;t know them. However, before I begin I will make some philosophical points. Halacha is a set of rules, and because of this I have strong aversion to following them. It is not in my nature to follow rules. Rather, I tend to work around rules. However, unlike most system of rules, Halacha <em>can also be seen as philosophical and moral principles</em>. That is, often when you learn Jewish law you are not /should not be learning a list of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts, but rather you are learning the boundaries of metaphysical principles as applied to life.</p>
<p>The next section is going to be a rather long look at these boundaries and principles as they apply to theft. For the sake of understanding what I mean though, I will for now just put out another example without proof or argument so that you may have a rough understanding of what I mean. One of the 10 commandments is to give Kavod (honor) to your mother and father. The halachas regarding honoring your parents, doesn&#8217;t teach you what to do or not do for your parents, rather it teaches you in very specific detail, what it means to give kavod to somebody. That is, the 5th commandment to honor your father and mother is a rule that teaches you everything you need to know about honor. How to give it, why to give it, and to whom to give it.</p>
<p>Now onto theft! In no particular order, I learned the following ideas.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.	It is worse to be a thief than a robber. A thief is shamed by other humans, but not by G-d. A robber however is better because they are not even shamed by humans!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.	Theft does not only apply to objects that a person wishes to keep. You can steel sleep, thoughts, time, and even objects that a person is trying to give away.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.	Halacha has very strange rules of what is consider theft and what is not. It also has very strange rules about what you can do with stolen objects. This is not a post about the intricate laws of stealing or robbery, so just take my word for it. But a few brief examples, some stolen items can be used for a mitzvah, while others can not. Another is that a thief who never admits to stealing, does not have to make the 4 or 5 fold penalty payment. Sometimes, when an item is stolen, the object suddenly becomes owner-less, because the owner has given up hope of ever getting it back, and so the thief is allowed to keep the item but not sell it to others. I am certain that I am remembering some of this laws incorrectly as it has been many years since I studied those tractates of the Gemora. Never the less, they are strange, often counter-intuitive and worth exploring in depth if you are interesting in the subject.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4.	There is a midrash (homiletic method of biblical exegesis), that an artist from Moav went to draw Moses&#8217;s face. Each time he came back the “experts” said that he drew the wrong person. The man in the picture is arrogant, selfish, and a tyrant. The Moses they heard of, was humble, giving, and understanding. The picture was of Moses as his inner nature and instinct would have him be. Moses overcame this. The message of the midrash is that it is possible for a person to overcome their natural desires and beyond that, go 180 degrees to turn their greatest weaknesses into their greatest strengths.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5.	A righteous person, it is said, will be able to give a blessing to others, because it is G-d&#8217;s will. That is, a righteous person asks what is already G-d&#8217;s Will, instead of asking G-d to change Its Will to match that of the righteous person.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6.	There is another saying that theft is the same as idolatry. To steal something is to tell G-d that you do not agree with It&#8217;s allotment of resources and instead you, as the thief, know better than G-d does about who should own what.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7.	Charity is more important for the person giving it, than for the person receiving it. It is a testament to the understanding of a person&#8217;s role in this world for the “divine plan.”</p>
<p>You might be asking at this point what any of those ideas have to do with anything. How do any of those points change the feelings of excitement and joy from a properly executed theft. How do these ideas counteract the arguments regarding justice and redistribution of wealth. In what manner do these points discredit the idea that if a person does not properly protect their items, they deserve to be stolen?</p>
<p>The answer is, THEY DON&#8217;T! None of these concepts are even remotely related to the reasons why I would steal, would like to steal, or justified stealing. If a person would try to fashion these points into an argument, and suggest that here is a list of reasons why you should not steal, I can and would counter every one of them.</p>
<p>However, what they do instead is teach a new perspective of the world we live in, and a new perspective of my relationship with that world. Basically, theft and stealing are no longer needed. It is counter-productive to steal items. My strong desires to steal items becomes an easy game. There is no reward, no challenge to do what comes naturally. Instead, if I become a person who never steals, not even the slightest&#8230; that becomes a real challenge. That becomes a talent I can harness and grow from. Instead of taking items that I think I deserve, I try to work hard and have those things given to me. Its a tough challenge, but when I succeed it is uplifting. When I look at how I am to give my 10% (charity tithe) to those who can use it, and I accept that those who have things, have them for good reason, I can change my behavior and my attitude in life.</p>
<p>Granted, I still steal today and it&#8217;s something I struggle with. But today, my thefts come from accidentally waking people up when they are sleeping, or stealing time away from my boss, or deceiving bloggers in one way or another. But for a good five years or so maybe more, I was proud of the fact that I never stole a thing from anybody. Not with deceptive words, or with waking people up, or anything. I would not borrow a pen without asking first. I would not dry my hands on a towel without first knowing that I was allowed to use it. I took it upon myself to do true teshuva (repentance) regarding theft, and held myself to the highest of standards. At this point in my life, the stealing of things doesn&#8217;t just feel wrong or immoral, it feels outright counter-productive.</p>
<p>But none of the reasons ever given to me to not steal by other people ever made a dent. It was only through learning many different Jewish topics, that one idea at a time, slowly invaded my mind and changed my personality completely.</p>

<p>It has been a while since I posted a video of Ozzie. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/11/take-a-smile-break-another-cute-baby-post/" target="_blank">The last video showed him crawling to his toys</a>. That was 4 months ago and boy how things have changed since then.</p>
<p>Even more has changed since I posted the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/21/i-could-not-help-myself/" target="_blank">first video of Ozzie playing a game</a>.</p>
<p>Babies change every day. They learn new things every day. We can learn a lot from babies.</p>
<p>Especially at this time of year as we attempt to make changes in our lives. Sometimes it is hard to make change, I think it can be helpful to observe others who are succesful at learning to behaviors and attitudes. Babies definitely change drastically from day to day and month to month and year to year.</p>
<p>As adults we need to &#8220;re-learn&#8221; how to change. We need to be more like babies to a certain extent. <span id="more-1329"></span>We must be hungry for knowledge, quick to change and ready to adapt.</p>
<p>Ozzie understands a lot of words and can respond accordingly. In this video he is asked to &#8220;Bang&#8221; and he does so very well. Ozzie also says his first word. Incredibly it is the same first word that Rami said, &#8220;Uh-Oh&#8221;. He says it when things fall. In fact he said it recently and we thought he was kidding, but later we realized that he was right, we had dropped something&#8230;</p>

Part of a (hopefully) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></strong></p>
<h1>I Think I Can</h1>
<p>With the Yamim Noraim upon us, our thoughts and deeds turn to preparations for the yemei hadin. This is the season of “Dirshu Hashem bihimatzo.” We seek to reconnect to the Ribbono Shel Olam, Who lovingly awaits us kaviyachol with open arms.</p>
<p>Indeed, He gifted us the mitzvah of teshuva so that we could return to Him with love. It is a priceless gift. However, looking back over a year past the task seems daunting.</p>
<p>Can we really recall our every action? Can we justify our every endeavor from Rosh Hashannah past till present? How do we rectify our mistakes? Where do we begin? Last week&#8217;s Torah portion, Parshas Nitzavim offers a clue.<span id="more-1216"></span></p>
<p>The Torah describes the great chesed of Hashem Yisborach, for making the mitzvah of teshuva so easy. We are taught lo bashamayim hee lamor mi yaaleh lanu hashamyima. The mitzvah of teshuva is not a distant, far away concept far off in the sky that we require a leader to ascend to the heavens and show us the way. Rather, bificha ubilvavcha lasoso — it is in your reach and very near to you; it is in your mouth and your heart to achieve.</p>
<p>Our Rabbis marvel at this unusual expression. It seems to be backward. Shouldn’t Teshuva first begin in the heart and then be expressed by one&#8217;s lips? Don’t we have to first feel before we make commitments to change. Why is it reversed? They explain: the most difficult part of the Teshuva process is getting started. Before we begin, we must generate the self confidence that we can truly be better and improve. We must encourage ourselves to take those first few steps down the path of Teshuva. Like the little engine that could, we must tell ourselves, “I think I can—I think can.” In fact, teshuva is not as much about result as it is about effort.</p>
<p>The Rambam in Hilchos Teshuva explains to us how we all have free choice to choose right or r”l wrong. He then states (Hilchos Teshuva 7:1) Ho’eil urishus kol adam nisuna lo k’mo shbearnu yishtadel adam la’asos teshuva &#8211; since each person has free choice as we explained each individual should try and do teshuva. The mifarshei HaRambam wonder, if we all have choice then we must do teshuva. Why does the Rambam insert the word “try” into his exhortation that we all repent? Is just trying enough? The answer is absolutely, yes! Teshuva is all about in the effort. Too often, people give up even before they start. They think that change is too difficult or too late. The Rambam’s message and that of thr parsha—if we just try, one step at a time, we can succeed. B’phicha ubilvavcha la’asoso — tell yourself you can and iy”H you will. L’shana tova tikaseiv v’seichaseim.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back I contributed a <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/anonymous-vs-onymous-blogging.html" target="_blank">decent post to DovBear</a> that generated an <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/dovbear/5867413693300232675/" target="_blank">impressive response from legions of commenters</a> on DovBear. The post was a comparison of anonymous vs. <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/onymous" target="_blank">onymous</a> blogging.</p>
<p>I argued that by blogging about important things anonymously, they are less effective and only perpetuate the near censorship of right-wing Orthodox Judaism. Some went on to call anonymous blogging cowardly.</p>
<p>In the discussion that ensued I conceded that quite possibly, better conversation can be had anonymously and I admitted that for a blog like DovBear, the unfortunate reality is that anonymity is the preferable choice.</p>
<p>Something left undiscussed was the reality that DovBear is not anonymous. Google, who hosts his blog, knows exactly who he is, where he lives and presumably, has access to all his email, searches and web history. Until a few days ago, one may have assumed that their information was safe with Google.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p><span id="more-1025"></span><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=8359356" target="_blank">A New York State Supreme Court ruled</a> that Google was compelled to reveal the identity of a blogger using Google&#8217;s Blogger software. The blogger is question had posted defamatory comments about a fashion model that negatively affected her career. The model sued Google to uncloak the anonymous blogger and the court held that Google must comply.</p>
<p>Some may think I herald this as a victory for onymous blogging. Not so. If one is not comfortable blogging onymously his privacy must be respected. I urge people to <em>choose</em> to blog onymously, I am not on favor of <em>mandating</em> it and banning anonymous blogging.</p>
<p>The Bray of Fundie has an interesting post about his opinion on the ramifications of this ruling which is worth reading. <a href="http://innate-differences.blogspot.com/2009/08/defamation-of-masks.html" target="_blank">Click here to go to to his excellent blog called HaMavdil</a>.</p>
<p>(This is just one more reason to self host one&#8217;s blog. Technically the owner of a Blogger blog is Google and it is their information to share or withhold. A self hosted blog cannot be &#8220;outed&#8221; by Google as the blog owner is the rights holder to the information on the blog.)</p>
<p>But what of the courts decision? How does this affect the blogosphere? Some are calling it the &#8220;end of anonymous blogging&#8221;. That may very well be the case, but a new anonymous medium (twitter?) will crop up and still give voice to the anony-addicts out there. So really, the voice of the anonymous will not be quelled it will just need to move its home base.</p>
<p>The prospect of Google sharing our information is more worrisome than anything else. Everything we do is being recorded by Google. That can seem very scary.</p>
<p>Yet, when we reflect on this idea we can ask ourselves, is it so strange to us that our lives are being recorded by Google? Is it such a foreign concept that our every movement has meaning and does not disappear into the oblivion of infinite time and space?</p>
<p>Of course it is not. Our Rabbis teach us &#8220;V&#8217;chol ma&#8217;asecha b&#8217;sefer nichtavim&#8221;. All our actions are recorded in a &#8220;book&#8221;. Obviously, this cannot be a real, leather-bound volume published by Harper-Collins. I understsand this to mean that each of our actions has cosmic ramifications. Whenever we act, it affects us and the world is affected. None of our actions are meaningless that they would go &#8220;unrecorded&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is what Elul and the High Holidays are about. Realizing that our decisions and choices make real differences and hopefully adjusting our lives accordingly to make good and true choices.</p>
<p>The court decision in favor of the fashion model comes at a great time. We can take stock and learn a lesson about what it means for our lives to &#8220;recorded&#8221;; what it means to live life with the understanding that everything we do matters.</p>
<p>At some point we all will need to face our life&#8217;s choices. Let&#8217;s make the right choices.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s big sports news involved my favorite athlete to hate, Brett Favre.</p>
<p>I mentioned Favre a while back in a post about immaturity and athletes. Back then, I was contrasting the complimentary way in which Favre is recognized for his youthful exuberance and the way athletes who act immaturely and hold out for money or take PEDs are lambasted. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/03/11/does-jeff-mcgregor-learn-messilas-yesharim/" target="_blank">(Read all about it here.)</a></p>
<p>I dislike Favre, but it is not really his fault. ESPN makes me hate Favre with over-reporting and unprofessional, blatant favoritism and flattery of Favre. It is just impossible to like a guy who is in the news that much.</p>
<p>For others, the hatred toward Favre is due to his &#8220;treachery&#8221;. To illustrate I have some photos for you.<span id="more-1012"></span></p>

<p>You see, to most people the &#8220;real&#8221; Brett Favre is the one on left. He is wearing a Green Bay Packers jersey. Favre became a superstar in Green Bay and carried the franchise for a decade and half. Then he retired.</p>
<p>Retirement did not suit Favre well and he came out of retirement and was traded to the New York Jets, that is the middle picture. The Jets had to guarantee they would not parlay Favre to the hated Minnesota Vikings, lest they suffer a tremendous penalty. The season started well for Favre and his Jets, but the season was derailed and injury forced Favre into retirement, again.</p>
<p>In February 2009, Favre unequivocally stated that he will stay retired this time.</p>
<p>In June 2009, Favre expressed interest in returning to the NFL once again, this time as a Minnesota Viking. After flirting with the idea, Favre clearly expressed that he was not returning to the NFL and he was staying retired.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Favre signed a 2 year deal with the Vikings. That is the picture on the right.</p>
<p>To Packers fans this was treason. Like a Hatfield becoming a McCoy, a Montague becoming a Capulet or a Jet becoming a Shark, this was perfidy.</p>
<p>Packers fans are burning Favre jerseys in effigy for his mutiny.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable for an athlete or even a fan to think that treachery is possible in sports? How is this normal? Are sports so powerful that it becomes like a religion, a marriage or nationalism that is so important that if one changes teams it is treason?</p>
<p>Seriously. People take sports way too seriously. I enjoy sports, I follow sports and I watch a lot of sports. Don&#8217;t think for one second that I treat it like a religion. In fact I can prove it. I am a sports polygamist (<em><a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/020226.html" target="_blank">see here for definition and the opposing point of view</a></em>). I like a few teams in every sport. People look at me in horror when I explain to them that I like 2 NFL teams equally. Or that I follow 7 or 8 baseball teams. They don&#8217;t &#8220;accept me&#8221; as a real fan. &#8220;You can only root for one team&#8221; they say. Says who? Is it like religion where you need to choose? Is it like marriage, one wife or husband per person?</p>
<p>Favre sees through those &#8220;sports as religion&#8221; fanatics. Favre sees it as a game, as a business and as entertainment, and that is exactly what it is. He wants to play, he is going to play and he doesn&#8217;t care for whom.</p>
<p>There can only be treason when something is so important and vital that reneging on that thing is harmful. Sports are not in that category.</p>
<p>Another example of placing too much meaning in sports comes up in the Performance Enhancing Drugs in basbeall argumnent. You will hear critics say that the PEDs besmirch the sanctity of the game. Is there anything more self contradictory than &#8220;sanctity of a game&#8221;?!?! The whole is that is it is a game! An escape from sanctity! Sanctity is part of religion, not baseball. Sports are a game, entertainment. There is no sanctity and there is no treason.</p>
<p>But there are things that have sanctity and there is treason. As a Rabbi, I think it is supremely important for everyone to develop a theology that they believe in strongly. That belief should be strongly enough that reneging on that belief would be treacherous. We should constantly reevaluate our position,and perhaps treason is the right decision at some point, ala Raoul Wallenberg. The point is that we should find things in our life that we believe with conviction. We need an understanding of what is right and what is wrong, what is true and what is false.</p>
<p>As I heard many times from Rabbi Motti Berger, &#8220;Truth is something worth dying for and in some cases, worth killing for&#8221;. What is that truth?</p>
<p>Tonight is the first day of Elul. the last month of the Jewish calendar. That means judgment day is just a month away. It is high time to kick into gear and work out our true beliefs. Only when we know what we are willing to die for can we begin to live for something.</p>
