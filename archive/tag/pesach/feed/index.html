				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6830" alt="Pesach meal" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pesach-meal-300x197.jpg" width="300" height="197" />For most Jews, Passover is a pilgrimage. Instead of the pilgrimage of our forefathers to the Temple Mount, today we make a pilgrimage to our parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces, cousins, aunts, and uncles or some combination thereof. The holiday of Pesach as we call it, or the Holiday of Matzos as it is called in the Torah, or the Time of our Freedom and Holiday of the Spring as the day is known to the rabbis of the Talmud, could be said to have been supplanted by a new name, the Holiday of Family.</p>
<p>They say that one of the secrets of happy couples is that they share wonderful memories together. The combination of the experience and the positive memory associated with the common experience creates an environment where a good relationship can flourish.</p>
<p>I advise couples to actively try to create good memories. Do things together that are fun and exciting. Plan activities that will create those memories. And reminisce. Always look fondly upon those moments, cherish the memories, and plan more memory making merriment.<span id="more-6829"></span></p>
<p>This may sound a bit like cheating. It&#8217;s almost like artificially manufacturing a relationship. But it&#8217;s not cheating. It&#8217;s playing smart. No relationship can survive on the fumes of romance or even true love with no help. You need to stoke the flames, you need to create a common language, you need to have good memories.</p>
<p>Religion is a lot like a relationship.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways of transmitting a love and excitement about Judaism is by creating good Jewish memories and associations. Nostalgia plays a large role in our lives. A song takes us back to our teenage angst, a smell takes us back to a vacation, an old friend takes us back to simpler times. When we are down, there&#8217;s nothing quite like Mom&#8217;s cooking to make everything all good again.</p>
<p>While religion must grow into something more sophisticated and mature than simple nostalgia, leveraging the natural feelings of nostalgia is a great way to augment one&#8217;s spirituality. After all, God gave us nostalgia. Let us use it.</p>
<p>The Seder is the perfect time to craft those memories. The smells, tastes, customs, and discussions of the Seder will linger decades after we sing Chad Gadya at the conclusion of our Seder. The content of the Haggadah and what we are able to learn and find inspirational during the Seder is so important, but the flavor and tone of our Seder will make a lasting impact as well. Who joins in our Seder will make a difference too. When we associate our family, and good feelings with the Seder, we have a formula that can create memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no shame in trying to create those memories. In fact, I encourage it. Make the Seder special. Make the Seder consistent.  Make the Seder a time for family. Make your own family traditions.</p>
<p>The story of the Exodus is as much a story of salvation as it is a story of becoming a family. We experienced an incredible exodus together and it bonded us together as a family. We relive those memories every year. This is one of the great ideas in the Haggadah. But we must also create our own new memories.</p>
<p>A New York Times article published last week drives home a similar message. The article proposes that <em>&#8220;The single most important thing you can do for your family may be the simplest of all: develop a strong family narrative.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This is a clumsy way of saying that families need to know their story. Families that are happiest know answers to questions like these: <em>Do you know where your grandparents grew up? Do you know where your mom and dad went to high school? Do you know where your parents met? Do you know an illness or something really terrible that happened in your family? Do you know the story of your birth?</em></p>
<p>Our stories and our collective memories create strong families. Strong families foster confident, well-adjusted, happy children. This is wisdom found in a New York Times article in 2013. It is also found in our ancient Seder traditions. Even before the formal Seder was established, the Torah itself tells us to tell our children our story. We are charged with mastering our national narrative. So many of our rituals come back to the same point &#8211; &#8220;because God took us out of Egypt&#8221;. This is our way of reminded ourselves of our family story. It is so important that the Torah mentions it dozens of times.</p>
<p>One of the secrets of Judaism is our story telling. We read the stories in the Bible every week. Our Talmud is stock full of stories of our sages. Stories are one of the languages of Judaism. The Seder is a time to tell the story of our forefather, but is also the time to write our own, new stories.</p>
<p>This year, and every year, let us use the Holiday of Family, Pesach with its Seder to retell our national story and the birth of our nation, but also to write new chapters in our own family stories and create positive memories and associations with our religious experiences. In this way we will do our part in passing our beautiful tradition to the future of Judaism.</p>

En route, we made a stopover in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
<p>I know many people who are uncomfortable with anything remotely German. They do not buy products from Germany, they would never visit for recreation, and they have a general distaste for the German language. I understand these people. I am not one of them.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to let go of the feelings that associate the Holocaust to Nazis and Nazis to Germans. For some, it is disrespectful to those who perished in the Holocaust to treat Germans like everybody else. I am not judging these people. At all.</p>
<p>As I said, I am not one of these people. It could be that I had no family who fell victim to the Nazis so it is less personal for me. I like to think that I should bear no resentment towards grandchildren and great-grandchildren of murderers. After all, they committed no crime. The physical land caused us no harm and the people who caused the harm are long gone. It seems that hatred towards present day Germany is irrational at best.</p>
<p>But again, I can understand this irrational belief.</p>
<p>In fact, when I think of Frankfurt or Germany my mind immediately turns toward R&#8217; Hirsch and then to the incredible legacy of German Torah and Judaism stretching back to the first exile 2500 years ago.</p>
<p>Just because I have positive feelings towards modern Germany does not mean that the recent significance of the place is lost on me. I felt a particularly strong stirring inside me as our El Al jet raced down the runway and took off towards Israel. The surge of emotion that I felt brought tears to my eyes. It relates to Pesach and I think provides us a nice message as we begin this year&#8217;s Pesach celebration.<span id="more-5380"></span></p>
<p>What would our brothers and sisters have done 70 years ago to hop on a plane in Franfurt and fly to Israel. First of all, they were not free to leave. They were in concentration camps, death camps, in death marches, in hiding, or on the run. Our Jewish brothers and sisters could not just leave the country like I did today.</p>
<p>More importantly, they had no Land of Israel to go to! Today, any Jew who wants to go home has a home in Israel. Seventy years ago, there was no Jewish homeland. Today there is a Jewish homeland. Imagine the emotional lift the victims of the Holocaust may have felt had they known that if they survived, they would be able to settle in Israel.</p>
<p>So taking off in Germany and landing in Israel on an El Al plane is a powerful thing. We cannot overlook how lucky we are that we can choose to freely make that trip that so many before us have yearned for so strongly.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that we should also pause and reflect on these modern times where previously held and entrenched (false) ideas about people who are different from one another are slowly being purged from our global community. There is plenty of work to be done. But it is worth considering how far we have come as well.</p>
<p>As we head into Pesach and we are commanded to feel the freedom our forefathers felt as they left Egypt, it seems prudent to revisit the more recent euphoric redemption that rose from the ashes of the Holocaust. In these heady times of freedom and a Jewish homeland it can be difficult to conjure up the emotions of a nation in slavery in search for a homeland. For more than 1500 years, the seder was a rallying call to return to the land of Israel and to feel free once again. Today we are free and we can all go to Israel if we chose to do so.</p>
<p>We have so much for which we must be thankful. The Jewish world today is nothing like the Jewish world from which so many of our grandparents and great grandparents came. Sometimes, it takes an El Al flight from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv mere hours before Pesach to put it all in perspective.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone a chag kasher v&#8217;sameach.</p>

No one can see him, but some people could swear that his cup is not quite as full as it was when it was poured.</p>
<p>In my review of the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/03/27/the-new-american-haggadah-book-review/">The New American Haggadah | Book Review</a>, I mentioned in passing that the idea that Elijah the Prophet visits Jewish homes on Passover is not as obvious as most people think. I have challenged people at my seder to find a real, serious source for this belief. None has been provided as of yet. At my Seder I don&#8217;t open the door for Elijah. I do open the door for Shfoch Chamascha, but not for the prophet.</p>
<p>There is not one mention of this yearly visit to every Jewish home in the entire corpus of Talmud or Midrash. I only know this because I have seen the research of others. I would not be able to make a statement like that on my own. Maybe one day.</p>
<p><span id="more-5372"></span></p>
<p>According to an article in the Jewish Action the first mention of this nocturnal visit was in the 15th century. You read that right. Until the 15th century it seems that no one imagined that Elijah visited their seder. Is it possible that he only started visiting seders in the last 600 years? Seems unlikely.</p>
<p>I think the source of confusion is actually pretty reasonable. There is an obligation to drink four cups of wine at the seder. This is alluded to by the four expressions of redemption in Exodus. There is a fifth expression that sounds almost like an expression of redemption but there is no corresponding cup. The word is v&#8217;heiveisi, God says &#8220;I will bring&#8221; you to the Land of Israel. To symbolize this fifth expression a fifth cup is poured but not drunk. This further alludes to our hope that we will all be brought back to the Land of Israel in its full splendor and glory. We fill this cup just as we make those prayers in our seder during Hallel and Nirtzah.</p>
<p>The cup became known as the Cup of Elijah because it is Elijah the Prophet who will usher in the redemption.</p>
<p>Another twist is that some say that we will drink a fifth cup once we are redeemed. Others disagree.  Elijah will resolve the disputes in the future and so this cup of dispute is known by his name.</p>
<p>Meanhwhile, Hallel begins with an symbolic opening of our doors to proclaim that we are confident in our relationship with God. Just after filling a cup of redemption the door is opened. It is easy to see how the imagination could wander a bit and to add some spice to a long seder the legend of Elijah visiting our homes was born.</p>
<p>Does this mean that this legend is wrong? Is it bad or harmful?</p>
<p>It could be. But I don&#8217;t think it has to be. The truth is that our traditions have changed and adjusted over time. This is another example of that phenomena. But it is harmful to pretend that the tradition is as ancient as the seder itself.</p>
<p>When you open the door at your seder, think about the development of Judaism in general and in particular the legend of Elijah the Prophet.</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Pesach 2012</h2>
<p>Shir Hashirim Shlomo Hameelech’s great Song of Songs, teaches us just how much <em>kivayachol</em>, Hashem Yisborach loves us. This relationship is <em>kodesh kadashim</em> but is so difficult to comprehend. Nevertheless, it is part and parcel of the <em>zman cheiruseinu</em>. In fact, it is of the deepest fundamental <em>yesodos</em> of our Pesach experience. It is the ambition we seek in our <em>Sede</em> ritual. How are we to capture its essence and elevate our <em>yom tov</em> sensation to the madreiga of “<em>ahavas klulosayich</em>” which we all aspire to feel? One midrash can help.<span id="more-5338"></span></p>
<p>Most our familiar with the phrase from Shir Hashirim, <em>kol dodi henei zeh ba</em>. We are familiar as well with the <em>medrashic</em> statement <em>zeh Melech haMashiach</em>!  However, many are not well versed with the entirety of the medrash. Let us explore further. As this powerful <em>aggadah</em> in Shir Hashirim Rabbah (2:19) commences it states; <em>“R’ Yehuda omeir kol dodi zeh Moshe Rabbeinu</em>” and it begins a narrative which is repeated with a series of variations all echoing an identical theme. Says the <em>medrash</em>, when Moshe Rabbeinu announced to klal Yisrael that it is time for you to be redeemed they responded, how so? Could it be true that the time for geula has arrived? It is not yet time (400 years have not passed), we are not worthy, we have no <em>maasim tovim</em> and we have <em>r”l </em>filled the streets of Mitzryaim with our worship of <em>avodah zarah</em>? How could we be <em>roei</em> for <em>geula</em>?</p>
<p>The medrash records Moshe response. It is written in two ways with a very a subtle disparity between them. In one instance the Medrash records that Moshe told Klal Yisrael, do not worry,<em> ho’eel v’Hu chafetz b’geluaschem eino mabit b’maseichem haraaim</em>. Since He (Hashem Yisborach) wants to redeem you, He looks not at your actions and He will take you out of Mitzrayim. In the subsequent report of Moshe Rabbeinu’s conversation with Klal Yisrael an almost identical refrain is provided. Just one word is different, the word <em>v’Hu</em> (and He) is left out. Instead it reads <em>ho’eel v’chafetz b’geulaschem eino mabit</em>. . . this can be understood to mean since you, Klal Yisrael, truly desire <em>geula</em> and the connection to the Shechina it brings, Hashem Yisborach will overlook your iniquities and deliver you from the bondage of Egypt!</p>
<p>In other words, Moshe Rabbeinu tells Bnai Yisrael, Hashem Yisborach’s decision to ignore our <em>aveiros</em> and provide us with <em>geula</em> is dependent upon our desire to be closer to Him. If we want it – it will be! Such is the <em>ahavas klulosayich, </em>our a bi-directional relationship with Kiviyachol, the Ribbono Shel Olam. We need to give ourselves to Him and He, in turn, gives Himself to us. Indeed, the more we want Him in our lives the more He will allow us to feel His presence in all that we do. That is the essence of the <em>Ahava</em> – the loving and giving that we must feel for Hakadosh Baruch Hu if we want to feel His love in our lives.</p>
<p><em>Kol dodi henei zeh bah</em>. We must remember that the triumph of the <em>seder</em> ritual is found in attaining the<em> </em>relationship<em> </em>of a<em>havas klulosayich. </em>It is the ultimate <em>Avodah </em>of the Seder experience. Beginning with the <em>arabah kosos</em>, it is the goal we seek as we ascend the fifteen steps of the <em>simanei haseder.</em> Each one brings us ever closer to the ultimate <em>dveikus baShechina</em>. If we are successful we arrive to the <em>madreiga</em> of <em>nirtzah - </em>where our want for Him is matched by His desire for us. What a valuable message for us all; He is waiting for us still! We know that Mitzrayim is the quintessential definition of the <em>geula</em> paradigm. A <em>geula </em>we need now more than ever. And more than ever, it depends on us. We need to want it so He will too. We must ask ourselves, <em>tzipisa liyeshua</em>? Are we anticipating salvation? The <em>kol hataor</em>, the voice of <em>mashiach</em> is waiting for ours to join him song. Why not now? Surely, it is time for us all to sing.</p>

What do I know?</p>
<p>Before I even cracked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> open I had a basic idea of what to expect. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is designed to be an avant garde hagaddah. It is artistic in an almost postmodern way, it is typographically pleasing, the commentary is meant to inspire American Jews, and it was not orthodox. The commentary was written by Jeffrey Goldberg, Lemony Snicket, Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, and Nathaniel Deutsch. The translation was done by Nathan Englander. The hagaddah was edited by  Jonathan Safran Foer.</p>
<p>One of the things I was looking for in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> was whether it would be acceptable to orthodox Jews. Was there anything that would offend the orthodox Jewish adherence to halacha and general worldview? Another thing I wondered was if the commentary was any good without considering the blood pressure of orthodox Jews. The last thing I wanted to see about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> was if I would enjoy its presentation of the haggadah and Seder experience.</p>
<p>So on Shabbos afternoon I read through the whole thing.<span id="more-5315"></span> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> has three basic functions. There is the text of the haggadah in the original Hebrew plus a contemporary English translation. There is a running timeline of Jewish history with a focus on Passover, that is completely independent of the hagaddah and Passover narrative that runs through the haggadah. There is also a collection of essays and food for thought during the highlights of the haggadah. Throughout the haggadah, instructions and laws are outlined and they are accurate enough. The specific amounts of the portions is not precise. They are not wrong. They are just vague.</p>
<p>My impressions of the text and translation is overwhelmingly positive. The text is true to the orthodox Jewish tradition. This was reassuring. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, but since the Seder has taken on many different iterations throughout modernity, I had a healthy concern that the text would be different than what I was used to. Fortunately, this is not an issue at all.</p>
<p>My next area of concern was the translation. I must say that I was thoroughly impressed with the translation as well. It is a combination of beautiful English, devotion to tradition, and appropriate modern adjustments. One novel translation was in the response to the Wicked Son. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> translates this section by saying (emphasis mine) &#8220;&#8230;And by divorcing himself from the community he denies <em>our very essence. </em>Moreover, you must <em>blunt the bite of his words</em>, by telling him&#8230;&#8221; This is not the exact translation that most orthodox Jews would use, but it is true to the text and insightful. A second example of a novel translation is found in &#8220;V&#8217;Hi She&#8217;amda&#8221;. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds a poetic nuance in &#8220;For it was not one alone who stood over us, a heel on our necks, bent on our annihilation&#8230;&#8221; I found that one to be a nice touch. One last thing that stuck out was the adjustment from the oft used &#8220;simple son&#8221; to the &#8220;artless son&#8221;. This is perhaps no better than &#8220;simple&#8221; but &#8220;simple&#8221; horribly simplistic as well. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds one section of text that I had not seen previously. At the time that we fill the &#8220;fifth cup&#8221; and open the door for Shfoch Chamascha, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds a couple of verses from Tanach about Elijah the Prophet. I had not seen that before. It offends me, but only slightly, because the idea that Elijah the Prophet visits us when we open the door for Shfoch Chamascha is of questionable vintage and certainly not universally held. All in all, the text and translations were outstanding.</p>
<p>The most problematic part of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> for orthodox Jews is the &#8220;timeline&#8221;. It is highly academic and may, at times, offend orthodox sensibilities. Further, its focus on secular Jewish accomplishments are of little to no value to most orthodox Jewish Seders. One would be hard pressed to actually find anything that would be called &#8220;kefira&#8221; in the timeline, but I can see it being a source of discomfort for many orthodox Jews. I liked most of it.</p>
<p>As for the commentary, it was a lot better than I expected. The gist of the commentary could best be described as a fresh, relevant commentary. It is heavy on take-away lessons that apply in 2012 and light on rabbinic interpretation. However the rabbis of the Talmud and beyond do make several appearances.</p>
<p>If I had to point to its biggest flaw, I would say that at times it is too irreverent of God. Orthodox Jews will cringe at a few of the essays because they paint a picture of God that is not completely in sync with the contemporary orthodox Jewish views of God and His role in the world.</p>
<p>Still, many of the essays portray excellent ideas written in excellent prose that will surely spur a discussion of the haggadah that is familiar to orthodox Jews. For example, speaking of being &#8220;chosen&#8221;, one essay proclaims &#8220;Chosenness can sometimes feel like loneliness; a burden. Perhaps it is for this reason, the haggadah reminds us that our chosenness is an expression of love and a source for rejoicing.&#8221; Sounds like something an orthodox rabbi would say. Commenting on our statement that &#8220;today we are slaves&#8221; the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> asks the obvious question: But we are not slaves today? And answers that our impoverishment is our inability to do all the good that we want to do in our lives. If I told you that was from R&#8217; Yisrael Salanter, you would believe me. But it is not. It is from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a>. Another insight that sounds like a classic is the proposal that the plague that kills all the firstborns of Egypt is a &#8220;measure for measure&#8221; for the Egyptian decree to drown all the baby boys into the Nile. I am sure that others have said this as well. The point is that the commentary sometimes takes on the persona of the traditional orthodox Jewish commentators. There are other nice little &#8220;vorts&#8221; sprinkled throughout the commentary. Like the parallel between the hiding of the Afikomen and the hiding of Moshe as a baby that led to our salvation.</p>
<p>But there are two other kinds of commentary in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> that are bound to rankle some orthodox Jewish sensibilities. One is justified and the other might not be. There are a very small number of essays that may be objectively problematic. For example, one essay proposes that just like us, sometimes God forgets about people other than Himself. Ouch. But other than that, the irreverence and nonchalant tone about God and the Passover story are rarely objectively offensive, if at all.</p>
<p>The most common form of commentary in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is an anathema to most orthodox Jewish Seders, I think. That is, an attempt to take the lessons of the Seder and apply them to society at large, particularly, with a Tikkun Olam flavor. Personally, I think orthodox Jews should not recoil at the mere mention of Tikkun Olam, but many do. For example, one essay remarks that Shifra and Puah are the first examples of &#8220;civil disobedience&#8221;. This is a great point and definitely something to think about. However, few orthodox Jews will find meaning in spending precious moments at the Seder talking about it. Another essay tells a great story about Palestinian prisoners eating matzah on Passover because that is what they were served and invites questions about prison, the Intifada, and Israel. One humorous comparison pits Elijah the Prophet against Santa Claus. Both &#8220;visit&#8221; homes but Santa is forced to go through the Chimney. We stand up and open the door for Elijah. Again, a great conversation starter, but not the kind of conversation that one would expect at an orthodox Jewish Seder. But then again, maybe it should be. Our Seders are so focused on the past and interpretations from the past. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> has some great ways to bring the discussion into 2012 and that might be a good thing for some orthodox Jewish Seders.</p>
<p>In general, the preference of orthodox Jews is to quote rabbis and Torah scholars at the Seder. But as Maimonides famously said,&#8221;<a href="http://efink.tumblr.com/post/7246029090/maimonides-truth" target="_blank">Hear truth from whoever says it</a>&#8220;, I see nothing wrong with including the thoughts and ideas of a few American Jews who are not rabbis or even orthodox.</p>
<p>My only real critique is that in an attempt to be cool and hip, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> makes you turn the book on its side to read the essays and on its other side to read the timeline. Maybe I just don&#8217;t get it. But it is odd and quite annoying. I don&#8217;t see how it enhances the experience.</p>
<p>The verdict is that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is <em>acceptable</em> for orthodox Jews. It has some things to offer that will undoubtably improve your orthodox Jewish Seder. It has other things that will get ignored, but that may not be for the best. Some parts should be ignored, and that is okay too. I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> for most orthodox Jewish readers. If you want to avoid the most problematic essay skip the one that starts &#8220;God. who supposedly knows everything,&#8221;. Otherwise, to my eyes, the rest of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is completely safe. It may seem strange to discuss some of the things that are in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is wrong or a waste of time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/4sons.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4178" title="4sons" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/4sons-296x300.gif" alt="" width="207" height="210" /></a>One of the more interesting discussions at the Pesach seder is about the four sons. On a night of &#8220;fours&#8221;, the four sons provide much in the way of way debate and conversation. We hear about a wise son, a wicked son, a simple son and son who is incapable of asking a question. None of them are perfect and some are better than others.</p>
<p>At our seder we always discuss the opinion that the simple son is actually the best of the bunch and we also debate the nuances that separate the wise son from the wicked son. Another interesting topic is whether or not the four sons are opposites of one another in any way. Of course we also note the fifth son; the son who is not at the table&#8230;</p>
<p>In many haggados, there are illustrations that portray these 4 different sons. There is a lot to learn about what these sons looked like historically in older haggados. (One haggada portrays the wicked son as a boxer. An older haggada portrays him as a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0059.jpg" target="_blank">cigar smoking, monocle wearing cosmopolitan.</a> Yet <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0055.jpg" target="_blank">another has him as knight</a>.)</p>
<p>This post will focus on some contemporary illustrations of the wicked son.<span id="more-4170"></span></p>
<p>First, we have the classic. This is the haggada I grew up with. The Artscroll Youth Haggadah. Here the wicked son is scowling, wears no head covering, dons the dreaded no-collar T-Shirt and has red hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0056.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4173 aligncenter" title="IMG_0056" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0056-1024x764.jpg" alt="" width="559" height="418" /></a></p>
<p>This next one is from a very confusing haggada by Malchut Judaica. Its pictures are all digitally generated but some are representative of recent times, some represent the shtetl and others, like the picture of the four sons represents a time where wicked Jews were in the military. Interestingly, this NEVER occurred. If one was not saintly, they could not serve in the Jewish army. Maybe this guy was in some other army. Who knows? Either way, how is it that someone in these clothes represents evil? I don&#8217;t know. Oh, and the son who doesn&#8217;t know how to ask is off to the left playing with rocks. (The photo cuts him off.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0057.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4175" title="IMG_0057" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0057-1024x764.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="458" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This next one is hard to figure. It comes from the &#8220;Little Medrash Says Haggadah&#8221;. Apparently, the wicked son wears his newsboy cap off to the side, whistles and carries a lasso on one side and is packing heat on the other side. This kid is definitely trouble. It&#8217;s not the weapons as much as his headgear and highly suspect whistling. It could be this haggadah holds that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedim" target="_blank">whistling brings demons</a> and the wicked son is summoning demons, but I thought we were not concerned with demons anymore. Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0058.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4176" title="IMG_0058" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0058-1024x764.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="458" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, we have my favorite. Rabbi Wein&#8217;s Artrscroll Haggadah (I&#8217;m sure he had nothing to do with the illustrations) has this hilarious portrayal of the wicked son. He has no head covering, spiked hair, a ridiculous wrap around headphones for listening to his discman, a watch, a bracelet and a very suspicious look on his face. Worst of all, he has a DOG! A teeth gnashing dog to boot. (Why is this evil? See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/07/dogs-in-judaism-and-an-apology-to-bill-simmons/">Dogs in Judaism and an Apology to Bill Simmons</a>) This kid is all kinds of trouble.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0060.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4177" title="IMG_0060" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0060-1024x764.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="458" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Is there a lot of social value in trying to understand these choices for portraying the wicked son? Probably not. These choices are likely not made by people of influence, intelligence or sensibility. But there is social utility in critically thinking about these portrayals and whether or not we would make similar judgments about people purely based on these epically thin grounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We do make judgments about people based on their appearance all the time. Appearances are important. But at the risk of looking as silly as these haggados do, we should be very careful about rushing to judgment based purely on external things that are not &#8220;wicked&#8221; per se.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In any case, this is another interesting discussion for your Seder next year&#8230;</p>

You should read that post: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/29/a-heartwarming-story-of-charity/">A Heartwarming Story of Charity</a></p>
<p>In the last few days, we have been preparing for Pesach. Of course that means multiple visits to the local Kosher markets. My wife and I both saw some similar examples of charity over the last few days.<span id="more-4151"></span></p>
<p>While I was at Western Kosher I saw an obviously poor, elderly woman take her full shopping cart to the register. I then saw a chasidic man who was obviously not related to her and seemingly a complete stranger to her, pay for her entire order. It was not a small amount and I wanted to share his generosity with you.</p>
<p>My wife was at La Brea Market and the person ahead of her wanted to pay her bill. (LBM allows customers to set up credit accounts.) The cashier looked up the account and told her her balance was zero. The customer said &#8220;that&#8217;s impossible, my husband just reminded me to pay the account before Pesach&#8221;. The cashier told her &#8220;Well someone paid it. Your balance is zero.&#8221;.</p>
<p>These are acts that we need to publicize. These are acts of Jews who get it. These are Jews whom we are all proud to call our brothers and our sisters.</p>
<p>This Pesach don&#8217;t get caught up in the size of matzah, the flavor of marror, the crumbs behind the couch and forget the basics.</p>
<p>This Pesach, remember those who are needy. This Pesach lend a hand and help someone less fortunate feel a little bit more freedom by alleviating the stress of their bills. This Pesach let us unite and hopefully through that we will merit a new personal and national redemption.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A little while back, Google did a video like this and it has become a sort of meme. It&#8217;s a cute meme. It takes some creativity and usually its pretty good.</p>
<p>Aish.com did a nice job with this story of the Exodus using the same style.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the story being told in a new medium and while remaining basically true to the text of the story.</p>
<p>So kudos to Aish, enjoy the video and enjoy your pre-Pesach preparations!</p>

Too many people are going hungry and there is much we can do to help. Sometimes all we need is a reminder. This excellent video is the perfect reminder.</p>
<p>So in your Passover preparations, remember those who are in need. There is an old Jewish custom called &#8220;Maos Chitim&#8221; to provide our less fortunate brethren with the funds needed to purchase Matza, wine and other seder necessities. Don&#8217;t forget to set aside some charity for those less fortunate this Pesach.</p>
<p>Enjoy the video:<span id="more-3978"></span></p>

We are the custodians of the Shul on the Beach and any chance we have to share the Shul with the public we should!</p>
<p>This year we have had public events on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-photos/" target="_blank">Chanukah</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/15/mishloach-manos-packing-on-the-beach-21410/" target="_blank">Pre-Purim</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/" target="_blank">Purim</a>. We also had several Sundays where we just hang out at the shul welcoming visitors.</p>
<p>Because Sunday was also an Erev Yom Tov (and people are making preparations for the holiday) we did not have a public event for Pesach (stay tuned &#8217;til Sukkos). But I felt it would be wrong not to open the shul doors for at least a little while so I went to the Shul for a couple hours on Sunday.<span id="more-2334"></span></p>
<p>My sister in law came over with Rami and Ozzie and kept and I on them while I gave out Matza and talked to anyone interested in hanging out for a few minutes. I met some very interesting people and took just a few photos which you can enjoy below.</p>
<p>It was a great compliment to a holiday that featured a lot of outreach as some community members hosted Seders for friends and neighbors. One seder had 58! guests and another had well over 30, while others hosted a smaller more intimate groups! I was very impressed with the commitment of those community members to sharing our wonderful traditions with those who may not be so familiar with Pesach and the seder. All I can say is <em>Thank You</em> and <em>Great Job</em>!</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that I took some time to meet and greet people at the Shul on the Beach. We look forward to more events open to the public and more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>To be fair I have had my <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/14/all-about-manners/" target="_blank">share</a> of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/03/irresponsible-journalism-from-the-new-york-times/" target="_blank">criticism</a> of the New York Times. I don&#8217;t call them anti-Semitic though, that just reminds me of Uncle Leo in the <a href="http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheShowerhead.htm" target="_blank">Shower Head</a> Seinfeld episode. Uncle Leo&#8217;s burger is medium instead of rare so he assumes the chef must be an anti-Semite&#8230; That doesn&#8217;t stop <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2005/11/the_new_york_times_and_the_jew.html" target="_blank">these guys from going in that direction</a>. (I found them in a google search result, I have never heard of them before&#8230;) Maybe Unlce Leo writes for the &#8220;American Thinker&#8221;.</p>
<p>And when the NY Times has an article that paints Jews in a positive light I feel equally compelled to raise the issue,<span id="more-440"></span></p>
<p>A few days ago the NY Times <a href="http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">&#8220;Bitten&#8221;</a> blog ran a great article on April 1st / Fools Day, (tongue in cheek I suppose, but one never knows) about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matzo" target="_blank">Matza</a> is just like Pizza &#8211; only better! <a href="http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/is-matzoh-better-than-pizza/?emc=eta1" target="_blank">The article </a>takes a few stabs at the price of Shmura Matza (near $20 a pound) which is a legitimare gripe and gives a decent description of the process by which matza is fashioned and baked.</p>
<p>The line that <em>makes</em> the article is the close.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Shmura matzoh is an authentic product — not the re-creation of one — and authenticity is to be prized, especially when it tastes so good.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Pesach is the most celebrated Jewish holiday. Varioations and modern reincarnations of the Seder are everywhere we turn. I think that the original, authentic Seder is powerful enough and vast enough for years and years of discussion that we don&#8217;t need new versions. The original has plenty to offer us. But at least for everyone the Matza remains authentic. The Matza does not get adulterated.</p>
<p>The Seder reenacts and reminds us how the Jewish tribe became a nation. The Jewish people remain a nation because its precepts and tenets remain viable <em>unchanged</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame that the celebration of the birth of the Jewish people by many Jews would be unrecognizable to those who experienced the very first Seder. The authentic Seder tastes so good &#8211; we don&#8217;t need to change it! There are plenty of ways to bring your creativity to the traditional Seder.</p>
<p>The Matza reminds us all of what a Seder is all about &#8211; authenticity..</p>
