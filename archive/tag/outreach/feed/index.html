				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This essay was written on October 8, 2013. It was never published. I think it&#8217;s still perfectly relevant.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/" target="_blank">The Pew report</a> confirmed what many Jewish people already knew. Non-Orthodox Judaism is in crisis. According to Professor Stephen M. Cohen over 75% of non-Orthodox Jews are intermarried. About 43% of children of intermarriage consider themselves Jewish. The numbers are devastating and religious leaders are scrambling for solutions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, despite doomsday predictions from the 20th century, the Orthodox Jewish data demonstrates strength and viability. Almost 0% of Orthodox Jews intermarry and over 80% of Orthodox Jews between the age of 19 and 29 stay orthodox.</p>
<p>Some people think this is cause for celebrating Orthodox triumph. Other Orthodox Jews think that Orthodox Jews must step up outreach efforts to bring non-Orthodox Jews into the fold of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think there is a third approach.<span id="more-9291"></span></p>
<p>Professor Cohen suggested that <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/editorial-opinion/editorial/losing-our-faith">Orthodox Jews and non-Orthodox increase their social ties</a>. Both groups believe that the other is not interested, but that needs to change.</p>
<p>I agree with Professor Cohen. As it stands right now, Orthodox Jews are enjoined from participating in inter-denominational activities and groups as per a nearly unanimous rabbinic ruling of the generation&#8217;s greatest Torah authorities in the middle of the 20th century. But there is a price to this ruling. The price is very clear boundaries between fellow Jews. Sociologically this has the negative effect of preventing cross-pollination of ideas. Non-orthodox Jews get little access to the vibrancy and beauty of Jewish traditions and practices that are found in Orthodox Judaism.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9293" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/puzzle-pieces-852x500.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="puzzle-pieces-852x500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The context that non-Orthodox Jews have the greatest interaction with Orthodox Jews is <em>&#8220;kiruv.&#8221;</em> But this is not the same as creating social ties that breach the gates of the self imposed ghetto. This is interaction for the purpose of eliciting a specific desired result. I am suggesting interaction for the sake of interaction. Social ties with no strings attached won&#8217;t limit the interactions to potential <em>kiruv</em> candidates and will more likely be institutionally accepted by the non-Orthodox.</p>
<p>A <em>kiruv</em> relationship is one where the Orthodox Jew wants something for the non-Orthodox Jew. But the non-Orthodox Jew may not want the same thing. Even if the non-Orthodox Jew eventually comes to desire the same thing the Orthodox Jew wants, the relationship began as an uneven partnership. The two parties had different goals. The desired outcome is different for each party. The Orthodox  Jew wants the non-Orthodox to adopt an Orthodox lifestyle and the non-Orthodox Jew might simply want a friend. The best relationships are mutually beneficial and are created as balanced partnerships. Both parties have similar goals and aspirations for the relationship. They agree on the hopeful outcome. Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews must create these kinds of social ties. Friendship for the sake of the friendship.</p>
<p>This is aside from the obvious benefit increased intra-denominational activity will have on Jewish unity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2013/10/03/can-liberal-judaism-survive" target="_blank">In an article published by OnFaith</a>, Rabbi David Wolpe suggested that liberal Judaism must embrace rituals in order to survive.<em> &#8220;Wearing Tefillin, praying in Hebrew, Torah study, Kashrut, Jewish communal adherence and activities — these things (while not necessarily limited only to Jews) are activities that keep the core of the tradition alive.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rituals create a common language and uniquely Jewish experiences. Jews with these collective experiences as part of their religious identity will want to perpetuate these rituals in their family lives. This increases the desirability of marrying Jewish. It&#8217;s not simply tribalism or religious mandate. It&#8217;s a self-interested choice to pass on uniquely Jewish experiences to one&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s the point of all these rituals? What benefit is there to the non-Orthodox Jew? This is a question that Orthodox Jews are adequately positioned to answer.</p>
<p>Who better than Orthodox Jews to impart the wisdom of these rituals? What better way is there to demonstrate the value in these rituals than the people who do them on a regular basis? It need not be for the purpose of proselytization. It is simply an opportunity to better appreciate the role of rituals in Judaism.</p>
<p>If non-Orthodox Jews are interested in learning about rituals, the Orthodox Jewish community is uniquely poised to step in and create mutually beneficial relationships with non-Orthodox Jews. Now we can honestly say that we are interested in the same outcome. We have an opportunity to create balanced, even friendships. We all want the same thing. This can stimulate increased social ties between all Jews.</p>
<p>Hopefully, non-Orthodox Jews will heed Rabbi Wolpe&#8217;s call and trend toward adding more traditional rituals to their observance. After all, this is a major key to Jewish continuity.</p>
<p>Even among formerly Orthodox Jews who have made the choice to leave Orthodox Judaism, many find that some rituals are worth perpetuating. Most end up marrying fellow Jews. I suspect that this has a lot to do with common experiences and a bit of nostalgia toward their Judaism. That can be replicated within the non-Orthodox Jewish community as well.</p>
<p>The Orthodox Jewish community cannot afford to let this opportunity slip through its fingers either. It is time we adjust our goals and reach across the aisle for the sake of friendship and <strong>mutually agreed upon goals</strong>.</p>
<p>I ask Orthodox and non-Orthodox rabbis and leaders to consider the price of denominational isolation. I ask my Jewish brethren to consider the price of our failure to communicate to one another. We are all in this together. Let&#8217;s act like it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to inspiration, most Orthodox Jews turn to glorious books of Mussar, or historical legends about our Torah sages, or fiery speeches by modern day orators, or the latest Aish.com inspirational story, or other Torah content that is heavy on encouragement or equally overloaded with deprecation. When it comes to Jewish law, we study Halachic texts. We don’t expect to find inspiration in legal works.</p>
<p>But Halachic text can be inspirational too. For example, Aruch Hashulchan, Orach Chaim §484.</p>
<p>The original text of OC §484<a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Arbaah_Turim.1.484.1" target="_blank">in the Tur</a> and <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.484" target="_blank">Shulchan Aruch</a> dryly discusses the codification of the Rif regarding the procedure for one who is, for some unknown reason, making blessings of the Seder in more than one home. It&#8217;s fairly straightforward and uninteresting. This is standard Talmudic and post-Talmudic legalism. Conjure up an obscure situation and use it as a test case to demonstrate the limits of the law. In this case, the laws that dictate how and where one must eat their Seder meal and perform the Seder rituals. The practical law is not relevant to the point of this article.<span id="more-8318"></span></p>
<p>Interestingly, in his halachic work, R’ Epstein pretty much invents (unless he gets it from another source that I have not been able to find) the circumstances of this quirky law. The <a href="http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/ערוך_השולחן_אורח_חיים_תפד" target="_blank">Aruch Hashulchan, OC §484</a> begins this section with this introduction: <span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><em>&#8220;One who has neighbors who don&#8217;t know how to make the blessings and perform the Seder rituals, and he has no choice but to make a Seder for his neighbors, should perform the Seder on their behalf in the following manner.</em>” </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Later he says, that if the neighbors can’t read Hebrew he should recite the blessings with his neighbors word by word. He references this idea of teaching his neighbors how to do the Seder several times throughout the section. And not just at one home. The law is speaking about an individual who is going from home to home to home in order to help all his neighbors make a proper Seder. Thus, the dry law found in the Tur and Shulchan Aruch is not merely an abstract construction designed to test the limits of the law. In fact, the law is relevant to a very practical and possibly common situation. The chapter is about a Good Samaritan who abandons his own Seder for the sake of his neighbors who don’t know how to do a Seder on their own.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vienna-haggadah-1930-after-xl-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8320" alt="vienna-haggadah-1930-after-xl-2" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vienna-haggadah-1930-after-xl-2.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p>I can’t help but feel a surge of love and pride for R’ Epstein and his imaginary, but surely very real, hero of this section of halacha. This man is incredible. Of course he does his own Seder. And of course he does it well. When he proclaims at his Seder that “All who want to partake may come and join us,” no one comes. But he knows that his neighbors are clueless as to how to make a Seder. He knows that they are not enjoying their own Seders. So he finishes his Seder in a timely manner, leaves the comfort of his home, and gets to work on assisting as many people as he can in the great Mitzvah of reliving the Exodus via the Seder. He is a giant of Jewish spirit.</p>
<p>Late 19th century <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navahrudak" target="_blank">Belarus</a> had many pious, practicing Jews. But apparently, many were apathetic or simply ignorant of the Seder traditions. (Yes, even in the shtetl, there was &#8220;Social Orthodoxy&#8221; and religious greenhorns.) Would these people be able to make a Seder on their own? Certainly not. So would they just miss the entire Seder process? R&#8217; Epstein would not stand for that. It was either assumed that more educated neighbors would obviously be out all Seder night helping their neighbors who needed a Seder, or perhaps R’ Epstein was making an oblique suggestion that people should get out and help their neighbors. It’s a grand view of the role of the practicing Jew and R’ Epstein almost demands that this be our approach to the non-practicing Jew. Reaching out to others is expected.</p>
<p>I was inspired by this chapter of Aruch Hashulchan. I was inspired by the clever reframing of an obscure legalistic exercise into a spectacular practical lesson in caring for our fellow Jew. Fortunately, it seems we have embodied this monumental lesson into our modern Pesach Seders. So many people host Seders with incredibly diverse groups of their Jewish brothers and sisters. The level of education and familiarity with the rituals ranges from expert to novice. But all are included. An emphasis on Jewish education and modern technology gives us all easy access to attaining familiarity with the Seder and its traditions. We can all assist others and help them participate in a Seder.</p>
<p>Let’s do our best to make sure that there is no one who needs to look up the laws of §484 this year. Make sure that everyone has a Seder to attend. There’s also enough time to learn about the Seder in time for Monday night’s big event. All the Jewish people experienced the exodus and tasted freedom together. The Seder belongs to all of us. Take ownership and share the joy of the Seder freely and generously.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2005, I took my group of college students to Israel on an inspirational trip. The format of the trip was study in the mornings and tour the rest of the day. The guys studied at Aish HaTorah and the girls studied at Neve Yerushalayim. Aish provided a basic curriculum and some of their best instructors. But not all the teachers were good and I had promised my students &#8220;the best&#8221; so I poked around and asked if there was anyone that could replace some of the less engaging teachers.</p>
<p>Someone, and I don&#8217;t remember who, pointed to a slight young man who was dressed in semi-hasidic garb and said, this guy might be good, he has no experience teaching here, but he might be what you&#8217;re looking for. I was sold. The next day I introduced Rabbi Daniel Katz to my group and he was an instant favorite. In my subsequent trips to Israel I requested Rabbi Katz and made sure I got at least a few classes with him. Some people thought I was a little crazy because I was replacing world famous teachers with a relatively unknown young rabbi, but I trusted my instincts and persisted. By the time my final trip rolled around, Aish was giving me a hard time about having Rabbi Katz teach my group because he was in such high demand. I reminded them that he got his start with my group and they relented. As always, Rabbi Katz was a hit.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had lunch with Rabbi Katz.<span id="more-8250"></span> It was our first face to face interaction since 2006. We hung out for two hours but we could have gone for hours longer. After all this time, I can confirm that Rabbi Katz is still one my favorite people ever.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sb-speaking.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8253" alt="sb-speaking" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sb-speaking.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>On the surface, we are an odd match. He is very involved in Chassidus and the more mystical kind of Judaism that doesn&#8217;t usually speak to me. I am very involved in Maimoniean Judaism and Halacha. That&#8217;s the kind of Judaism that speaks less to Rabbi Katz. But in so many ways we are saying the same things just using very different language.</p>
<p>More importantly, the things that bother me most about Kabbalistic Mysticism as it practiced today are the same things that bother Rabbi Katz. He is not interested in segulos, the scoreboard in the sky, or purely spiritual benefits of mitzvah observance. His philosophy is very focused on character development and understanding the mind using the wisdom of Chassidus. But it&#8217;s all very hands-on and practical. I like that a lot.</p>
<p>We both have no need or interest in denominations and division among the Jewish people. Rabbi Katz&#8217;s teachings appeal to Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews alike. It&#8217;s not about becoming Orthodox. It is about experiencing an awesome version of Judaism. I try to do the same thing with a different version of Judaism. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s only for Orthodox or non-Orthodox Jews. It&#8217;s just for Jewish Jews and you could even throw some non-Jews into the mix too.</p>
<p>During our talk we shared ideas about outreach and the current state of Orthodox Judaism. We agreed on almost everything but we express it in different ways. I love talking to people who seem different than me and learning or confirming that we have a lot more in common than one might think. Spending a couple of hours with Rabbi Katz was a tease. I am already looking forward to his next visit and our next conversation.</p>
<p>I remember loving Rabbi Katz in 2005, but it was interesting to see that I love him even more in 2014. To me, he is on a beautiful path of Judaism and I think he is providing an invaluable resource by leading powerful seminars on personal growth and character development. His Torah is the kind of Torah that helps us to be better people. He believes there is value in the Jewish experience and we need to provide Jewish experiences to as many people as possible. Most of all, Rabbi Katz believes that Judaism that each person needs to find the version of Orthodox Judaism that works best for them. There is no one true path to the exclusion of the others. Some people might appreciate his version more than mine and vice versa. But in the end, we both see our personal preferences as just that, preferences, and not indications of incontrovertible dogma.</p>
<p>Rabbi Katz does seminars called Elevation Seminars. He teaches people how to address their fears and doubts in an effort to engage in life&#8217;s challenges with one&#8217;s full arsenal of skills and abilities. Elevation Seminars are getting incredible reviews. People are learning, growing, and enjoying the process of learning how to experience life from Rabbi Katz&#8217;s perspective. I don&#8217;t think I would consider attending something like this seminar under normal circumstances. But I feel a kinship with Rabbi Katz and I think I would attend an Elevation Seminar. Certainly if you are someone who would enjoy this kind of thing, find out when Rabbi Katz is going to be in your area. If he&#8217;s not coming yet, bring him to you. If that doesn&#8217;t work out, go to him.</p>
<p>There are some people that you encounter in life that exude dignity, kindness, and wisdom. I meet a lot of people. I can&#8217;t think of the last person that could match Rabbi Katz using those benchmarks. Even if the content was terrible (it&#8217;s not), I think it&#8217;s worth just spending time observing and enjoying the company of a great man like Rabbi Katz. He is the kind of person that I look up to and I hope others start to catch on to his greatness. We need more people like Rabbi Katz.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this is the most unlikely endorsement of Rabbi Katz and his work. Take that as you wish. I am being completely sincere and I was not asked to write any of this. I just had a lovely experience and know that many others might want to explore the idea of trying to have a similar experience. I hope Elevation Seminars become a regular occurrence around the world. I hope that we all find our place within Judaism as Rabbi Katz has and as Rabbi Katz provides for others.</p>
<p>For now, I am happy knowing that Rabbi Katz is reaching people and using his immense talent and charisma to give others tools for living a great life. A life of Elevation.</p>

<p>Parshas Vayishlach begins as Yaakov prepares for an epic encounter with Esav from whom he bought the birthright and snatched the Avrahamic tradition. The psukim tell us that Yaakov devised a three-part plan to survive the meeting with an enraged Esav. Yaakov sends gifts, offers a prayer to G-d and divides his camp into two. In the night, Yaakov takes his family across the Yabov waterway. The verse (32:23) tells us that he took his 2 wives and 11 eleven children over the Yabok.</p>
<p>Rashi wonders why only 11 children crossed the Yabok. Including Dina, Yaakov has 12 children. Rashi quotes the Midrash: “And where was Dina? She was locked in a box so that Esav should not see her. For this, Yaakov was punished. Since he withheld Dina from meeting Esav and perhaps influencing him to repent, Dina fell in the hands of Shechem.”<span id="more-3307"></span></p>
<p>Rav Yaakov Weinberg Of Blessed Memory used this Midrash to emphasize how far one must go to reach out to a brother. Yaakov was wrong for hiding Dina from his brother Esav and he should have at least given Esav the opportunity to repent for the sake of marrying Dina. For failing to give Esav a chance, Yaakov was punished. The lesson is profound. Esav was out for vengeance; he wanted to kill Yaakov. Still, Yaakov should have kept his cool and been optimistic for his brother’s success.</p>
<p>Yaakov is criticized for not wanting to influence Esav in a positive way through marriage. What about Leah? A famous Midrash tells us that Leah cried because she did not want to marry Esav. (This is not universal, Onkeles says her eyes were beautiful.) Shouldn’t Leah have welcomed the opportunity to help Esav turn his life around? The Sifsei Chachamim asks a similar question.</p>
<p>Perhaps the verse alludes to this criticism when the Torah relates the story of Dina and Shechem. The verse says “Vatetze Dina bas Leah”, Dina the daughter of Leah went out. Rashi wonders why she is called Dina the daughter of Leah and not Dina the daughter of Yaakov. Rashi quotes the well-known Midrash and says that Dina learned how to be a “yatzanis”, one who “goes out” from her mother Leah.</p>
<p>Maybe the Torah is also alluding to Leah’s failure to marry Esav. The incident served as Divine retribution for Yaakov hiding Dina in a box in an effort to avoid Esav. He should have been open to the opportunity to spur a transformation in Esav. He was not. He was punished. Leah too, was not open to that opportunity. According to the Midrash she bawled because she did not want to marry Esav. Vatezte Dina bas Leah, Dina the daughter of Leah went out. Leah is not off the hook. Yaakov and Leah both made the same kind of error and the result was Shechem defiling Dina.</p>
<p>How far are we supposed to go when we reach out to others? Very far. Here at The Shul on the Beach we don’t need to go very far. Just look around. Just look outside. Just think about your neighbors.</p>
<p>We all have opportunities to influence others. We can influence by teaching or simply by example. If we avoid those opportunities we may be doing a disservice to our brothers and sisters who look to us for guidance and we may be doing a disservice to ourselves as well.</p>

As we approach the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana, the least we could do was wish the Venice Boardwalk a collective Shana Tova (A Good Year) to all the passersby.</p>
<p>So I set up shop outside the Shul on the Beach on a Sunday afternoon. Literally thousands of people pass the Shul on a beautiful summer Sunday like yesterday. I started all alone, but was eventually joined by Shul Co-President Alan Danziger and veteran of the Venice Boardwalk outreach scene, Rabbi Mintz and as the Klezmer Concert approached (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/30/klezmer-on-the-beach-concert-was-a-great-success/">Klezmer on the Beach Concert Was a Great Success</a>) many, many friends, neighbors and my family. Over the course of the few hours we were there plenty of folks from the local area and as far as Australia, London, Israel (of course) and South Africa stopped by.<span id="more-2777"></span></p>
<p>Everyone was offered some apples and honey to symbolize our wish for a sweet new year and many obliged. We also gave tours of our shul and some even took advantage of the photo opportunity to take one with a rabbi (me). No doubt to show their parents back home &#8220;See I am hanging out with a rabbi in a shul!&#8221;. Of course we also invited them all to come again on the High Holidays if they needed a place to go and even to stop by on a Shabbos for a few moments any time they please.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will be there again this coming Sunday of Labor Day weekend to meet more people and dip even more apples into honey.</p>
<p>We look forward to more events open to the public and much more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

It was Purim and they wanted to take pictures, talk with me and some of our Shul members and join in our Purim Celebration.</p>
<p>Never ones to turn down inviting strangers into the Shul, we welcomed them.</p>
<p>As I wrote at the time, our Purim Celebration was really special as we welcomed anyone and everyone off the boardwalk into our Shul. Read more here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/">Pacific Jewish Center Purim Celebration Recap February 28, 2010</a></p>
<p>Nancy took beautiful candid photos and David kind of blended in with the rest of us<span id="more-2382"></span> talking to us and learning about the Pacific Jewish Center and the festival of Purim.</p>
<p>Purim is a funny time to be introduced to new people. Things are a little different on Purim. But David managed to get to know us in a way that I never thought an outsider could.</p>
<p>Nancy and David produced a wonderful photo-film of their visit. It is part of their Escape Into America Series. The series is incredible. They have managed to find a lot of soul throughout their travels and it really comes through in their work.</p>
<p>In the photo-film about us, they did a really super job cutting through it all and finding the soul of our shul.</p>
<p>There are a couple things in the photo-film that are not perfectly precise, but that&#8217;s okay. (2 minor corrections: 1- I did mention to David that Purim costumes were likely borrowed for the Venice Carnival in the 15th Century and yet costumes fit in well with the themes of the day, 2- I am not sure I actually said that the Shul was in danger of disappearing &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t, rather, it could have been on that path).</p>
<p>Other than a couple minor mistakes the photo-film really captures the essence of Purim in our Shul as well as much of the essence of who we are at Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>The video stars everyone, but Yosef Beithalachmi (aka Mr. Pickles) and Ashi Bersin are featured in the voice-over. Great job!</p>
