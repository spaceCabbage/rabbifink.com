Yom HaShoah has a slogan: Never Forget.
It&#8217;s an odd slogan for a Jewish Holiday. Us Jews, we never forget anything. We have very long memories.

<p>Yom HaShoah has a slogan: Never Forget.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an odd slogan for a Jewish Holiday. Us Jews, we never forget anything. We have very long memories. We don&#8217;t need to say &#8220;Never Forget&#8221; to remember Yom Kippur every year, nor do we need a slogan to remind us to light Chanukah candles or to host a Pesach Seder. We are very good at remembering both the good times and the bad. Indeed, &#8220;Never Forget&#8221; seems superfluous.</p>
<p>But I think I can explain it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never Forget&#8221; is not a slogan for those who are Jewish and won&#8217;t ever forget. The slogan is for everybody else. We are reminding the rest of the world that they cannot forget the Holocaust. We are not reminding them so that they should mourn with us. We can&#8217;t expect that kind of empathy from the rest of the world. We are reminding the world about the Holocaust so that it should never happen again &#8211; to anyone else.<span id="more-6888"></span></p>
<p>We have been through several Holocausts as a people. We can handle it. It&#8217;s painful and it&#8217;s dreadful, but you don&#8217;t stick around for 3500 years by folding after a Holocaust. We will never forget.</p>
<p>But the world is still a violent place. We have been doing better lately, but there is still genocide, there is still hate, there is still institutionalized oppression. The message of Never Forget is that the world can not forget what happens when hate goes unchecked. The world must remember that the good people of the world must stand in the way of the bad people of the world.</p>
<p>Never Forget means that we must do what it takes to eradicate fundamentalist hatred between groups. We must end oppression of weaker, smaller groups. We cannot let anyone be the victim of hate crimes. We are responsible to end all genocide. That is what it means to &#8220;Never Forget&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sharing the harrowing stories of the Holocaust, hearing heroic stories of survival, appreciating the compassion of those who saved us during the Holocaust are vital to the observance of Yom HaShoah. We all play a role in the dissemination of the message of Yom HaShoah. The short game is to experience Yom HaShoah and feel its emotion for ourselves and our families and our communities. The long game is to use our remembrances to further the broader universal goals to guarantee that the world &#8220;Never Forgets&#8221;, to find common ground with one another, and stand against hate.,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been more than 65 years. As a society, we can do a better job to end genocide and hate crimes. It is our responsibility to do a better job. Mass killings in Syria, Sudan, and Myanmar cry out for our attention. Hate crimes throughout the world remindÂ us that there is still much work to do. Today is a day to do something. Yom HaShoah should be noticed by the world, but not simply as a day to remember the pain of the Holocaust. The world should remember with us. &#8220;Never Forget&#8221; how a world can watch as millions of innocent people are slaughtered. If we can successfully impart this message, we can change our future. We can nudge the international community a little closer to a day where the entire world can live in peace and harmony. It takes work and it takes energy to tell our story to the world. But if we can do it the right way we will guarantee that no one else will ever need a day to say &#8220;Never Forget&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2352" title="Holocaust Remembrance" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image-300x272.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="190" /></a>Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah" target="_blank">Yom Hashoah</a>. It is a day designated to Holocaust Remembrance. In the spirit of this special day I would like to share a story with you.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/" target="_blank">Cross-Currents</a>, <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/04/09/the-song-was-true/" target="_blank">Rabbi Adlerstein has linked</a> to a very powerful article in the Detroit News.</p>
<p>Most Orthodox Jews have heard the song called &#8220;The Man From Vilna&#8221; by Abie Rottenberg. It tells a powerful story in post liberation Europe. <span id="more-2349"></span>It was the day of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simchat_Torah" target="_blank">Simchas Torah</a>, a grand celebration at the completion of the weekly Torah readings. Typically, the day is marked by feverish dancing and rejoicing for hours while holding the Sefer Torah Scroll. However, on this dark day the synagogue in Vilna had no Sefer Torah. They had been destroyed by the Nazis.</p>
<p>A Jewish Russian soldier spotted a young boy. This was an anomoly as most young children were killed in the holocaust. But this boy was hidden in a convent during the war and had survived. The soldier scooped up the boy and danced with the boy as if he were the Sefer Torah Scroll. His act symbolized to all that although the physical Torah Scrolls were destroyed and Six Million Jews had been killed, the Torah and Judaism live on through the next generation of children.</p>
<p>After that moment, they never saw each other again.</p>
<p>Until last week.</p>
<p>They finally met for the first time in 65 years. They both remembered that incredible day and that poignant moment all this time. It was a very emotional reunion.</p>
<p>Like many great stories, people thought of this as a legend, with perhaps some basis in reality. But these two men confirmed its veracity. It also identifies the two men as prominent Jewish leaders. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Foxman" target="_blank">Abe Foxman </a>was the boy and he is the New York based director of Anti-Defamation league and Leo Grossman, was the soldier and became the Rabbi of Shaarey Shamayim Synagogue in Oak Park Michigan. Their story and inspiration became inspiration for others as well as action in their lives for others.</p>
<p>I recommend reading the <a href="http://detnews.com/article/20100409/OPINION03/4090372" target="_blank">article in the Detroit News</a>.</p>
<p>Someone has taken the song and made a homemade music video. I have included the video below:</p>
