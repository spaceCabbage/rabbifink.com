				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sadducees.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7040" alt="sadducees" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sadducees-264x300.jpg" width="264" height="300" /></a>It is a commonly held belief in the orthodox Jewish community that the Sadducees and the Karaites are basically the same thing. The Sadducees, along with other sectarians, challenged the Pharisees and their interpretations of the Written Torah.</p>
<p>However, as I hope to explore a bit in a post sometime soon, they had their own Oral Traditions and methodology. It was a close cousin to the Pharisees and they did not disagree on all that much nor was there a very wide berth separating the groups. There was even some cross-pollination and we will see in that future post.</p>
<p>The Karaites came on the scene 800 years later. The Sadducees were long gone and the only group that was left standing from the tumultuous Second Temple Period were the Pharisees. While in some small ways, one can trace Karaite theology to some aspects of sectarian Second Temple movements, there was likely no continued, unbroken chain connected them to sectarians.</p>
<p><span id="more-7038"></span></p>
<p>This has been debated in academic circles for a while now and I don&#8217;t intend on resolving the debate in this post although I lean toward the side that says that Karaites started from scratch in the 9th century as a response to Islam.</p>
<p>Either way, it has become accepted wisdom in orthodox Judaism that Karaites are very similar to Sadducees and the terms are used interchangebly. I may have found an early source for this confusion. In his commentary on the Mishna in Avos, Maimonides says that Antignos Ish Socho taught that we should not do Mitzvos in anticipation of reward. Maimonides quotes the Avos D&#8217;Rabbi Nosson and writes that Tzadok and Bytus took this to mean that there is no reward in the next world and thereby launched their respective sectarian groups of the Sadducees (Tzadokim) and Boethusians (Bytusim). Maimonides continues and says that these groups survived to this very day (12th century) and are now called Karaites.</p>
<p>It seems that Maimonides lumps them together. This might be a mistake or just a clumsy way of grouping similar groups together. In truth, they are not so similar. Karaites would reject the Sadducee interpretations of the Torah as much as they would deny the truth of Pharisee interpretations. It&#8217;s imprecise to lump them together in an academic sense. Perhaps it makes sense to lump them together in a religious sense.</p>
<p>I think that this note by Maimonides could be one of the reasons rabbinic orthodox Judaism now fails to distinguish between the two groups. I would prefer precision for the sake of accuracy and truth. But more importantly, there is a lot we can learn about contemporary Judaism by looking at these groups and we can only even begin to do this if we have our terminology correct. Now that we do, I hope to continue exploring the relationship between the Pharisees and Sadducees in my next post on this topic. Hopefully tomorrow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6615" alt="menorah-temple" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/menorah-temple-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" />One of the anomalies of Chanukah is that we have historical and apocryphal texts along with rabbinic texts. We have a pretty reliable idea of what life was like when the Chanukah story took place. I think the context of the story sheds light on the far reaching consequences of the Chanukah story.</p>
<p>The Seleucid-Greeks were involved in a three way civil war. They thought conquering Israel would solve their problems by giving them a port in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile Greeks were integrating into the culture of the Land of Israel. This relationship started off amicably. The Septuagint was published. Greek / Jewish relations seemed okay. The two cultures shared some impressive characteristics. They both valued wisdom and scholarship as opposed to brute force. The Rabbis even considered Greek a sub-Hebrew language in the rank of languages. There was a legal system that was older and just as comperehensive as the Greek system.</p>
<p>On one hand the Greeks would be able to find much in common with Jewish people. On the other hand, there was no “need” for the Greeks to modernize the Jews. They weren’t a savage tribe that needs laws and philosophy to teach them how to live. Greek and Jews could live together so long as there was no attempt by one or the other to assert their will above the other. Many Jews adopted Greek culture into their lives. Some went too far and became Greeks or Hellenists. Other were religious, law abiding Jews who were acculturated.</p>
<p>At the same time that this is happening, a schism is forming within Judaism. The Pharisees were the traditionalists. They believed that the Oral Tradition was Divine and binding. They were heavily representative of rabbis and members of the priestly class. A non-rabbinic group was in its nascent stages and they called themselves the Sadducees. They rejected the Oral Law and rabbinic authority. The Sadducees saw a natural ally in the Greeks and the Hellenized Jews. They recruited the Greeks and Hellenized Jews to their cause. They were a good fit because the Hellenists were less traditional than the Pharisees and the Sadducees rejected tradition.<span id="more-6614"></span></p>
<p>Eventually the Hellenists and Sadducees enlist the Greeks to help their cause. The Seleucid King Antiochus is happy to oblige and he begins a reign of terror over the Jewish people. He forbade celebrating Jewish holidays, Torah study, and circumcision. The Pharisaic Jews resist these laws. The hand of the Greeks comes fast and heavy.</p>
<p>First there were passive rebels. They ignored the decrees and were mercilessly slaughtered. A war was not ideal because it would kill Hellenist Jews as well as Greek intruders. But in the end there was no choice. The Hasmoneans led a spirited rebellion and after 25 years of war eventually vanquished the Greeks. After just 3 years of fighting, Jerusalem is reconquered and the Hasmoneans rededicated the Temple and in a great symbolic and moral victory they lit the Menorah. The next year they instituted an eight day celebration that we are in the midst of celebrating right now.</p>
<p>This is the start of the Hasmonean dynasty. It lasts 103 years and ends tragically with zero Jews remaining from their line. Worse, another civil war that could be blamed on the Hasmoneans invites the Romans into Israel and eventually the Romans destroy the Temple and exile the Jewish people in one of the most horrific genocides in our history.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years later, the Talmud wants to distract us from the military victory because of the corruption it caused. The rabbis frowned upon the Hasmoneans. They focus on the miracle of the oil. The heretofore-unmentioned miracle of the oil. It is not mentioned in Maccabees or Josephus. The Braisa in Shabbos tells us about the miracle for the first time. Clearly, the rabbis of the Talmud were distracting the attention of the holiday from the victory of the war to the miracle of the oil.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There can be many answers to this question. I propose the following possibility. Maybe the rabbis shifted the focus to the oil to remind us that the Hasmoneans were not exemplars of what the Torah really wants from us.</p>
<p>The Ramban says that the Hasmoneans were doomed because they usurped the Jewish monarchy and were also the Priests. They had all the power and the honor. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. But what was their fatal flaw? Why did they mess up so badly? Why didn&#8217;t they restore the Davidic monarchy? Why did they insist on keeping all the power?</p>
<p>I believe their flaw was a failure to properly adjust to modernity. They rejected everything Greek. They sought to completely remove the Greek influence from Israel. This exacerbated the rift between them and the Saducees and Hellenists. This caused those groups to enlist the Greeks. This caused a war. The Hasmonean led Pharisees were unyielding. They would not rest until their brethren completely rejected anything but their stringent beliefs. But the irony is that their fundamentalism worked for a little while. They did liberate the Temple. They did restore Jewish sovereignty to Israel.</p>
<p>But their ultimate downfall was because of a failure to address modernity. They had no approach to Greek culture. It was all or nothing. This was a recipe for short-lived success but eventual disaster. In the end the Hasmoneans were only able to reject or fully embrace the Greek culture. The Hasmoneans wound up as assimilated as one can possibly be. They had no approach to deal with modernity and they failed it.</p>
<p>The rabbis of the Talmud <em>did</em> have an approach to deal with modernity. They were Torah scholars but were well versed in the science and philosophy of their day. The rabbis were not &#8220;all or nothing&#8221;. The rabbis of the Talmud were willing to explore the wisdom that came from outside the Torah. The rabbis wanted us to realize the mistake of the Hasmoneans and focused on the oil, which was not really as important as the victory in the war. But the oil story has staying power. As we are taught, the Menorah in the Temple had 7 lamps and the three lamps on either side represented the wisdom of the world turning toward the center of Torah. That lesson is a lesson taught by the rabbis of the Talmud. The Hasmoneans could not relate to that idea.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, the oil teaches us another thing. Fire is the fusion of spiritual and physical. It is physical but it is used to symbolize the spiritual. We light candles for the souls of our loved ones. Fire is a nexus between the physical and spiritual worlds. The miracle of the oil part of the story makes Chanukah about the using of military might and newfound autonomy for service of God. We are being told that the Hasmonean way is not to revered or emulated. The fire and oil remind us to integrate the world with Torah. This was a message the rabbis could endorse.</p>
