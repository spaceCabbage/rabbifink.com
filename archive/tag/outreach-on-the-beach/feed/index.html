				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RH-2012-Card.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6214" title="RH 2012 Card" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RH-2012-Card-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>In what has become a bit of a custom for me, I took to the Venice Boardwalk on Sunday to wish everyone a sweet new year. As usual, I met some very interesting and wonderful people through the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Many people stopped by to dip the apple in the honey which is not as easy as it looks with the nice ocean breeze wreaking havoc with honey drips. Some stepped into the shul for a few moments and we had some lovely conversations. Everyone got free apples and honey and an open invitation to join us at the Shul on the Beach for High Holidays services.</p>
<p>Of all the people that stopped by, three were of particular interest.<span id="more-6213"></span></p>
<p>One guy was an Iranian Muslim. He said his father was very religious and used to pray his morning services for three hours. It only takes a few minutes for most people, but his father was so pious that it took him hours. Then he told me the entire story of Muhammad. He said his father had great respect for Jewish people and used to study the Torah. This fellow is not Muslim. He claims he is &#8220;everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then there was the film student from Boston. She recently came to LA as part of a program with Boston University. Earlier that day her mother was guilting her about where she was going to go to hear the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah. So she told her mom she didn&#8217;t know yet, but she was definitely going to services &#8220;on the beach&#8221;. She had never even heard of shul but when she saw the shul she said it was &#8220;<em>beshert</em>&#8220;! Now she is planning on joining us for services. Her mother will be happy.</p>
<p>My third encounter was with an Intactvist across the way. He gets his own post. Tune in tomorrow for my conversation with the Venice Boardwalk Intactivist.</p>
<p>The High Holidays are a magical time everywhere. But at The Shul on the Beach they are particularly inspiring. Jews from every walk of life, with every level of observance, and of every background join together for services. Everyone is welcome and everyone is made to feel welcome. We invite you to join us.</p>
<p><strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> is September 16 at sundown through nightfall on September 18. Shofar blowing at The Shul on the Beach will be around 11 AM on September 17 and 18.</p>
<p><strong>Yom Kippur</strong> is September 25 at sundown for K0l Nidre through nightfall on September 26.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to join us for services whether for the entire thing or just a few moments. If you want a seat with your name on it, call or email the PJC office at info@pjcenter.com.</p>

The party featured delicious Chanukah foods and treats, dreidel contests, a moon bounce for the kids, entertainment for everyone courtesy of Derek the Mime a speech from the rabbi and most of all, lovely company.</p>
<p>As usual, the party was open to the Pacific Jewish Center community and to the public as part of our Outreach on the Beach programming. The community was well represented with an excellent showing at the party. With our doors wide open at on Venice Boardwalk we also met and made many old and new friends. People who had been in the shul before returned this afternoon. One woman had been in the shul in the 50&#8242;s and had not been back since. Others were old friends who were part of our community for many years before moving on. It was so nice to see them all. We also met many new people. Some were local Jewish residents who had just never had a chance to come to shul and others were travelers and tourists, some Jewish and some not at all.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful afternoon. We thank everyone who came and who contributed to the festive and celebratory atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you missed the party, you can listen to my speech here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/25/chanukah-2011-address-what-doomed-the-hasmoneans/" target="_blank">What Doomed the Hasmoneans?</a></p>
<p>And you can feel like you were there by watching the slide show below. Hopefully, next time you will be there in person.<span id="more-4983"></span></p>

More specifically, I offered passersby the opportunity to dip an apple in honey as is traditionally done for a sweet new year.</p>
<p>We got plenty of customers who appreciated the reminder that Rosh Hashana was around the corner. Many also appreciated stippling into our historic shul for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Everyone was also invite to join us for services to hear the Shofar blasts and experience some of our High Holiday traditions and services. Hopefully some will take us up on the offer&#8230;</p>
<p>Special thanks to <strong>Yossie Ziff </strong>and <strong>Alan Danziger</strong> for keeping me company and helping out.</p>
<p>Here are some photos from our afternoon:<span id="more-4648"></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/wine.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4117" title="wine" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/wine.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300" /></a>In preparation for Pesach we held a wine tasting event at the Shul on the Beach.</p>
<p>The event was well attended and well received. Guests were treated to an exquisite spread of cheese, fruit, crackers and other tasty appetizers. Of course the stars of the event were the wines.</p>
<p>The wines at the tasting were four new kosher wines being sold at local Trader Joe&#8217;s locations. The wines are ridiculously affordable when compared with the usual cost of kosher wine. They range from $4.99 to $6.99 and they are quite good.</p>
<p>I want to thank <strong>Leslie Friedman</strong> from the PJC office for making the arrangements for the event and to my wife <strong>Tova</strong> for preparing the food and decor so beautifully.<span id="more-4115"></span></p>
<p>I spoke for a few moments about the importance of wine We were treated to a presentation by <strong>Scott Widitor</strong> who talked for a few minutes about the wines and implored us to talk to our local Trader Joe&#8217;s about stocking these wines ore regularly. Also, it&#8217;s important to spread the word about these kosher wines being available at Trader Joe&#8217;s as they are not specially marked and the kosher symbol is on the back.</p>
<p>So look for Shimshon Weiner wines: Terrenal Tempranillo, Terrenal Cabernet Sauvignon, N.V. Sara Bee Moscato and Terrenal Chardonnay at your local Trader Joe&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The wines are pretty good and a super value. If we don&#8217;t ask Trader Joe&#8217;s to stock them, they won&#8217;t. It would be a shame if these wines came off the market.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who showed up for the event and we look forward to our next Sunday Outreach on the Beach event.</p>
<p>Enjoy the photos below.</p>

<p>As the ambassadors of Judaism on the Venice Beach boardwalk, we are charged with the resonsibility and opportunity to provide a Jewish experience to the myriad of Jews and non-Jews who pass our shul on a daily basis.</p>
<p>To that end, we provided an open house Chanukah party. Many passers-by came inside to partake in the spiritual and physical warmth of our shul and its members. Our community made a kiddush Hashem and I am proud of our Chanukah party.</p>
<p>Special kudos<span id="more-3430"></span> are in order for <strong>Jeff Liss</strong> who organized the entire shebang and to <strong>Rabbi Mintz</strong> for manning the doors of the Shul and inviting anyone who was interested into the shul. Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Josh Blum</strong> snatched my camera as soon as I walked into the shul. The pictures that tell the story of our Chanukah party are his and we appreciate his talents (as well as being an integral member of the community) thanks Josh!</p>
<p>I also want to thank everyone who came to the party and participated in the festivities. Your presence was noted and appreciated.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4940039507_f479ee509d.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2778" title="Pacific Jewish Center The Shul on the Beach" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4940039507_f479ee509d-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>At Pacific Jewish Center we endeavor to share the light Judaism with the entire Beach Community. As we approach the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana, the least we could do was wish the Venice Boardwalk a collective Shana Tova (A Good Year) to all the passersby.</p>
<p>So I set up shop outside the Shul on the Beach on a Sunday afternoon. Literally thousands of people pass the Shul on a beautiful summer Sunday like yesterday. I started all alone, but was eventually joined by Shul Co-President Alan Danziger and veteran of the Venice Boardwalk outreach scene, Rabbi Mintz and as the Klezmer Concert approached (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/30/klezmer-on-the-beach-concert-was-a-great-success/">Klezmer on the Beach Concert Was a Great Success</a>) many, many friends, neighbors and my family. Over the course of the few hours we were there plenty of folks from the local area and as far as Australia, London, Israel (of course) and South Africa stopped by.<span id="more-2777"></span></p>
<p>Everyone was offered some apples and honey to symbolize our wish for a sweet new year and many obliged. We also gave tours of our shul and some even took advantage of the photo opportunity to take one with a rabbi (me). No doubt to show their parents back home &#8220;See I am hanging out with a rabbi in a shul!&#8221;. Of course we also invited them all to come again on the High Holidays if they needed a place to go and even to stop by on a Shabbos for a few moments any time they please.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will be there again this coming Sunday of Labor Day weekend to meet more people and dip even more apples into honey.</p>
<p>We look forward to more events open to the public and much more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

We are the custodians of the Shul on the Beach and any chance we have to share the Shul with the public we should!</p>
<p>This year we have had public events on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-photos/" target="_blank">Chanukah</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/15/mishloach-manos-packing-on-the-beach-21410/" target="_blank">Pre-Purim</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/" target="_blank">Purim</a>. We also had several Sundays where we just hang out at the shul welcoming visitors.</p>
<p>Because Sunday was also an Erev Yom Tov (and people are making preparations for the holiday) we did not have a public event for Pesach (stay tuned &#8217;til Sukkos). But I felt it would be wrong not to open the shul doors for at least a little while so I went to the Shul for a couple hours on Sunday.<span id="more-2334"></span></p>
<p>My sister in law came over with Rami and Ozzie and kept and I on them while I gave out Matza and talked to anyone interested in hanging out for a few minutes. I met some very interesting people and took just a few photos which you can enjoy below.</p>
<p>It was a great compliment to a holiday that featured a lot of outreach as some community members hosted Seders for friends and neighbors. One seder had 58! guests and another had well over 30, while others hosted a smaller more intimate groups! I was very impressed with the commitment of those community members to sharing our wonderful traditions with those who may not be so familiar with Pesach and the seder. All I can say is <em>Thank You</em> and <em>Great Job</em>!</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that I took some time to meet and greet people at the Shul on the Beach. We look forward to more events open to the public and more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1868" href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-photos/menorah/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1868" title="menorah" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/menorah-300x259.jpg" alt="menorah" width="180" height="155" /></a>The 2009 PJC Chanukah Party was a tremendous success.</p>
<p>As the Shul on the Beach, a community institution, we are charged with the responsibility and opportunity to bring Judaism to the boardwalk. Our Chanukah party, the first in a series of events and programs designed to reach that end was incredible.</p>
<p>Thank yous are in order to Jeff Liss for organizing, planning and executing the whole thing. Thank you so much. Many others contributed as well and for that we express our appreciation to you as well.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing how many people came through our doors today,<span id="more-1866"></span>but it was a very large number. Rabbi Mintz was particularly effective at luring passers by into the shul. Thank you so much! The shul was packed with community members as well as many passers-by ranging from observant friends to completely unaffiliated Jews as well as many curious non-Jews.</p>
<p>I had the fortune of meeting some wonderful people. Like the father of an adorable daughter whose expectant wife was home. He thought a Chanukah Party would be the perfect way for this non-Jewish father to celebrate with his Jewish daughter. He noted, that as soon as possible, he will be bringing his wife and, God-willing, twin daughters, when mom and babies are up and about. He cited the generosity and friendliness of the community members as impressive.</p>
<p>I met people from all over Los Angeles. Locals, from Santa Monica and Venice. From all over Los Angeles from as far as the Valley to Marina del Rey. I met visitors from Chicago, New Jersey, Miami, Israel and the UK. It was truly a universal Chanukah celebration.</p>
<p>Once inside everyone was treated to warm hospitality, friendliness and traditional Chanukah foods. (Of course there was food.) Towards the end of the party I spoke to the remaining crowd and the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-address/" target="_blank">audio has been posted here</a>.</p>
<p>Our very talented Office Manager, Leslie Friedman took a lot of great photos. You can see them in a slideshow below. If you spot yourself leave us a comment and say hi!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday was the launch of a new initiative at Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>First, some matters of introduction.</p>
<p>We are blessed with an incredible location for our Shul.</p>
<p>Our Shul is on the Venice Beach Boardwalk. With thousands of tourists and locals walking along the boardwalk every week, it is a great spot to meet and greet Jewish people from all over the world.</p>
<p>The Shul is on such a perfect spot for meeting new people it would almost be criminal <em>not</em> to be there on Sundays!</p>
<p>This Sunday<span id="more-772"></span> we began our &#8220;Outreach on the Beach&#8221; initiative. I was there for most of the afternoon and we had a chance to meet many interesting folks from Los Angeles and around the world.</p>
<p>I met an Iranian Jewish couple. We spoke for a little while and they confirmed what <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/10/where-is-the-outrage-the-plight-of-middle-eastern-jewry/" target="_blank">I wrote about last week related to the treatment of Mid-Eastern Jews outside of Israel</a>.</p>
<p>I also met a South African Jew whose son had his Bar Mitzva at our Shul 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Then I met a Hollywood stunt man who wants his son to have his Bar Mitzva and maybe even in our Shul.</p>
<p>Later I met a wonderful woman whose son lives in Venice and is a very well known attorney.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the afternoon I met two friends who were originally from Holland. One now lives in Los Angeles and the other is still living just outside Amsterdam.</p>
<p>This was just a sample of some of the great people we met and I have included some photos that we took at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun and I hope that over the summer we will meet many more Jewish people from around the world.</p>
