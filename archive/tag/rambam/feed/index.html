				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/please-g-d-i-dont-want-a-3rd-temple-a-radical-prayer-from-a-humble-servant/" target="_blank">A recent editorial</a>, written in the style of a letter to God, challenged the notion of animal sacrifices in the Third Temple during the Messianic era. A lot of people were understandably upset by the article. I will not refute or rebut the arguments made against the author and his provocative words. I think a discussion about these issues is valuable and I encourage people to have this conversation.</p>
<p>There are two things that I want to say about the controversy.<span id="more-9099"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame that the uproar over the article, its format, its perceived hubris, and its theological basis has eclipsed its substance, because the substance is so important. <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9100" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Brazen-altar.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Brazen-altar" data-recalc-dims="1" />For about 1400 years, animal sacrifice was a daily part of Jewish life. Some animals were eaten by the Temple staff and penitent pilgrims, but most of the animals were completely burnt on the altar. From the time of the construction of the Tabernacle in the desert until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE Jerusalem, our ancestors sacrificed animals as per the Torah&#8217;s Divine command. The practice was banned outside the Temple and thus we have collectively prayed and yearned for the return of our Temple and ritual sacrifice.</p>
<p>Many of our communal aspirations and prayers were established nearly 2000 years ago in the wake of our Temple&#8217;s destruction. It&#8217;s understandable that rebuilding the Temple and institutionalizing our national Messianic ambitions are prominent themes in our prayers, because that was the dominant feeling of their era. Persecution and the Diaspora experience have reinforced our desire for autonomy, freedom, and redemption. These feelings are also reflected in the prayers that have been added to our service in the centuries that followed our exile.</p>
<p>Animal sacrifice was normal 2000 years ago, and our prayers matched our society. A lot of time has passed since 70 CE. In the meantime, animal sacrifice has gone out of style in the civilized world. There is not a single advanced country where animal sacrifice is part of the daily routine. It survives in a few cults, tribal religions, and indigenous populations. Other than that, it&#8217;s gone. So it would be really weird and quite uncomfortable for many of us to simply resume a long discarded practice that once seemed moral and virtuous and now seems immoral and primitive.</p>
<p>When we ask God to bring the Messiah and the Third Temple and give us the opportunity to offer sacrifices, do we really mean it?</p>
<p>Generally, I have encountered three approaches to this question. 1. God commands it, ergo it must be moral. If you disagree, it&#8217;s a flaw in your faith or character. 2. The world will be so incredibly different in the Messianic era that although it seems weird today, it won&#8217;t seem weird after the Messiah changes everything forever. 3. Something about mysticism involving lots of thumb-dips and fancy terminology.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the truth: We have no idea what is going to happen, but feeling uncomfortable is completely legitimate and reasonable. You <em>should</em> be troubled at the prospect of taking animals and incinerating them for a non-anthropomorphic God&#8217;s pleasure. Indeed, it boggles our minds, and that is okay.</p>
<p>I wish <em>that</em> was the conversation we were having about animal sacrifices right now. What Rav Kook or the Rambam held or would hold is interesting in theory. But I want to talk about actual factual feelings. How do animal sacrifices make you feel?</p>
<p>This leads me to the other aspect of the &#8220;letter&#8221; that is important to me. We have to be okay with acknowledging that animal sacrifice gives many of us the heebie-jeebies. The absence of a satisfactory answer does not obviate the question, and it is far better to have an unanswered question than the appearance of confidence in an answer that is merely a mirage.</p>
<p>The questions raised in this conversation are tough to answer. We know our Holy Torah tells us that God commands animal sacrifices, we know that this is an anathema to 2015 thinking, and we have no reason to think that 2015 thinking about animal sacrifice is immoral or incorrect. Yet the Torah obligates us. It&#8217;s an infinite loop of truths that cannot be easily reconciled. There&#8217;s a temptation to ignore the tugging at our hearts on this issue, and others. But that would not be honest, and it would not give us the opportunity to embrace the struggle of reconciling Torah and modernity.</p>
<p>Too often, we sweep tough questions under the rug. After a while, the pile of confusion under the rug forms a noticeable bump that the rug can&#8217;t hide. If we ask the questions, acknowledge the challenges, and validate the ones raising issues, our rug stays nice and flat. It&#8217;s a comfortable place to sit, or perhaps even fly, as we ponder and contemplate the difficult questions. Let&#8217;s be honest with ourselves. Let&#8217;s be honest with each other. Let&#8217;s be comfortable with questions even without good answers.</p>
<p>Animal sacrifices in the Third Temple? It&#8217;s not the topic to pen a prayer to God for help in understanding. It&#8217;s something for us to respectfully analyze and discuss together. Be present in the struggle. Putting it on God is the easy way out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term Rationalist Judaism has been clanking around the Internet and Orthodox Jewish conversation for a while now. It’s not quite a movement, but there are some very strong contemporary voices behind Rationalist Judaism. Many people think the term is an oxymoron. Others think it is intellectually dishonest. Yet others think it is heresy. But without a working definition or at least a framework to understand what we are talking about, any conversation about Rationalist Judaism will result in people talking past one another and miscommunication.<span id="more-7938"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7939" alt="Thinking-Man-Rodin" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>First, to address the complaint that calling one brand of Judaism “Rationalist” is insulting or offensive to everyone else. It sure seems like the term is implying that everyone else is irrational. This is not the correct implication. Rationalist Judaism is not to the exclusion of irrationality. Instead it is to exclusion of supernaturalism. That’s not to say that mysticism is inherently irrational either. Maybe it is for some. These are just the words that are used to describe two different approaches to God and Judaism. Words are often cumbersome and imprecise. That is the case here. We don’t mean to say Rationalist Judaism is rational and everyone else is irrational.</p>
<p>In general, rationalism literally means to use reason above all else. In this view, truth can be deduced and is not subject to fallacies like appeals to authority or <em>argumentum ad populum</em>. Obviously, a religious person maintains some belief in authority and relies on some subjective baseline truths that cannot be logically argued. But we are not talking about pure rationalism. We are talking about Rationalist Judaism.</p>
<p>I believe that term Rationalist Judaism was adapted from the term Theistic Rationalism. Both groups share some common principles. The basic idea of both groups is to release theology from supernaturalism and focus on morality. To the extent that supernaturalism can be justifiably removed from religion, Rationalist Judaism holds it should be removed. That is all Rationalist Judaism really means.</p>
<p>There are several heroes and champions of this concept, none greater than Rambam. In his halachic and philosophical works, Rambam sought to eliminate superstition, mysticism, and supernaturalism from Judaism to the greatest extent possible. One overriding theme of his works is that there is nothing supernatural other than God. Giving power to charms, incantations, or even angels is akin to idol worship. He held that belief in God was logical. He held that prophecy was a natural result of perfection. He held that God rarely intervenes with nature. He held that <em>Mitzvos</em> have material benefits for the person who performs the Mitzvah. He held that astrology was bunk. He held that God conformed the Torah to the needs of mankind. He held that <em>Maaseh Breishis</em> was science. He held that <em>Maaseh </em><em>Merkava</em>h was metaphysics. There is not a single mystical idea mentioned in any of his books. It’s as if there is no such thing as mysticism in Rambam’s universe.</p>
<p>Some have tried to argue that Rambam was a mystic and obscured his true views. This has been thoroughly debunked by many great scholars and if you are of this mind, I direct you to this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158" target="_blank">Maimonides’ Confrontation with Mysticism</a></p>
<p>There are many other examples of great Torah authorities who used similar principles in their halachic, or philosophical, or exegetical works. R’ Samson Raphael Hirsch wrote Horeb, a book of the philosophy of <em>mitzvos</em> without a single kabbalistic reference. The entire book makes sense of Torah Judaism and it all works even if one rejects mysticism.</p>
<p>Ralbag is another. His commentary on Chumash literally reinterprets examples of supernatural events into metaphors or visions instead of real life occurrences. His worldview fit this same broad category. To the extent that supernaturalism could be excised from Torah and Judaism, he saw to it that they were.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Rationalist Judaism. It’s a tradition that has a long and powerful chain of great Torah luminaries who lived by this philosophy.</p>
<p>Another important element of Rationalist Judaism is that because God’s intervention and communication with man is so limited, the Mesorah and Holy texts of Judaism are more subject to error than one who believes that God ensures the truth of everything. In the opposing view, God’s essence permeates the writings of men like the great Talmudic scholars known as Chazal. Thus, their writings are presumed to be free of mistakes or misjudgments. Rationalist Judaism holds that the best efforts of man can still result in error. This is especially true in matters that are not Torah specific. We refer here to math, science, history, medicine, and other disciplines not directly related to Torah. However, even if Chazal were to err in issues of halacha or Torah specific interpretation, it would not matter as they have the authority to establish the laws for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>It’s true that this sort of thinking led many people to conclusions that we would reject today. Rambam himself was of the belief that God’s existence is provable. Rambam also thought Aristotelian philosophy and science were as true as God’s word in the Torah. We know that both of these are actually untrue. Does this mean that Rationalist Judaism is wrong? Of course not.</p>
<p>In fact, only someone whose paradigm is that Torah authorities are infallible would argue that by disproving Aristotle the entire worldview of Rambam is incorrect. But the paradigm of Rationalist Judaism does not allow for this sort of thinking. People do err, only God is infallible. So Rambam dealt with truth in the same way Chazal dealt with truth. That is, they were subject to the thinking and common beliefs of their time. We are also subject to the thinking and common beliefs of our time. Therefore, we are also supposed to look at Torah through the prism of modern thinking. No one actually pretends that Rambam was a Modern Orthodox Jew of 2013 America. But his worldview is one that allows, or even requires, using contemporary thinking to build one’s Jewish life. That’s what Chazal did and that is what Rambam did and that is what we are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Rambam is not making the claim that Chazal and the prophets before them lived and believed the same way he believed. Rather he is making the argument that with the same information available to Rambam they would have drawn the same conclusions as Rambam. Further, he demonstrates that so much of what they did say is compatible with his Aristotelian, Islamic influenced philosophy. However, even if they would have not reached the same conclusions, they would have used all the available information and evidence to formulate their views. That is what Rationalist Judaism attempts to do as it has always attempted to do.</p>
<p>But what’s the point of all this? Isn’t it obvious that there are supernatural forces and that Judaism believes in mysticism?</p>
<p>The answer to this very serious question is that Rambam held that these were all corruptions. In his view, true Judaism does not have any of the trappings of a supernaturalist cult. God is supernatural, a few miracles that were necessary for the birth of our nation occurred in Biblical times, but other than that, Judaism is a religion that is supposed to be hyper-focused on the practical matters of personal growth and emulating God in our lives.</p>
<p>Sure, many great people introduced mystical or supernatural elements into Judaism. Most people believe in them too. But in Rambam’s view, these are human additions and emendations. They are not integral to serving God, and may in fact harm our service of God.</p>
<p>For someone who believes in the supernatural and mystical this all sounds crazy. That’s fine. However, not everyone is predisposed to believing in things that they can’t see or prove. Those people may still be willing to suspend their disbelief or skepticism and believe in God or even in Divine Revelation. However, if they are not required to believe in mysticism and its trappings of Zoharic and Lurianic kabbalism, the ties to astrology, the use of charms and <em>segulos</em>, the existence of demons, the belief that human beings can be infallible, the idea that Chazal had access to modern science (but didn’t tell everyone about penicillin), that God still communicates with humans (but only to Orthodox Jews), and many other beliefs that require active supernaturalism and a healthy dose of non-skepticism, then why should they believe in those things? Further, if they were required to believe in these things, would it surprise us if they rejected the entire package? No, it would not. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/16/judaism-of-the-future-my-response-to-klal-perspectives-spring-2012/" target="_blank">Judaism of the Future: My Response to Klal Perspectives Spring 2012</a>)</p>
<p>Rationalist Judaism is a real thing. It’s not a fantasy. It’s not a boogeyman that seeks to demonize those who believe in supernatural Judaism. It’s an alternative for people who are more skeptical. It’s a way of serving God without being forced to believe in an entire universe that stretches beyond what is acceptable in their view. There are other side benefits to this perspective. Some of them have already been discussed on this and other blogs. One of those benefits will be the subject of a future post.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that one can practice Orthodox Judaism and love God and make a Kiddush Hashem without mysticism. It still works. Perhaps it even works better. But no matter how one practices their Judaism, it is wise to establish both views as viable options. In this way, we can ensure that the personality types that are drawn to mysticism and skepticism have a place in Orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sadducees.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7040" alt="sadducees" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sadducees.jpg?resize=264%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It is a commonly held belief in the orthodox Jewish community that the Sadducees and the Karaites are basically the same thing. The Sadducees, along with other sectarians, challenged the Pharisees and their interpretations of the Written Torah.</p>
<p>However, as I hope to explore a bit in a post sometime soon, they had their own Oral Traditions and methodology. It was a close cousin to the Pharisees and they did not disagree on all that much nor was there a very wide berth separating the groups. There was even some cross-pollination and we will see in that future post.</p>
<p>The Karaites came on the scene 800 years later. The Sadducees were long gone and the only group that was left standing from the tumultuous Second Temple Period were the Pharisees. While in some small ways, one can trace Karaite theology to some aspects of sectarian Second Temple movements, there was likely no continued, unbroken chain connected them to sectarians.</p>
<p><span id="more-7038"></span></p>
<p>This has been debated in academic circles for a while now and I don&#8217;t intend on resolving the debate in this post although I lean toward the side that says that Karaites started from scratch in the 9th century as a response to Islam.</p>
<p>Either way, it has become accepted wisdom in orthodox Judaism that Karaites are very similar to Sadducees and the terms are used interchangebly. I may have found an early source for this confusion. In his commentary on the Mishna in Avos, Maimonides says that Antignos Ish Socho taught that we should not do Mitzvos in anticipation of reward. Maimonides quotes the Avos D&#8217;Rabbi Nosson and writes that Tzadok and Bytus took this to mean that there is no reward in the next world and thereby launched their respective sectarian groups of the Sadducees (Tzadokim) and Boethusians (Bytusim). Maimonides continues and says that these groups survived to this very day (12th century) and are now called Karaites.</p>
<p>It seems that Maimonides lumps them together. This might be a mistake or just a clumsy way of grouping similar groups together. In truth, they are not so similar. Karaites would reject the Sadducee interpretations of the Torah as much as they would deny the truth of Pharisee interpretations. It&#8217;s imprecise to lump them together in an academic sense. Perhaps it makes sense to lump them together in a religious sense.</p>
<p>I think that this note by Maimonides could be one of the reasons rabbinic orthodox Judaism now fails to distinguish between the two groups. I would prefer precision for the sake of accuracy and truth. But more importantly, there is a lot we can learn about contemporary Judaism by looking at these groups and we can only even begin to do this if we have our terminology correct. Now that we do, I hope to continue exploring the relationship between the Pharisees and Sadducees in my next post on this topic. Hopefully tomorrow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7033" alt="library-books" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books.jpg?resize=298%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>There are several dozen prohibitions in the Torah that relate to idol worship. Writing in the 12th century, Maimonides stridently warns against studying the texts of idolatry or even learning about idol worship. (Hilchos Avodas Kochavim 2:2)</p>
<p>The argument against interfacing with idol worship is that the human mind is drawn towards the things that one studies. One is not always in perfect control of what one thinks and what one wants. So even if one is studying for the sake of satisfying curiosity, or even learning to rebut, one may be drawn toward idol worship. Maimonides extends this law to include heresy as well.</p>
<p>This is all kinds of depressing. Under this view, it can be extremely dangerous to study anything one does not already believe because whatever one studies for whatever reason can have a very negative influence. While it might be interesting to debate or dispute this assumption, I think there is a great positive lesson to be learned as well.<span id="more-7032"></span></p>
<p>If we are drawn toward the &#8220;wrong&#8221; things by studying them, we can also be drawn to the &#8220;right&#8221; things by studying them. If we want to be more drawn to our Judaism, we can jumpstart ourselves by studying Torah. It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything specific, it can be anything. I think a lot of people study things that they don&#8217;t enjoy and that causes them to want to study less. We would be wise to broaden the scope of what we study as a collective unit and give more people more opportunities to find things they enjoy studying. One doesn&#8217;t have to study the familiar texts. Study whatever Jewish texts you want. It seems that when one learns about anything, one is drawn toward that thing. We want to be more drawn to our Judaism. Let&#8217;s study.</p>
<p>Studying Torah is valuable for so many reasons. This just seems like another side benefit.</p>
<p>This is the most important thing we can do to keep ourselves, children, and communities on the path of Judaism. Study. We are the People of the Book and it is our duty to study and know the Book. Judaism requires us to be knowledgeable. But learning about Judaism seems like good advice anyway, even for people who are already quite observant. We should study things that we want to be drawn toward. Study Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6919" alt="A-7-toward-A-8" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-7-toward-A-8.jpg?resize=300%2C203" data-recalc-dims="1" />It&#8217;s amazing how often I can be talking with someone about Rambam and they are surprised when I tell them that it seems to me that Maimonides rejected mysticism. I am almost certain of it and I can show how it is a very nearly impossible presumption to disprove. But greater minds than mine have either doubted or rejected this claim so I try to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>There are four typical responses when people first hear that Rambam rejected mysticism:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s not true. They&#8217;ll quote the Brisker Rav who supposedly said that every line in the Moreh Nevuchim is based on 100 lines in the Zohar. Or the the Lubavitch view that Rambam was such a deep writer that it only appears to be &#8220;nigleh&#8221; but really it&#8217;s all nistar.</p>
<p>2) Nebach, Rambam never had a chance to learn real kabbalah because he was isolated. But if he did, he would have been a mystic for sure.</p>
<p>3) Of course Rambam held of mysticism, he just did not anything mystical in his books for some reason. [Insert reason]
<p>4) That&#8217;s cool. Tell me more.</p>
<p>I teach a Rambam class on Sunday mornings.<span id="more-6904"></span> We just learn Mishneh Torah and I provide insights based on the commentaries and my own personal experiences. From time to time, we learn a law in the text that reaffirms the rationalistic tendencies of Rambam. Here is an example.</p>
<p>מי שנידוהו בחלום אפילו ידע מי נידהו צריך עשרה בני אדם ששונין הלכות להתירו מנידויו ואם לא מצא טורח אחריהם עד פרסא לא מצא מתירים לו אפילו עשרה ששונים משנה לא מצא מתירין לו עשרה שיודעים לקרות בתורה לא מצא מתירין לו אפילו עשרה שאינן יודעין לקרות לא מצא במקומו עשרה מתירין לו אפילו שלשה.</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means if someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication. If he can&#8217;t find 10 people he should walk up to a <em>parsa</em> to find the requisite number of people.</p>
<p>From where does Rambam get this law? From the Talmud.</p>
<p>(אמר רב יוסף: נידוהו בחלום, צריך עשרה בני אדם להתיר לו.והוא דתנו הלכתא; אבל מתנו ולא תנו, לא. ואי ליכא דתנו הלכתא, אפילו מתנו ולא תנו.ואי ליכא, ליזיל וליתב אפרשת דרכים, ויהיב שלמא לבי עשרה, עד דמקלעי ליה עשרה דגמרי הלכתא. (נדרים ח א</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means that someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication, if he can&#8217;t find 1o people he should wait at the פרשת דרכים &#8211; junction &#8211; until he finds enough people.</p>
<p>The medieval commentators explain why he should go to the junction. Some say that he should greet everyone who he sees with a Shalom Aleichem and they will reply Aleichem Shalom. This will protect him from the apparent decree that has been decided against him as shown by the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>This interpretation assumes that the blessing of Aleichem Shalom actually protects someone. This is a mystical idea.</p>
<p>Rambam is uncomfortable with this idea. So either he uses a variant text (I have not seen any manuscripts with this text) or he changes the words פרשת דרכים to the word פרסא. They sound similar, but they have completely different meanings in this context. If you go with the concept found in the Talmud you are relying on mysticism to &#8220;keep you safe&#8221; until you can properly nullify the dreamy excommunication. If you go with Rambam&#8217;s version, it&#8217;s just a limitation on how far one must go to find people to nullify the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the explanation for this law in the Mishneh Torah has nothing to do with mysticism and rationalism? Sure. But the most elegant explanation is that Rambam made a conscious choice to excise this mystical idea from his book of law. Especially when you consider this example among the mountains of other similar instances.</p>
<p>All this means is that Rambam seems to have made an effort to be as rationalist as possible in the Mishneh Torah. Further conclusions are conjecture. Personally, when I see 100 signs telling me to go one direction, I figure that I should go in that direction. To me it seems that Rambam theologically rejected mysticism in every instance possible.</p>

<p>We finished chapter 4 today. I have no idea what happened to the audio of the first half of Chapter 4. Sorry! Here the Rambam instructs teachers and students how they are to interact while asking and answering questions. We had a bit of a digression where I impressed everyone with my rebbe&#8217;s amazing ability to be &#8220;holding&#8221; anywhere in Torah at any moment.</p>
<p>The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tefillin.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6144" title="tefillin" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tefillin.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Last week, an apocryphal story was being circulated on the JewsNews sites. The story goes something like this: A man bought a pair of tefilin 18 years ago. He used them for 12 years and then gave them to his son-in-law who used them for six years. During the 12 years the man used the tefillin he lost two of his sons before they reached bar mitzvah. One was 12 and the other was 6. During the time that the son-in-law used the tefillin his son a was very badly burned among other difficulties.</p>
<p>The tefillin were checked for mistakes and a missing word was the discovered. It seems that the word &#8220;Bni&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;my son&#8221;  was missing from one of the chapters.</p>
<p>The story is being circulated by the scribe who checked the tefillin to urge people to check their tefillin.</p>
<p>In case you need someone to connect the dots for you, the story is making the claim that the missing word is related to the death and burning of the three sons in the story. That relationship is undefined in the story but it goes something like this: The tefillin had a mistake in the word Bni and that either caused or should have alarmed the owners that something was going to happen with their sons.</p>
<p>First of all, whenever you hear a story like this, consider the source. The source is a tefillin checking company. Is that a proof that the story is untrue? No. But it seriously affects the credibility of the story.</p>
<p>Second of all, all tefillin are checked before they are sold. I find it unlikely that a mistake as glaring as a missing word slipped by the checkers. It&#8217;s not as if a word can simply disappear and the other words slip into place leaving no empty space for the missing word.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s assume the facts of the story are true. What do we make of this?<span id="more-6142"></span></p>
<p>The idea that a mistake, an honest mistake, in one&#8217;s tefillin is troubling theologically. Normative Jewish thought emphasizes intent for good deeds and deemphasizes strict liability for mistakes. To illustrate: If one intends to give charity but then the money gets stolen, God will credit the person for giving the charity because the person had intent and the action that was attached to the intent was not completed due to something out of his control. Conversely, if one intends to sin but because of circumstances our of one&#8217;s control, the sin is never committed, one is not liable for the sin. Further, if one sinned by mistake or through negligence the sin is not considered a full sin, rather it is a separate category of mistake and none of the usual punishments apply, rather one would bring a sacrifice to atone for the mistake.</p>
<p>So it seems incongruous that a missing word in the tefillin would have such a drastic effect if it was an error when if one violated the Shabbos by mistake one would only need to bring a sacrifice!</p>
<p>The idea that people would die because of scribal errors is troubling for other reasons as well. This is a case of the sharpshooter fallacy. Tefillin have mistakes all the time. Yet, almost none of the people wearing those tefillin suffer the degree of harm suffered in this story. This story is highlighted because the facts work out neatly, but ask any scribe about the myriad of other mistakes that are found due to wear and tear or poor writing in the first place (assuming this does happen) and you won&#8217;t hear of correlating tragedies. How do I know? Because if it happened all the time, we would hear about it all the time. Classic sharpshooter fallacy.</p>
<p>Additionally, what kind of God kills children because of scribal errors?</p>
<p>The usual response to this is that God is not as nice as we would like to think. God is very harsh. There are tragedies and sadness in the world and God allows them to happen. Why should this be any different? The response to that logic is that there is nothing to be gained by making God even meaner than God already appears to be. In other words, there are some things that we must accept theologically and there are others that we do not. Why would we want to turn our God into a God who avenges scribal errors with death of children if we are not forced to do so by any preexisting rule of theology?!</p>
<p>Finally we get to the core of the issue. People who find this story meaningful are borrowing a widespread idea about mezuzah and applying it to tefillin. A fairly recent principle states that a mezuzah is a form of magical protection over one&#8217;s home. If the mezuzah is incomplete or missing, one loses the protection. It has therefore become en vogue to &#8220;check the mezuzah&#8221; if tragedy befalls a home. The sharpshooter fallacy applies here as well. Yet, this idea has a lot of traction. What is happening in this story is the mezuzah concept is being extended to tefillin.</p>
<p>There are two very significant problems with this.</p>
<p>1) There are many sources that attribute protection to mezuzah. The interpretation of those sources is the subject of #2. But the sources are there. So while subject to the analysis of #2, mezuzah may have theological basis to be a protection and mezuzah errors may foretell or even cause harm, no such sources exist for tefilin as far as I know. Thus, extending the mezuzah concept to tefilin may be a complete fabrication. That is a problem,</p>
<p>2) Do we have to believe that a mistake in a mezuzah can cause harm? The answer is no. An excellent article by Professor Martin Gordon debunks the magical protections of mezuzah as a recent and unnecessary innovation. You can read the article here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mezuza-gordon.pdf" target="_blank">Mezuzah: Protective Amulet or Religious Symbol</a>. In essence, Dr. Gordon shows that there is no basis to compel one to accept the idea that checking one&#8217;s mezuzah is a form of insuring against tragedy. There is no necessary theological reason to believe in the magical powers of mezuzah in the first place. If we take the rug from under the mezuzah belief then there is no analogy to tefilin that could make this story meaningful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to end with the words of Rambam at the end of the Laws of Mezuzah:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Whoever wears tefillin on his head and arm, wears tzitzit on his garment, and has a mezuzah on his entrance, can be assured that he will not sin, because he has many who will remind him. These are the angels, who will prevent him from sinning, as [Psalms 34:8] states: &#8220;The angel of God camps around those who fear Him and protects them.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Blessed be God who offers assistance.</em></p>
<p>This might sound like some sort of support for the idea that mezuzah and tefilin are related to one&#8217;s safety. However, a careful reading debunks this as well. Rambam is saying that wearing a mitzvah on one&#8217;s arm and head, one&#8217;s body, and placing a mitzvah on one&#8217;s door will protect a person <em>from sin </em>because they will serve as <em>reminders </em>of what one is supposed to do. Rambam continues, <em>these </em>are the angels. Meaning, the reminders provided by doing mitzvahs are the angels. Not that doing these mitzvahs <em>creates</em> magical creatures who protect us. Rather the constant reminders help us avoid sin and those reminders serves a metaphorical guardian angel that aids us in avoiding sin. This fits in well with Rambam&#8217;s rejection of the usual understanding of angels as magical creatures that exists in reality.</p>
<p>It is not a surprise that Rambam does not believe in the magical powers of tefilin and mezuzah. Nor is it a surprise that orthodox Jews believe in it today. But we do not do mitzvahs because we are looking for magical protections. We do them because God commanded us to do so. We believe that they are good acts that help us perfect ourselves. But we do not need to hang on to <em>bubbe mysahs </em>like this recent tale to serve Hashem properly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Men-at-work-sign.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5708" title="Men at work sign" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Men-at-work-sign.jpg?resize=300%2C242" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Last week there was a bit of a discussion in the comments of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/31/thoughts-on-the-tragic-divorce-article-in-ami-magazine/">Thoughts on the Tragic Divorce Article in Ami Magazine</a> and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/238541202923059" target="_blank">Facebook</a> about the position of Maimonides on the issue of the Kollel lifestyle. What follows is not a discussion of the practical halacha. Rather, this is an exploration of the sources in the writings of the Rambam.</p>
<p>In a responsa, R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein clearly holds that one is permitted to take money to study in Kollel, <em>even</em> according to the Rambam. See the Responsa here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/R-Moshe-Kollel.pdf" target="_blank">Igros Moshe</a>. Indeed, the Kesef Mishnah largely dismisses the sources for Maimonides&#8217; position and simply states that no one really goes with this Rambam.</p>
<p>So it is clear, this is not a referendum on Kollel. This is simply an academic exercise to determine precisely what Maimonides meant in two seemingly conflicting passages.</p>
<p>We begin with the source that seems to frown upon one benefitting financially from one&#8217;s status as a Torah scholar and shunning typical work.<span id="more-5699"></span> <em>(Translations courtesy of Rabbi Touger)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mishneh Torah, Talmud Torah, 3:10</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Anyone who comes to the conclusion that he should involve himself in Torah study without doing work and derive his livelihood from charity, desecrates [God&#8217;s] name, dishonors the Torah, extinguishes the light of faith, brings evil upon himself, and forfeits the life of the world to come, for it is forbidden to derive benefit from the words of Torah in this world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our Sages declared: &#8220;Whoever benefits from the words of Torah forfeits his life in the world.&#8221; Also, they commanded and declared: &#8220;Do not make them a crown to magnify oneself, nor an axe to chop with.&#8221; Also, they commanded and declared: &#8220;Love work and despise Rabbinic positions.&#8221; All Torah that is not accompanied by work will eventually be negated and lead to sin. Ultimately, such a person will steal from others.</p>
<p>This is a pretty hard line. If we would stop here, we would be left with one obvious conclusion. The Rambam holds that one must earn a living through any means besides one&#8217;s Torah prowess. One is obligated to study and achieve scholarship in Torah. But one is not allowed to leverage one&#8217;s Torah status into a free ride. It seems unequivocal from this source.</p>
<p>But then we turn to the end of the Laws of Shmitta and Yovel.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mishneh Torah, Shmitta V&#8217;Yovel, 13:12</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Why did the Levites not receive a portion in the inheritance of Eretz Yisrael and in the spoils of war like their brethren? Because they were set aside to serve God and minister unto Him and to instruct people at large in His just paths and righteous judgments, as [Deuteronomy 33:10] states: &#8220;They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Torah to Israel.&#8221; Therefore they were set apart from the ways of the world. They do not wage war like the remainder of the Jewish people, nor do they receive an inheritance, nor do they acquire for themselves through their physical power. Instead, they are God&#8217;s legion, as [ibid.:11]: states: &#8220;God has blessed His legion&#8221; and He provides for them, as [Numbers 18:20] states: &#8220;I am your portion and your inheritance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mishneh Torah, Shmitta V&#8217;Yovel, 13:13</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Not only the tribe of Levi, but any one of the inhabitants of the world whose spirit generously motivates him and he understands with his wisdom to set himself aside and stand before God to serve Him and minister to Him and to know God, proceeding justly as God made him, removing from his neck the yoke of the many reckonings which people seek, he is sanctified as holy of holies. God will be His portion and heritage forever and will provide what is sufficient for him in this world like He provides for the priests and the Levites. And thus David declared [Psalms 16:5]: &#8220;God is the lot of my portion; You are my cup, You support my lot.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Blessed be the Merciful One who provides assistance.</p>
<p>To summarize these two selections: The Levites did not bear the burden of earning a livelihood. They were the tribe of teachers and servants of God. They were supported by the tithes that the Jewish people gave to them. This is what it means in Numbers when it states &#8220;I am your <em>portion</em> and your inheritance&#8221;. The &#8220;I&#8221; refers to God and the method by which He is the portion of the Levites is that He provides for them via the tithes.</p>
<p>Next, the Rambam provides an allowance for  a non-Levite to do the same. The non-Levite can dedicate his life to God as well. God will be his <em>portion</em> as well. What does it mean to be God&#8217;s portion in this context? It would seem that it would be analogous to being supported by tithes, that is via charity.</p>
<p>So which is it? Can a Torah scholar who wants to teach and inspire remove the shackles of earning a living and be supported by God, meaning charity? Or not?</p>
<p>I think the resolution to this problem is really quite simple once we look at <strong>Commentary on the Mishnah of Maimonides</strong>. In the fourth chapter of Ethics of our Fathers, <em>Rabbi Tzadok says that one should not use the Torah as a crown to appear great. Further, one should not use the Torah as a plowshare to be used for plowing.</em></p>
<p>Maimonides gets on his soapbox and literally rants for several paragraphs about the issue we are discussing in this post. He says that he is going to be very clear because his opponents, the greatest of the Torah scholars of the time, twist the sources to suit their needs and will not change their minds even though they are absolutely incorrect. It seems that the primary complaint he raises against them was that they required people donate charity against their will to support people who were studying until those people were too old and frail to work and then they needed the money simply to live.</p>
<p>Among his proofs that he is correct are assertions that the great Tannaim and Amoraim all worked for a living. He then uses two stories from the Talmud to demonstrate that the giants of the Talmud refused to use their scholarly status for personal gain or financial gain.</p>
<p>All the way at the end of his truly epic manifesto on this subject are the key phrases to unlocking this secret. What follows is the best translation I could muster. Items in brackets are my additions to make the text clearer. All emphasis and errors are mine. (Full Hebrew text here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0907.jpg%20" target="_blank">Page 1</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0908.jpg%20" target="_blank">page 2</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0909.jpg%20" target="_blank">page 3</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0910.jpg" target="_blank">page 4</a>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But the thing that the Torah did permit for Torah scholars [to benefit from their scholarship] is to allow someone else to manage their investments on their behalf, if the other person is willing [and to do it free of charge], and one who does this for a Torah scholar will receive [heavenly] reward for his efforts, and this is one who fills the pockets of Talmidei Chachamim [who is privileged to sit in the Heavenly Academy as per Pesachim 53B]. Similarly, to [make a deal whereby one makes a standing] offer to purchase all of the Torah scholar&#8217;s goods before they hit the marketplace [is permissible] because these are the special rights that God has provided [Torah scholars] <em>just like God provides the gifts and tithes to the Priests and Levites, </em>as this [the enumerated special rights] come to the Torah scholars through that prophets. Similarly, the Torah exempts Torah scholars from all community taxes that are used for infrastructure needs and other public works, even if he is a wealthy Torah scholar he is exempt from these payments. [&#8230;] and these exemptions are similar to the exemption the Priest had from paying the half-shekel as we have explained in its place. And so too all analogous cases.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we have the resolution to our problem. In the Commentary to the Mishnah, Maimonides describes minor economic benefits as appropriate for Torah Scholars. In his views, these benefits are God given. He then compares these minor benefits to the benefits that God provides the Priest and Levite. In other words, when he writes in Shmitta and Yovel that God will provide for the Torah scholar just as God provides for the Levite it seems that he is referring to this kind of economic benefit. It <em>does not </em>mean that God will provide for the Torah scholar through charity. Rather, as we have seen, there are some economic benefits through which the Torah scholar may get a leg up on the competition.</p>
<p>Maimonides&#8217; objection to benefitting financially from Torah scholar status or the dissemination of Torah remains constant. It is forbidden to use communal funds to support Torah scholars and it is forbidden for Torah scholars to take money in return for Torah related services. When Maimonides mentions the idea that a non-Levite can dedicate his life to God and God will provide, the meaning is that God will provide via the minor economic benefits enumerated above. It does not mean that God will provide via miracles or charity.</p>
<p>True to his teaching, Maimonides earned a livelihood as a physician. But it is also possible that he availed himself to the economic benefit he mentions in the excerpt from the Commentary on the Mishnah. We know that his brother David managed his investments on his behalf. It is certainly not outside the realm of possibility the David did not charge his brother Moses for his services as per the economic benefit accorded to Torah scholars.</p>
<p>In closing, I think Maimonides was in fact speaking to a specific set of circumstances when he unequivocally banned Torah scholars from using their Torah knowledge to earn a living. It seems it was an involuntary system that he most abhorred as well. Today, most people supporting others in learning and rabbis or teachers taking salaries for Torah related jobs are under very different circumstances whether it is the giver or the taker. Certainly, the refrain of the Kesef Mishnah is appropriate in our day and age. If we don&#8217;t support some Torah scholars we might not have any Torah scholars!</p>
<p>However, to assert that Kollel as a standard for everyone is the &#8220;way it always was and always will be&#8221; is to ignore the plain facts as Maimonides saw them. In his opinion, the Torah sources demand everyone achieve Torah scholarship and that they earn a living from another source of income. Even if we do not find Maimonides&#8217; ruling binding on us today, his social commentary still carries a lot of weight. He felt the ultimate Jewish society did not need to pay non-Priests and non-Levites to learn and teach Torah. He certainly felt that we are supposed to work and earn a living and not that earning a living is only for the weak Torah scholars or unsuccessful Yeshiva students.</p>
<p>No matter how the orthodox Jewish community proceeds, I think it worthwhile to present this view of Maimonides approach to, at the very least, lessen the unfortunate stigma that has become attached to people going to work for a living. Working for a living should feel like the right thing to do because according to Maimonides that is how it is supposed to be and how it always has been.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tours_maimonides_tomb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5515" title="tours_maimonides_tomb" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tours_maimonides_tomb.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>An article in Haaretz caught my eye.</p>
<p>Maimonides was a hyper-rationalist. He did not believe in mysticism and fought vehemently against it. One aspect of mysticism is praying at tombs of holy people. Yet, for hundreds of years people have made pilgrimage to Tiberias in the north of Israel to pay respect a the grave of Maimonides and pray at his tomb.</p>
<p>Compared with other holy sites, the tomb of Maimonides is in need of renovations and a facelift. A $10 million project will spruce up the tomb and make it more inviting for visitors.</p>
<p>The problem is that Maimonides himself felt strongly that one should not make a grave into a holy site.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Donniel Hartmann paraphrased the words of Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah:  &#8220;For holy men, no headstones should be built on their graves because their words are their memory&#8230; and people should not visit graves.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty clear that Maimonides would not be in favor of this renovation or visitors to his tomb.<span id="more-5512"></span></p>
<p>So is it ironic? Or a chutzpah?</p>
<p>It feels similar to Mormons baptizing Jews. It&#8217;s one religious group using their beliefs in an ironic way. Jews don&#8217;t believe in Jesus so we don&#8217;t really care for the Baptism. But Mormons feel like they are doing us a favor. Similarly, Maimonides didn&#8217;t believe in praying at grave sites, but mystics probably feel like they are doing him a favor by praying at his site even though they must think that he was wrong about the whole not praying at grave sites thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find it amusing.</p>
<p>I saved this post for International Jewish Mysticism Day (otherwise known as Lag B&#8217;Omer) to lodge a tiny rationalist counterbalance against the overwhelming mysticism of the day. That is my way of being ironic.</p>

		<itunes:summary>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/rambam.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Rambam class continued today.

Today we continued chapter 6. This chapter is a culmination of all the foundational principles of the first five chapters. The mitzvos that relate to this section of the Rambam are found in this chapter and we studied several more of them today. We began the laws of Lashon Hara as codified by the Rambam.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

Today we began Chapter 3 in Hilchos Deyos. In this chapter the Rambam instructs us in some of the most basic approaches to life. Some of the examples revert back to Medieval science, but the lessons and message of using &quot;modern medicine&quot; to live a good life is an eternal message.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

<p>The University of Oxford has made the original manuscript of the Mishnah Torah available online.</p>
<p>Maimonides personally authorized this manuscript. It fell to a later man who stipulated in his will:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And in its entirety be placed in the keeping of the Bet Din forever, it is not to be sold or redeemed, nor should any single person ever take possession of it. It should rather be kept available so that all scholars can correct their version against it, but not read from it or copy from it. Rather, anyone wishing to correct his version should borrow the volume he needs from the Bet Din, leaving a bond against its value with the Bet Din, until he corrects his own book and returns it. It is a mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased and let no one alter this testament.</em></p>
<p>Now  the manuscript is fully accessible to the public. The Oxford library has digitized every page in high definition and made it available to the public.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no scholar of ancient texts. But there are scholars of ancient texts. A large group of them has been studying the evolution of the text of the Tanach (the Jewish version of the Old Testament) for 53 years.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the text we have today has remained virtually unchanged since the 11th century. It was then that Maimonides used the Aleppo Codex to codify a version of the Torah scroll. That version is almost exactly what we have today.</p>
<p>But notice, I used the word &#8220;almost&#8221;. That&#8217;s because it is not exactly the same. Or it might not be exact. There are several nuances that differentiate the standard Torah scroll used in the majority of Jewish communities from the Yemenite Torah text tradition. They can&#8217;t both be exactly the same as the text codified by Maimonides.<span id="more-4518"></span></p>
<p>Certainly the Talmud seems to indicate that they had a different version. The Talmud in Kiddushin gives specific places as the middle of the text and the number of words and letters. None of those are consistent with our text. In several places various rishonim (Medieval commentators) indicate that there were small differences between the Torah scrolls among their peers. Other rishonim stated that the text was deliberately changed by later prophets in certain instances. They were permitted to do so as long as none of the Torah&#8217;s laws were affected by their changes.</p>
<p>None of the differences that have been recorded are significant enough to change the law. None of the discrepancies have an effect of the theology or religion of the Torah. Yet, there has emerged a &#8220;sacred belief&#8221; that the Torah remains unchanged over the 3000 years since the Revelation at Sinai.</p>
<p>This is quite obviously impossible.</p>
<p>A massive project in Israel is charting all the extant versions of the text and their collective history. They are using every possible version and manuscript to show any and all minor differences between each version. The Aleppo Codex is the starting point for the project and all differences are being compared to that version.</p>
<p>And there are differences. It is impossible to pretend otherwise. But this should not be a problem for believers in orthodox Judaism. There are several acceptable approaches to the issues raised by the variations in the text. Each approach appeals to different styles within orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>1) Hashgacha pratis. God runs the world. Whatever changes that have evolved are part of a grand Master Plan.</p>
<p>2) Lo bashamayim hi. &#8220;The Torah is not in the Heavens&#8221;. Once the Torah was given to Man, it was understood that there would be mistakes. We do our best to avoid mistakes, but errors are inevitable and it cannot be legitimately stated that our version is perfect.</p>
<p>3) Torah She&#8217;Baal Peh is primary. The truth is that we do not live our lives as orthodox Jews based on the Written Law as much as we lived based on its interpretation in the Oral Law. Mistakes in the Written Law have no real bearing on a Jewish life based on the Oral Law.</p>
<p>Certainly each of these positions is more nuanced and broad than the one or two sentence headlines mentioned here. The point is that approaches exist and we should not be afraid of them.</p>
<p>What about the 8th principle of faith according to the Rambam?</p>

<p>The Mishna teaches us, חיב אדם לברך על הרעה כשם שהוא מברך על הטובה. &#8220;One is obligated to bless the negative the same way one is obligated to bless the positive&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Rambam understands this to mean that since we do not know what the end of the story will be, it is not rational to be angry or upset when things go wrong. The isolated moment may seem too difficult to bear, but that is because our vision is limited to the moment.</p>
<p>This can be understood one of two ways. One is that we may never know why bad things happen, but we can know that we cannot understand them because our vision is limited. Therefore we should bless the bad with the good and trust that it will be good eventually. I believe this is a difficult position. What good can come from a vile murder and what good can come when the murderer is from our own community?</p>
<p>There is a second approach.<span id="more-4435"></span> This approach holds that we can write our own ending to the story. The horrible events are part of a larger picture, but that picture is not complete. We can finish that picture, write our own ending. Sometimes the greatest redemption comes from the most difficult times. We bless the bad with the good because we believe that the terrible tragedy that occurred will bring about change and improvements. It may hurt a lot. But it is something worthy of blessing.</p>
<p>This is what I referred to when I wrote that there is a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/07/13/orthodox-jewish-boy-found-brutally-murdered/" target="_blank">silver lining in dark cloud</a>**.</p>
<p>I believe there is an opportunity for our community to refocus on one broad issue and one specific issue that arise from this nightmare.</p>
<p>The broad issue requires some background. Ashkenazik Jews, for the most part, were persecuted mercilessly by their overlords. For 1000 years Jews lived in fear of their non-Jewish neighbors, were picked on by their local and national governments, were the scapegoats for major events and eventually it all ended with the Holocaust. That is the 1000 year legacy of Ashkenazik Jewry. It has had a major effect on the collective psyche of the Ashkenazik Jew. It leaves an indelible mark of victimhood and fear of the outsider. It has spawned the insular Orthodox Jewish communities of Boro Park, Flatbush, Williamsburg, Monsey, Lakewood, Kiryas Joel and others. It has fueled an anti-Semitism paranoia where the &#8220;other&#8221; is to be feared, possibly loathed but always looked upon with skepticism. It has created a social system that works hard to prevent the &#8220;outside&#8221; from coming in because the outside is scary, the inside is safe. Social issues within the orthodox community are frequently blamed on the outside influences and have become, in an ironic twist, the scapegoat for the community&#8217;s problems.</p>
<p>However, this has had two negative side affects. First, it teaches us that we need to fear the outside, and if we don&#8217;t shut it out, we will lose what we have. This is not a true statement. Many of our great rabbis and leaders since the times of the Mishna were active on the &#8220;outside&#8221;. They held jobs, interacted with the people of their day who were not from their community and taught their communities how to appreciate their beautiful Jewish tradition, live a committed life and still be a participant in the outside world. But 1000 years of hate and persecution has created an environment where we focus less on what is special and unique and worthwhile on the inside and more on what is wrong, corrupt and evil on the outside.</p>
<p>We definitely lose something with our collective reticence to participating in the outside. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/11/obligatory-ted-williams-post/" target="_blank">I have quoted LeAnne Tuohy</a> as saying that the cure for cancer may be in our inner cities. But it may never be discovered because of all the great minds we lose to inner city culture and violence. A similar thought might be said about the insular Jewish communities. Who knows what we might be losing by limiting our opportunities?</p>
<p>The second, perhaps more nefarious side effect, is that it creates a level of comfort on the inside that falsely promises that everything inside is safe. If all the evil is outside then the inside is completely safe. While the inside is generally made up of wonderful, charitable, righteous people, they are not the only people on the inside. Nothing could be more wrong. There is evil in our midst as well. There is abuse, there is crime, there is corruption, there is bigotry, there are some rotten people. They are few and far between, but they are there. But by focusing so much on the evil on the outside, we have come to allow, and by implication, give tacit approval to the evil on the inside. Feeling that we can trust anybody with the orthodox Jewish uniform is a shaky proposition. It always has been, but now it is more clear than ever before.</p>
<p>The inside has a history of protecting its own. Even when its own are bad people. The over-emphasis on how bad it is on the outside has given a virtual playground for the predators among us to thrive on the inside.</p>
<p>And so, the Leiby Kletzky nightmare has us waking up in a cold sweat. The challenge for us is to manufacture our own silver lining. We need to write the end of the story by righting the ship.</p>
<p>I believe that we can learn from this horrible incident that the current social structure and strictures in our insular communities may be beginning to harm us as much as they have helped us. Broadly, it harms us because it limits our opportunities and specifically it harms us because it has allowed us to protect the most dangerous people in our communities.</p>
<p>Turning for a moment to Levi Aron, I believe we failed him and ourselves as a society. His mental illness went untreated, his anti-social behavior raised no flags, his &#8220;creepiness&#8221; was not something to consider but one thing above all is what allowed this to happen. In an environment where everyone is presumed safe, a man with the right uniform isn&#8217;t considered a stranger. A man who invites a different child into his car earlier in the day is not reported because it does not even occur to people that the man may be dangerous. I am not saying that Aron was clearly dangerous, but I am saying that warning signs existed. In a community where warning signs are ignored because they can&#8217;t possibly be warning of something calamitous, because the inside is always safe, we can find ourselves in the middle of a nightmare.</p>
<p>It is my sincere hope that my words have not offended anybody. I don&#8217;t place any blame on anyone involved in the story not name Levi Aron. A social structure and community are not choices that individuals make. They evolve and sometimes we need something to shape the next stage of their evolution.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope this will be a start.</p>
