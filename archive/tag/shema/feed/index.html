				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Shema_Yisrael.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6497" title="Shema_Yisrael" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Shema_Yisrael-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>A little background: Someone I know, and respect, was watching a documentary online about something Jewish history related. One of the people interviewed in the documentary was Professor Lawrence Schiffman. Some time later, this fellow mentioned something about &#8220;the conservative rabbi in the documentary&#8221;. I did not understand who he was talking about. Eventually we figured out that he was talking about Prof. Schiffman. Incredulous, I told this person that Prof. Schiffman is a very orthodox Jew and certainly not a conservative rabbi!</p>
<p>But I think I can understand why a run of the mill orthodox Jew would consider Prof. Schiffman conservative. It is on display in his recent, <a href="http://lawrenceschiffman.com/the-lord-is-one-reflections-on-the-history-of-judaism-in-light-of-the-shema-text-from-halbturn-austria/" target="_blank">magnificent blog post about an 1800 year old Golden Shema plate from Austria</a>. The article is really incredible in its scope and implication and I highly recommend reading it for several reasons.</p>
<p>The point I wish to focus our attention is the overall theme that Judaism has evolved, but not just from the time of the Mishna to now, it evolved from the time of entering the Land of Israel with Joshua to the time of the Mishna. Primarily, Prof. Schiffman suggests that monotheism in Judaism changed from a fuzzy version of One God with multiple Deity like figures to a more modern version of Monotheism where there is One God and no other power.</p>
<p>Things like magical spells are permissible using this original form of fuzzy monotheism, if done in the right way. Once the rabbis of the mishna modernized and canonized monotheism in a more rigid manner, &#8220;white&#8221; magic would be prohibited.<span id="more-6496"></span></p>
<p>To me, this also explains how in the origins of Christianity a Trinity was not so completely at odds with Judaism. There was an ancient Jewish tradition of fuzzy monotheism to draw from. The immediate reaction was to counter with rigid monotheism and then later on, the Mystics, according to Chacham Faur, reinvigorated some of the fuzzy monotheistic flavor back into Judaism.</p>
<p>But the overarching theme here is that things do change and Judaism does respond to social, political, and religious conditions. Whether is a conscious move or a subconcsious drift, Judaism is not a monolith and it never really has been.</p>
<p>As Prof. Schiffman concludes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This is Judaism as a historical phenomenon in ancient times.  To deny this diversity and to use the term “Judaisms” is also to deny its continuity and commonality and, hence, to deny its essence.  To deny its variegation is to turn it into a cult, in the modern sense of the term. To deny its often fuzzy boundaries is to deny its identity.</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But to state this today is to contradict the contemporary orthodox Jewish narrative. Saying these things implies something other than orthodox Judaism. It can lead an objective, honest, 2012 orthodox Jew to think that this is objectionable and only that for some reason only makes sense in the paradigm of conservative Judaism. That is a shame. Let us hope that we can broaden the spectrum just enough to be more honest about the evolution of Judaism. Let us try to ensure that there is a place, if not a primary one, for acknowledging Judaism&#8217;s capacity to change and at the same time be inclusive of many different shapes and forms even within orthodox Judaism.</p>
