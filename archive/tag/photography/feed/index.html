				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, three young men from Gush Etzion were kidnapped. We have not heard from them since. But we have heard from legions of supporters and well-wishers who are joining in the communal suffering and public outrage.</p>
<p>At the end of the first week, mothers from the Alon Shvut area of the Gush arranged for a gathering celebrating life, group prayer, and song. They met at the bus stop that has been identified as the place of the kidnapping. The scene of the crime. Photographer <a href="http://ImagesThroughTime.com" target="_blank">Rebecca Kowalsky</a> was present and she captured the spirit and emotion of the day magnificently. The photos speak for themselves.</p>
<p>As time marches on, it is important to remind ourselves of the mental anguish we felt when this ordeal was fresh. I think a week after this event is good a time as any to relive it through the lens of Ms. Kowalsky.</p>
<p>May we merit to hear good news soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we read Parshas Kedoshim. Some of the most well-known and important commandments are in this week&#8217;s reading. Kedoshim is one source that teaches us that we are prohibited from engaging in negative speech, commonly known as Lashon Hara.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I compiled a rudimentary list of fairly obvious ways that historical trends within Torah Judaism has either been heavily influenced or borrowed from its surrounding culture. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/26/torah-and-the-winds-of-change/" target="_blank">Torah and the Winds of Change</a>) In the weeks since, I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for more examples of this phenomenon. I thought of something very interesting during Pesach after seeing a Facebook post by the great Gideon Slifkin.<span id="more-8340"></span></p>
<p>This was his post:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a nice point and reinforces the importance of adhering to the real Torah position on reporting abuse, the one that holds that reporting abuse to the authorities is not Lashon Hara. Regardless, it made me think of the how Lashon Hara is emphasized more in the modern era than ever before. There is no authoritative text dedicated to the laws of proper speech that would serve as the precursor to the Chofetz Chaim. It&#8217;s the first of its kind. Subsequent to the publication and immense popularity of the book, Orthodox Jews have placed much value on the virtues of proper speech.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/0_99103_ffb3628f_XXL.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-8343" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/0_99103_ffb3628f_XXL.jpg?resize=484%2C381" alt="0_99103_ffb3628f_XXL" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I attended Ner Israel Mechina High School in Baltimore. The high school policy was to moderately discourage the students from studying mussar books in 9th and 10th grade. The reasons are not important, but I loved the policy. There were two exceptions to the rule, the commentary of the Vilna Gaon on Pirkei Avos and Chofetz Chaim. That&#8217;s how deep Chofetz Chaim has burrowed into the consciousness of our society. It&#8217;s one of two recommended volumes on character development for younger high school students.</p>
<p>That means there was a shift in values sometime in the mid to late 19th century. The Chofetz Chaim may have initiated this movement on his own through some intuition. He may have just done what he touhght was right and it happened to catch on. Or, he may have been riding a wave of change in his time and place that reflected similar values.</p>
<p>One of the greatest contributions to all of legal writing is the great article by Justice Brandeis and Justice S. Warren, &#8220;<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html" target="_blank">The Right to Privacy</a>.&#8221; This article established an legally recognized expectation of privacy for all United States citizens. The article was published in 1890, just 17 years after the publication of Chofetz Chaim. Brandeis and Warren would not have written their article in 1830 or 1685 or 1328. Their article was a clear response to the challenges of their era.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next step which must be taken for the protection of the person, and for securing to the individual what Judge Cooley calls the right &#8220;to be let alone.&#8221; Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life; and numerous mechanical devices threaten to make good the prediction that &#8220;what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the house-tops.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The popularity of newspapers and photography in the mid 19th century gave rise to a growing concern over privacy. People&#8217;s private business was being broadcast at an unprecedented pace and with an irreverence that clouded better judgment. It was a brave new world.</p>
<p>To address these new, modern concerns, &#8220;The Right to Privacy&#8221; was published in the Harvard Law Review. The authors conclude:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;In general, then, the matters of which the publication should be repressed may be described as those which concern the private life, habits, acts, and relations of an individual, and have no legitimate connection with his fitness for a public office which he seeks or for which he is suggested, or for any public or quasi public position which he seeks or for which he is suggested, and have no legitimate relation to or bearing upon any act done by him in a public or quasi public capacity.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This policy provided the first legal framework for curbing the publication of gossip and slander. It was their legal solution to a new social problem.</p>
<p>Parenthetically, the privacy concerns of 1890 sound familiar to us today, but they are hilariously out of proportion with modern privacy concerns. The law has not adequately addressed the current concerns, but I think that the laws of Lashon Hara are sufficiently pliable to give us a framework for dealing with the challenges of modernity.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s likely that the same social concerns that forced Justices Brandeis and Warren to pen &#8220;The Right of Privacy,&#8221; influenced Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagen to codify a comprehensive text on the laws of Lashon Hara. It wasn&#8217;t on a whim that he published Chofetz Chaim. It wasn&#8217;t an accident. The Chofetz Chaim was published to meet the demands of its time. The rise of the mass media caused the rise of concern over privacy. It also likely influenced Rabbi Kagen to take the initiative to write a book of Jewish Law and inspiration to meet those same concerns.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible that &#8220;The Right to Privacy&#8221; inspired the publication of Chofetz Chaim because it was written 17 years later. It&#8217;s also nearly impossible that Justices Brandeis and Warren were influenced by Chofetz Chaim. Brandeis was a Jew, but it seems extremely unlikely that either of them read the book. Thus, the most reasonable explanation for both publications were common social concerns. The new information era demanded fresh ideas and a shift in perspective.</p>
<p>Thus, we have an additional example of the attitudes and values of the Torah lifestyle being influenced by outside factors. Prior to 1873, Lashon Hara did not have the exalted status that it has today. That is a shift in values. It&#8217;s possible this sight was completely shaped by internal concerns. But after seeing the same elements contributing to &#8220;The Right of Privacy,&#8221; I think Ockham would agree that his razor would suggest that both shifts in attitude were shaped by the challenges and milieu of the late 19th century.</p>
<p>As for us, the winds of change that brought Chofetz Chaim and vigilance over our speech to prominence are only more conspicuous in 2014. The laws of Lashon Hara apply now more than ever. In the digital era they are more relevant and vital than ever. Familiarize yourself with the laws. Be careful about what you say. And equally important, know when negative speech is not considered Lashon Hara so that we do not use it as a shield to protect the guilty and harm the innocent. Justice Brandeis was responsible for establishing the right to privacy, but he was equally known for coining the phrase &#8220;Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proper approach requires balance. Let us hope that we can all find that balance in our private lives, digital interactions, and meeting the challenges of dealing with predators and villains in our community.</p>

Traffic wasn&#8217;t too bad. It took 17 hours less than expected to reopen the 405 and as far as I know, the local impact did not come near the hype.</p>
<p>But forget what you would do if you needed to get from Burbank to Long Beach, (flying on Jet Blue was slower than public transportation and biking.) What would you do to commemorate the time where the 405 was empty? One of the busiest thoroughfares in the entire world. Serene. Silent. Empty.</p>
<p>These folks are the winners so far.<span id="more-4455"></span></p>
<p>They made a dinner party on the 405. Complete with a table, fine china, table linens, formal dress and gourmet food. They set up the party quickly. Ate. Took a photo for posterity and in my opinion, WIN the &#8220;what&#8217;s the coolest thing you could do on the 405 during Carmageddon&#8221; contest.</p>
<p>Can you top this?</p>

It&#8217;s not our fault, picture and films from the era have clouded our ability to see those times in color.</p>
<p>Much of that era&#8217;s Jewish history is captured in black and white photos from Europe. It gives rise to a sense that their time was one of darkness and sadness, devoid of color. Of course this is completely false. (In fact, many would counter that the black and white mode of dress common among many orthodox Jews is more doom and gloom than the the modes of dress present in the 19th and early 20th century.)</p>
<p>I happened upon a selection of absolutely stunning color photographs taken in Russia in the early 20th century before the world was thrust in upheaval during the First World War. The photos are in full technicolor<span id="more-2754"></span> and they tell a compelling story with almost garish colors and of people unaccustomed to photography<sup><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/27/a-beautiful-peek-into-our-history/#footnote_0_2754" id="identifier_0_2754" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Compare that to the era of camera phones and Facebook photo albums, we are ALWAYS taking photos and we know just how to behave and act when we are being photographed.

<p>The article shows 34 photos. They are all worthy of your attention. However, I call your attention to Photo #16. (click for full frame version)</p>

<p>This photo shows Jewish children studying with their teacher. I find it beautiful. The boys are attentive. They are wearing various styles of yarmulkas. The teacher looks regal. They are sharing their books. And the CLOTHES are amazing! This is a rare, colorful and bright view of a Jewish Education of a century ago.</p>
<p>Some of my great-grandparents were in &#8220;White Russia&#8221; in 1910. They may have known these boys, they may even be one of these boys.</p>
<p>I feel so blessed to have seen this picture and I am pleased to share it with you.</p>

It was Purim and they wanted to take pictures, talk with me and some of our Shul members and join in our Purim Celebration.</p>
<p>Never ones to turn down inviting strangers into the Shul, we welcomed them.</p>
<p>As I wrote at the time, our Purim Celebration was really special as we welcomed anyone and everyone off the boardwalk into our Shul. Read more here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/">Pacific Jewish Center Purim Celebration Recap February 28, 2010</a></p>
<p>Nancy took beautiful candid photos and David kind of blended in with the rest of us<span id="more-2382"></span> talking to us and learning about the Pacific Jewish Center and the festival of Purim.</p>
<p>Purim is a funny time to be introduced to new people. Things are a little different on Purim. But David managed to get to know us in a way that I never thought an outsider could.</p>
<p>Nancy and David produced a wonderful photo-film of their visit. It is part of their Escape Into America Series. The series is incredible. They have managed to find a lot of soul throughout their travels and it really comes through in their work.</p>
<p>In the photo-film about us, they did a really super job cutting through it all and finding the soul of our shul.</p>
<p>There are a couple things in the photo-film that are not perfectly precise, but that&#8217;s okay. (2 minor corrections: 1- I did mention to David that Purim costumes were likely borrowed for the Venice Carnival in the 15th Century and yet costumes fit in well with the themes of the day, 2- I am not sure I actually said that the Shul was in danger of disappearing &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t, rather, it could have been on that path).</p>
<p>Other than a couple minor mistakes the photo-film really captures the essence of Purim in our Shul as well as much of the essence of who we are at Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>The video stars everyone, but Yosef Beithalachmi (aka Mr. Pickles) and Ashi Bersin are featured in the voice-over. Great job!</p>

<p>This Purim, The Shul On The Beach opened its doors to the entire Venice / Santa Monica community to join in a Purim Celebration. An excellent turnout from our members, friends and neighbors set the stage for a truly memorable afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Beithalachmi prepared a wonderful Purim feast that was partially sponsored by Yossi and Joannie Ziff on the occasion of their second anniversary. As always, Jeff Liss planned an excellent party, including first class entertainment (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/28/alula-performs-at-pacific-jewish-center-purim-party-in-venice/" target="_blank">see the previous post</a>), refreshments and a costume contest. Most importantly, our community really stepped up to the plate in terms of hospitality, friendliness and warmth. Led, once again, by Rabbi Mintz, many, many guests were ushered into the Shul.<span id="more-2185"></span></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting neighbors who had simply never dropped by the Shul, Israelis on vacation, random folks on Venice Boardwalk who wanted to stop in, children, elderly people, Jews, non-Jews, religious and otherwise. We tried to take photos with as many people as possible and you can check out the slideshow of photos below. [If you have any photos to add, PLEASE email them to me and I will add them!]
<p>Guests enjoyed hamentaschen, the lively music and touring our Shul. As always, we enjoyed meeting so many people from so many different backgrounds and situations and sharing the joy of Purim with them.</p>
<p>There was a small contingency from the press (MSNBC.com) that joined us throughout Purim. They were at the reading of the Scroll of Esther on Purim evening and returned for the today&#8217;s celebration. It was so much fun getting to know them and sharing our Purim with them. We look forward to seeing the fruits of their labor sometime in April. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
<p>The gathering was lively and inspiring. I spoke briefly about the meaning of our commandment to remember Amalek. Amalek attacked the Jewish people just after the Exodus from Egypt. They focused their attack on the stragglers. I expressed my hope that as a community we would not allow any stragglers. We must be inclusive and help everyone to feel that they are in the center of the group. There can be no fringe group if we are to &#8220;defeat&#8221; Amalek. Today&#8217;s event was a strong step in that direction.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to all of you who helped and joined and made the event the festive celebration it was.</p>
<p>We are planning more events of this nature in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are all aware of the economic uncertainty in our country right now. A little while back, I wrote about how the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/28/tough-times-for-private-schools-and-yeshivas/" target="_blank">Yeshivas and Day Schools</a> for Jewish children and teens are being pinched.</p>
<p>Things are looking slightly improved since then. Unfortunately, the situation has not yet completely reversed course.</p>
<p>I have criticized the media in the past. It bothers me when the news that is reported is all negative and virtually ignores all the good in our world.</p>
<p>Once in a while there will be some &#8220;feel good&#8221; news story to push back the critics of negative media.</p>
<p>Today I saw a negative news item that was presented so well that I feel it is necessary to share. The point was made so well, with such class, professionalism and sensitivity that it was moving.</p>
<p><span id="more-503"></span>Take a short break from reading this post to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-imperial-valley-ss,0,2780390.htmlstory" target="_blank">watch this audio slideshow</a> from the LA Times. (It&#8217;s about 4 minutes.)</p>
<p>I will just wait here &#8217;til you are done.</p>
<p>Done?</p>
<p>What did you think? How do you feel?</p>
<p>This is the point at which the story traverses from media news item to documentary style art. When news is presented in such a powerful way it becomes art. I hope we see more news presented this way. (Although, it could be dangerously used if promoting hate or other universally negative ideals.)</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/05/where-the-wild-things-are/" target="_blank">As I have mentioned in the past</a>, I think when we are emotionally moved by anything we need to reflect on what we are feeling.</p>
<p>What I felt watching this slide show was pity. I feel so strongly for these people. I feel in many ways I am one of them. We never know what the future brings and we can only do our best. Those of us who are more secure in our positions in life must do whatever we can to alleviate the suffering of others. We also must be careful to avoid the harmful behaviors that caused this mess.</p>
<p>I would never want to feel the way the last character in the slideshow feels. It must be so terrible. I have a family and I never want to feel the way he does. It breaks my heart.</p>
<p>We need to be responsible and prudent to fix our economy. Quickly too. We will come out of this stronger and more viable than ever before.</p>
