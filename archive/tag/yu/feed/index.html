				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6787" alt="IMG_3104" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3104-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />R&#8217; Hershel Schachter whom I admire greatly, is in a bit of hot water. The Forward published an article that is misleading and inflammatory about R&#8217; Schachter.</p>
<p>The lede is particularly egregious: <em>&#8220;A top rabbinic dean of Yeshiva University has warned rabbis about the dangers of reporting child sex abuse allegations to the police because it could result in a Jew being jailed with a black inmate, or as he put it, “a schvartze,” who might want to kill him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Sounds pretty bad, huh? Well once you actually read the article you see that it&#8217;s not quite so simple.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go in reverse order.<span id="more-6786"></span> R&#8217; Schachter is not a racist. This is a certainty. He doesn&#8217;t have a negative bone in his body. He is one of the nicest, sweetest people I have ever met. He also speaks in yiddish a lot. When he says the &#8220;S&#8221; word, he does not mean it in a negative sense. He means it as the yiddish word for black person. There may be a little of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/11/r-manis-friedman-and-dov-hikind-explained/" target="_blank"><em>this</em></a> here as well. Sure, it sounds bad when he adds &#8220;who wants to kill him&#8221; but in all likelihood he was simply using an example, a poor example, of someone who would be in harm&#8217;s way if they went to jail. <em>(Edit: It&#8217;s pretty clear he was referring to the Nation of Islam as a potentially dangerous cell mate.)</em> More on that later.</p>
<p>A for the abuse and the reporting of abuse, the Forward totally hides the ball. For all his genius and piety, R&#8217; Schachter is a genuinely committed halachic Jew. He does everything in accordance with halacha and his approach is to show how halacha would handle any potential situation.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter is among the most liberal halachic authorities when it comes to reporting abuse or any other crime to the secular authorities. I was in the room when I heard him say that there is no prohibition of mesira today. (For more on mesira see this: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira in Halacha</a>.) This is a huge statement. One that the Forward should be championing. The primary obstacle to reporting abuse has classically been a misguided reliance on mesira. R&#8217; Schachter says there is no mesira. That&#8217;s huge. Pop the champagne.</p>
<p>However, in R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s opinion, one can&#8217;t go to the authorities unless one has something to report. Unless a victim can state facts with a fair amount of certainty, there is nothing to report. So if a victim comes forward and says &#8220;So and so abused me,&#8221; and there is reason to believe the victim, I am under the impression that R&#8217; Schachter holds that one is obligated to go to the authorities.</p>
<p>But the Forward doesn&#8217;t learn in a yeshiva. So the Forward doesn&#8217;t know that most of what we focus on in yeshiva are the non-obvious cases, the close calls, the cases that cut two ways or more. So R&#8217; Schachter spends considerable time on the borderline cases. He explains that when the veracity or factual basis of the claim is unclear you need to bring in professionals to assess the situation. That&#8217;s also the right idea! But it&#8217;s only in a small number of cases. Most cases are more clear cut. But in our Talmudic fashion, these abnormal cases become the focus of the discussion.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter sprinkles in an anecdote too. In the anecdote he is harsh to a possible victim. He advises the victim to go to a professional because he doesn&#8217;t have enough information to go to the authorities. The victim does not go. R&#8217; Schachter says that the victim is playing with fire. This is because more than anyone else, R&#8217; Schachter understands the gravity of allowing an abuser to run free.</p>
<p>So it is easy for the uninitiated to focus on this part of the conversation. The non-automatic cases. But that is a mistake. The primary points were already established: No mesira, if a victim comes forward go to the authorities. Sure, there are grey area cases and in those cases, one should try to figure out how to proceed using the best available professionals. This is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter also wants to show the gravity of a false accusation simply to show that halacha is concerned for everyone. The victim, the abuser, the falsely accused. All of them can be dealt with in the framework of halacha. Going to the authorities is very serious business. Halachically, we take responsibilty for what happens after we report abuse. We need to be careful and if we are careful, we must go to the authorities.</p>
<p>In my opinion, R&#8217; Schachter is one of our greatest authorities on this issue should be praised by the Forward, not maligned.</p>
<p><em>If you can&#8217;t see the difference between R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s situation and R&#8217; Manis Friedman&#8217;s and you need help, I am happy to assist you. But they have nothing to do with each other. Don&#8217;t even try to compare them.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6638" alt="Yeshiva-University1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Yeshiva-University1-295x300.jpg" width="295" height="300" />In the wake of the Weberman trial, the Forward published an expose on Yeshiva University, Rabbi Norman Lamm, and abusers George Finkelstein and Macy Gordon.</p>
<p>The relevant facts are that abuse of some sort was known to be taking place at MTA, the school did not report it, but eventually the abusers stopped working for the school. Nothing was publicized and nothing was reported. Rabbi Lamm knew about the abuse and decided to handle it privately. The extent of the abuse is unclear, but it seems that with one of the abusers was a sexualized version of wrestling, the other one is accused of far more heinous acts.</p>
<p>Rabbi Lamm, who is now 85, tried to explain YU&#8217;s lack of action. He said that things were different in those days. People didn&#8217;t quite know what to do about abuse.</p>
<p>It is easy to draw parallels between this case and the Weberman case. Both involved religious men who were accused of abuse. In both cases the religious institution protected its own interests and the interests of its employees over the safety of their students.</p>
<p>In some ways the YU case parallels the Penn State scandal as well. A very elderly statesman for a prestigious institution is embroiled in an abuse scandal for not taking care of the problem completely. The degree of abuse is different, and Rabbi Lamm didn&#8217;t enable the abusers, but there are some poignant similarities.</p>
<p>YU is guilty here. I believe that Rabbi Lamm could even face prosecution. Allowing abuse in our community is never acceptable.</p>
<p>But there are some very important distinctions between the Weberman case and the YU case.<span id="more-6637"></span></p>
<p>The most important distinction between YU and Satmar is the reaction of the community and the institution. YU has taken responsibility. YU apologized. YU has vowed to make sure this does not happen again. They have taken this on by the horns and are dealing with it appropriately.</p>
<p>Satmar has done nothing other than raise money for Weberman&#8217;s defense, publish articles blaming the media, terrorized witnesses and supporters of Weberman&#8217;s victim, and worst of all &#8211; not used this is an opportunity to educated their public about the horrors of abuse and ways to prevent it. It&#8217;s inexcusable, really.</p>
<p>To me, this makes a huge difference. It show that YU has learned from its mistakes and will do whatever it takes to prevent future abuse. YU will be a partner in ending abuse not a partner in perpetrating abuse. Satmar is the latter.</p>
<p>Some will argue, in defense of YU, that they didn&#8217;t really understand abuse back in the day and they thought it was best to deal with it privately. I think this is a terrible argument. Mandated reporting laws were passed precisely to educate the public and gatekeepers that they must report abuse. These laws are designed to take the decision out of the hands of the institution. YU ignored these laws (as far as I know) and pushed a predator out the door into some other institution. There is no excuse for ignorance. The law is clear.</p>
<p>In this respect, YU and Satmar are similar. Satmar is just 30 years behind. Well that&#8217;s to be expected. They are living in a recreation of 18th century eastern Europe. Of course they don&#8217;t get the horrors of abuse. But it&#8217;s not an excuse for Satmar in 2012 and similarly it is not an excuse for YU in 1985.</p>
<p>However, YU has clearly learned their lesson. This does give me a glimmer of hope that Satmar can learn their lesson too. But YU&#8217;s philosophy is to live in the present, Satmar&#8217;s philosophy is to recreate the past. YU celebrates science and research. Satmar demonizes it. This might prove a fatal flaw to by hope that Satmar will adjust. But if the Satmar community demands it and there is enough of an outcry over their disastrous record on abuse, maybe, just maybe Satmar can sheepishly follow in the footsteps of YU and enter the 21st century.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Julius-Berman.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6290" title="Julius-Berman" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Julius-Berman-217x300.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="300" /></a>Ami Magazine, which has been the subject of a couple pretty harsh blog posts on this blog, has a lovely interview with Julius Berman. I confess to not knowing the name Julius Berman before I read the interview and I am certain that most non-YU people that are around my age have not heard of him either.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame, because Julius Berman should be celebrated as a hero of American orthodox Judaism in the yeshiva world as well. He is a great example of what a good Torah Jew should strive to be. I know that I do.</p>
<p>I am very glad that Ami wrote the article and I am very glad I had a chance to read it. Everyone should read the full article.</p>
<p>There are a few things that I took away from the article that were beneath the surface of its substance.<span id="more-6289"></span></p>
<p>1) There are not a lot of people like Julius Berman. But the likelihood of another Julius Berman is becoming more remote. He is a man who has traversed the worlds of YU, the yeshiva world, and had genuine interaction with chasidic leaders. Those three worlds are become so much more independent and autonomous as time goes on. It will be difficult for younger people to follow Berman&#8217;s example.</p>
<p>2) I love how he didn&#8217;t want to write a <em>kvitel</em>. Over the last 25 years <em>chasidus</em> has mainstreamed to the point that most people would not think twice about writing a <em>kvitel.</em> Berman believed in his non-<em>chasidic </em>convictions enough to try to refuse a <em>kvitel.</em><em> </em>That impressed me.</p>
<p>3) My one critique is how the interview tried to blame the division between modern Orthodoxy and more right wing orthodoxy on the term Modern Orthodox and then blame the terminology on the modern Orthodox community. Let&#8217;s be real here, for better or for worse, the modern Orthodox community reveres, and relies on the right wing orthodox community. Not the other way around. It&#8217;s hard to pin the divisiveness on any one side, but certainly it is more of a stretch to pin it on the modern Orthodox community.</p>
<p>Overall the article was good. Kudos to Ami for taking the modern Orthodox plunge. It does not exonerate them for their prior sins (the ones we discussed on this blog are far from the only problems I am aware of&#8230;), but I am happy to see that they are trying to increase visibility for an important part of <em>Klal Yisrael. </em>I hope that this will help bridge the gaps that we have created for ourselves. At the very least, the right wing orthodox community will see a nice article that is a classic case of modern Orthodoxy presented in a positive light. Thank you for that.</p>
<p>Read the article. It&#8217;s good. Click the link for a link to a PDF of the article.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RichardJoelHeadshot.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6253" title="RichardJoelHeadshot" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RichardJoelHeadshot-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>Contrary to popular belief, I did not attend Yeshiva University. I&#8217;ve only been there four times in my life. Once for a concert, twice for a video job, and once for the Seforim Sale in 2001 (I bought a Tzidkas HaTzadik and a fancy Mesillas Yesharim). But as I have evolved through my adult years, I have come to learn that I share a considerable amount with YU in many respects.</p>
<p>This is not entirely surprising as the Yeshivas that I attended are not that far off from YU in terms of their overall worldview. With the recent shifts to the right across orthodox Judaism, YU is now very near the style of Judaism in which I was raised.</p>
<p>I was offered the opportunity to interview President Joel as a follow up to his State of the University address which was masterfully delivered at YU last night. President Joel is even better on the phone than he is behind the podium and I really enjoyed our conversation. We discussed a variety of topics that are of interest to the readers of this blog and while I didn&#8217;t transcribe every word of our conversation, I did take notes. What follows is a synopsis of the more compelling parts of our conversation.</p>
<p>What jumped out at me during the State of the University Address was President Joel&#8217;s use of the term Modern Orthodox L&#8217;Chatchila.<span id="more-6251"></span> I too have discussed this topic and am a firm believer that the most perfect Jew is one who is passionate about Torah and scholarship in Torah while being engaged in the outside world. In our conversation, President Joel expanded on this by explaining that Torah U&#8217;Mada can be a very sterile approach. The new approach is Shleimus, the complete person. The idea is that Torah is not supposed to be practiced in an Ir Miklat (city of refuge), it is supposed to be a launching pad. While Torah U&#8217;Mada is part of that philosophy, it became associated with certain apologetics. The modified approach is that Torah U&#8217;Mada is an aspiration, not one specific approach for those who can&#8217;t hack more insular versions of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>This relates to the idea of the Big Tent that President Joel spoke of. There has to be a place for as many people as possible to fit under the tent. In his words, Jews are better at division than multiplication. It&#8217;s a cute line, but also rings true. Although, in my opinion <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/">There is No Tent</a>.</p>
<p>We also discussed the basic dichotomy of insularity vs. engagement. President Joel echoed my thoughts when he described the history of Ashkenazi Jewry. We didn&#8217;t have the option of engagement for most of those years. Our ideal was simply to survive. Survival meant physical and spiritual survival. But President Joel said that the Torah wants us to thrive, not merely survive. Thriving means to engage. There are risks to engagement. The tightrope is difficult to walk. But the view from that tightrope is supremely grand. He compared it to the seven branched menorah with the six lights on the sides pointing toward the middle.</p>
<p>President Joel acknowledged that there are people who leave modern Orthodoxy just like there are people who leave more insular groups. It&#8217;s not a solution as much as an alternative. But the main factors according to President Joel are not philosophy or worldview. The main factors are the home, education, and as he puts it &#8211; mazel. In many respects, society is antithetical to Torah and its values. We need passion and intellectual Judaism to survive that threat.</p>
<p>I told President Joel that even where I come from, the leftmost edge of the yeshiva world, YU is usually a topic of derision. I asked President Joel if he had a message for those on the right that look askance at YU. He began his response by making it very clear that they have respect for the entire Jewish community. To the right and to the left. He invited anyone to come to the Beis Medrash and see that it is comparable to any great yeshiva throughout the world. He said you&#8217;ll find 600 guys learning lishma at night seder. The Roshei Yeshiva are all very significant Torah scholars. They also have degrees. 60% have Masters and 20% have a Ph.D. He volunteered that they don&#8217;t treat Gemara like a college course. Torah is Torah and it is primary. He offered anyone who wants to see it in person to come and wear a mask if they want. But they will see that despite some hashkafic differences, YU is mehadrin when it comes to commitment to Torah learning.</p>
<p>My follow up question was whether YU was doing or considering doing &#8220;kiruv&#8221; on the charedim to try and engage charedim and bring more charedim to YU. He responded that the economic realities are making YU a more attractive option. People need to earn a living now more than ever before and YU gives young people a chance to continue their learning and lay the foundation for a parnassah. Additionally, YUTorah.org gets 75,000 hits a month. Whenever he meets charedim people tell him they love YUTorah.org. Through Torah there is more of a connection than ever before. <a href="http://efink.tumblr.com/post/30917612411/maimonides-is-a-bit-like-a-trojan-horse-of-reason" target="_blank">To borrow a term</a>, YUTorah.org is like the YU Trojan Horse into the charedi world. President Joel is in contact with charedi leaders but he gets the sense that there is not much interest on their part. But he noted that there are fewer attacks against YU these days. I think that might have to do with the new charedi whipping boy YCT. But President Joel ended this part of our conversation by reiterating that he really believes Eilu v&#8217;Eilu applies here. He would love for recruitment to go to more charedi high schools and they have started to do that a little bit. The big tent includes the right and the left.</p>
<p>Our last two topics were more specific. I asked President Joel about Orthopraxy and those leaving Chasidic Judaism. First Orthopraxy. President Joel was very familiar with the phenomenon but began by saying that Orthopraxy is better than nothing. Mitoch shelo lishma, bah lishmah. He believes that the Education School is dealing with this on a broad scale. Passionless Judaism is a huge challenge. But he felt that there is plenty of passion at YU. President Joel led the first night of slichos with 1000 people in attendance. When he began with Ashrei Yoshvei Veisecha, the roar of the people joining him in prayer was very inspiring. There is a richness of passion at YU and he believes that this is helpful in avoiding Orthopraxy. But in the end, Judaism is more about deed than creed and the primary concern is with mitzvah not emunah. Certainly Judaism cannot be transmitted without spirituality and God, it must be linked with the Divine to thrive, but our focus is on action, not belief. But there is very little that is specifically targeting Orthopraxy and Atheism at YU and President Joel said the point was well taken and perhaps should be addressed more directly.</p>
<p>Finally we got to the ex-Chasids. I told him about my friends in real life and online that left chasidic Judaism. For a lot them, the Chasidic world was a very fragile bubble and once that bubble burst, the only place to go was out. Out meant, out of orthodox Judaism entirely. Personally, I think that many ex-Chasids would be very happy and very successful modern Orthodox Jews. But there is no track from Chasidic insularity to YU. I asked if YU could somehow market itself as an attractive alternative to insular life in the Chasidic world and perhaps provide a soft landing for ex-Chasids. He agreed that this was a great idea, but said that there is nothing like that happening right now. He did say that when Dr. Pelcovitz speaks to charedim and chasidic Jews he always says that he is a professor at YU. The idea is to present YU to them in a way that they may acknowledge its existence positively. This is a tiny step, but an important one. Professor Joel invited me to email him about this idea and discuss it further. I look forward to that opportunity and hope to make good on my suggestion in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>.</p>
<p>I had a wonderful time talking with President Joel and I hope to continue our conversation in the future. Thank you President Joel for your time and the opportunity to get to know YU on a personal level.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DoctorCartoon.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5542" title="DoctorCartoon" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DoctorCartoon-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a>Yeshiva University Museum, (I had no idea that there was such a place,) is hosting an exhibit on Jewish doctors. You know the famous joke about the inauguration of the first Jewish president? His mother is in the front row sitting next to her old Jewish lady friends and as the president-elect gets up on the podium, she tells her friend, ya know, his brother is a Doctor!</p>
<p>Yes, there is a Jewish doctor stereotype, but this article on the NY Times about the exhibit gives us a clue as to how this happened. Judaism does not view medicine as heretical or an affront to religion. On the contrary, the doctor is considered the emissary of God and an ally in the healing process.</p>
<p>Judaism does not allow people to rely on God for Divine Intervention or a miracle in lieu of seeking professional medical help. There is no faith healing or reluctance to seek human intervention in Judaism. And so, a culture of favoring medicine over faith is intrinsic to the Jewish experience. In fact, one of the most influential and important Jewish scholars of all time was Maimonides. He was a physician as well as a scholar.<span id="more-5540"></span></p>
<p>My grandfather was a medical consultant by trade. He was the president of Laniado Hospital in Netanya, Israel. He was the person who built the hospital and brought the Klausenberg Rebbe&#8217;s dream into reality. He was very fond of quoting the Rebbe in this regard. When someone would come to the Rebbe for a blessing or advice, before anything else the Rebbe would ask &#8220;<em>Vos zugt der doctor</em>&#8221; &#8211; what does the doctor say.</p>
<p>This was to reinforce the message that health and sickness are very dependent on what the doctor says and what the doctor does.</p>
<p>Of course, the exhibition will also highlight some of the anti-Semitism that Jewish doctors have faced over the last few hundred years. At one point, Catholics were not permitted to seek medical help from a Jewish doctor. Sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>If you are in New York, you might find the exhibit interesting. I hope I will be able to see it some time over the summer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Craigslist-Censored400x320.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5272" title="Craigslist-Censored400x320" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Craigslist-Censored400x320-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a><em>(Also posted on DovBear: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2012/03/tznius-inflation.html" target="_blank">Tznius Inflation</a>)</em></p>
<p>I read this excellent article on Tablet today. It&#8217;s a great article for a lot of reasons. For me, the best part of the article is that I agree with almost every word! (Half kidding.) For the purposes of this post I will assume you have also read the article. Click here: <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/93971/tights-squeeze" target="_blank">Tablet Magazine</a>, read the article and come back when you are done.</p>
<p>The writer, a young woman studying at Stern College, comes from a more insular background than the Yeshiva University environment she now associates with. Her accounts of life in the more insular community are accurate and I myself have experienced many of the same sentiments first hand. I have heard of almost all the rest of them second hand.<span id="more-5271"></span></p>
<p>The single most important indicator of religious piety has become modesty. If that sounds ironic, it is because it is. Real modesty is to shift the focus from the external to the internal. The obsession with modesty has turned it into the very opposite of modesty.</p>
<p>I recently heard that a woman was &#8220;off the derech&#8221;. The proof was that she was seen in pants and only covering most of her hair with a hat. Why is that the deciding factor? And why are we talking about it?</p>
<p>Tznius has also turned into an arms race. The more stringent we can be with our children and communities, the more safe we feel in our observance. I don&#8217;t need to tell tales or name names, but my observation has been that the standards have increased to less reasonable levels in my own lifetime. Women being blurred out of photos, advertisements telling women to hide on Purim, summer camps for young children with only girls present are expected to have strict dress codes are all recent examples that I have seen of tznius inflation.</p>
<p>The article expresses an almost hesitant appreciation for secular wisdom and art. That is unfortunate but understandable. In the yeshiva world, beauty is found in Judaism and Torah. Searching for beauty and wisdom elsewhere is discouraged and frowned upon. I don&#8217;t think this is the way of truth. Our great Torah giants from almost all previous generations venerated all wisdom. We should as well.</p>
<p>I hope the article goes viral. I hope everyone reads the article. The insular community should see how it is perceived by those who leave it but remain true to orthodox Judaism. In fact, I wish the YU style community and yeshivish community could somehow bridge the gap and find more common ground. I see YU shifting to the right, but almost as if to one-up them, the more insular community has taken its own turn to the right. If the communal standards were less rigid, I think we would find that there is beauty in both ways of life. But it can be hard to see the beauty when it feels to many as if beauty must be repressed and hidden.</p>
<p>Great article Avital. I hope to read more of your writing in the future!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/logo.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4898" title="logo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/logo-300x73.png" alt="" width="300" height="73" /></a>Several online news publications reported on the YU Beacon controversy from this past week. The Beacon is a student newspaper at Yeshiva University. It is a student voice for Yeshiva College and Stern College.</p>
<p>The controversy arose from a particular article that was authored anonymously. I will not get into the details of the content of the article. Generally, it was about a young woman studying at Stern who lapsed in her observance in a hotel room with a fellow observant Jewish male. The article&#8217;s entire point was that while it may have been exhilarating, it was shameful and she was full of regret.</p>
<p>An objective reading of the article would lead to several conclusions.<span id="more-4897"></span></p>
<p>1) There is a tension in the YU community regarding intimacy before marriage.<br />
2) There are some people who breach the barriers of halacha and are intimate before marriage.<br />
3) The culture of YU does not &#8220;accept&#8221; this as normative behavior and it is considered shameful.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t find any of these conclusions to be super offensive. I don&#8217;t think they place Jews in a poor light. I don&#8217;t think they place Modern Orthodox Jews in particular in a bad light either.</p>
<p>What happened next complicated things.</p>
<p>Apparently, MANY students complained that this article was offensive. It was pulled temporarily. After a meeting between the student council, The Beacon editors and some YU administrators, the article was reposted with a disclaimer and The Beacon is now independent of YU.</p>
<p>The next level of analysis that always follows instances such as these is &#8211; Was this a kiddush Hashem or a Chillul Hashem?</p>
<p>The answer is both. And neither. Every part of the story has nuances that can be interpreted as positive and negative. Which means, that like most things controversial, it cannot be decided by one metric. I don&#8217;t use the words Kiddush and Chillul Hashem willy nilly, instead I will just use the words positive and negative. What follows is my personal analysis.</p>
<p><em>DISCLAIMERs: I am not a YU alum. I have never even been to the Yeshiva part of the University. I have been the High School twice and to the Seforim sale once. Also, I have written for The Beacon.</em></p>
<p>The article was titillating. It was in a YU publication. I think that may have been negative. A school newspaper should reflect the student body. Much of the student body does not want erotica in their newspaper. The article could have been interpreted as erotica.</p>
<p>But the message was positive. I think that is clear. The message is that we all struggle. We all feel guilty when we fail. But most of all, we all try to pick ourselves up and stay true to the values in our community based on Torah.</p>
<p>Taking down the article in response to outrage was also positive. A student newspaper should reflect the mores and mentality of the student body. When it fails to do so, it should reconsider publishing the offending material. In this case, the outrage was so severe that it warranted removal.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would have been more prudent, mature and wise not get so worked up over the article. But college students can be very headstrong. Their minds were made. I think the outrage was a negative.</p>
<p>But the end game was completely dissatisfying. The Beacon dug in its heels standing up for some moral principle and refused to back down in the face of bullies. The student council did not back down either. They forced the Beacon&#8217;s hand. Both sides were stubborn and both sides reflected negatively.</p>
<p>Where is the publicity over this? On which point is the media focusing? That is the key question. If it is simply noting the stubbornness of two student organizations then that is clearly a negative portrayal. But if the media&#8217;s focus is on the more mature and positive elements of this story, I think we can say that we are neutral at worst and positive at best. In that case, perhaps there was a Kiddush Hashem here. Perhaps.</p>
<p>As for me, I wouldn&#8217;t have published the article. I also would not have complained if the article were published.</p>
<p>A note on censorship and freedom of the press: In an environment that mixes secular and religious values as YU claims to do, sometimes one of those value systems must trump the other. If the religious value system says that publication is not wise, then you can can cry freedom of the press and marketplace of ideas as much as you want, but in the end, sometimes religion wins out. Sometimes, freedom of speech loses to restrictions of religion. I agree that a conversation about the content of the article is a good thing. I don&#8217;t know that the manner in which this article was executed was perfect nor do I think the negativity towards it was perfect either.</p>
<p>I do hope that the article will serve its purpose. I hope that it will promote discussion and discourse on this very important issue and that after all is said and done we will all emerge wiser, more devout and committed to our religious values.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Sanhedrin.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4508" title="Sanhedrin" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Sanhedrin-300x270.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="270" /></a>Today&#8217;s New York Times presents a fascinating argument made by Dr. Schnall from YU.</p>
<p>Schnall argues that the ancient Jewish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin" target="_blank">Sanhedrin</a> built into its system a foil to the fatal flaws of &#8220;groupthink&#8221;. Groupthink explains how otherwise very intelligent people can make terrible decisions as a group. Often, members of a group defer to others and they lose their voice even when they might disagree with the majority or group leaders. Without voices of dissent, even groups can make disastrous decisions.</p>
<p>The Sanhedrin had rules that forced the group out of groupthink. First and foremost, any unanimous decision regarding a capital case was discarded. Other minor rules also did their part. For example, junior members spoke first so that their opinions would original and not be influenced by the elders. Dr. Schnall cites many other examples from the Sanhedrin&#8217;s rules that he claims are helpful in avoiding groupthink.<span id="more-4507"></span></p>
<p>On the Times website they leave this question hanging for their readers:</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think? </strong>Is a unanimous decision a sign of a slam dunk or overwhelming groupthink?</em></p>
<p>While I find that question interesting, I am more interested in whether our current Daas Torah style of rabbinic leadership might be suffering from some sort of groupthink? <span style="font-size: x-small;">(Yes, this might offensive to people who believe that rabbis are not human and do not ever make mistakes but per my tradition from my rabbis and teachers this is a perfectly acceptable position, thankyouverymuch.)</span> I wonder, is there dissent in the Moetzes? Do the rabbis disagree with one another? Or do they all defer to the leadership? Much in the same way that those who live and breathe by every word uttered from their mouths? Is it possible that they disagree in private and present a united front in their public statements? Yes. But wouldn&#8217;t we all feel more confident if we knew that for certain?</p>
<p>I know it is a cop out to ask open-ended questions on a blog and not answer them (ahem, NY Times Arts Beat). But in this case, I just don&#8217;t know. I have my suspicions but I have no way to confirm them. It is, however, worthwhile food for thought.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/yeshiva.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3421" title="yeshiva university" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/yeshiva-295x300.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="240" /></a>As if the YU Maccabeats weren&#8217;t giving YU enough press (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/12/03/this-years-hottest-chanukah-song-candlelight-by-the-maccabeats-jewish-holiday-music/">This Year’s Hottest Chanukah Song: Candlelight by The Maccabeats | Jewish Holiday Music</a>), the YU Maccabees (basketball team) got some nice press last week as well.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal has a nice piece on Dr. Jonathan Halpert. He is the YU basketball coach of 39 years. That is a long time to be doing any job. Certainly in a field dominated by the coaching carousel, it is a worthy achievement.</p>
<p>The article is nice. It tells of the challenges of managing a team of Orthodox Jewish basketball players. Shabbos and Holidays are off limits to games and practices. The daily grind of a YU student includes religious studies until mid afternoon and then secular classes that can go until 8 PM.</p>
<p>Halpert gives the reader insight into his coaching and life philosophy and as a reader I found him to be inspiring.<span id="more-3420"></span></p>
<p>In the article, there is one anecdote about making an impact on a player&#8217;s life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There was the player who was cut but served as team manager for a year, made the squad the following season and hit a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. Dr. Halpert made five DVDs of the game for the player to show to his children. &#8220;That&#8217;s good to keep you going another five years,&#8221; he said.</em></p>
<p>A nice story. But even nicer because I happen to know that player.</p>
<p>That player is Aryeh Magilnick. Son of PJC members <strong>Judd</strong> and <strong>Denise Magilnick</strong>.</p>
<p>And I happen to know what shot Halpert was referring to. And now you do too.</p>
<p>Click the video to watch Aryeh Magilnick hit a classic buzzer beater. (Assume there is a buzzer and that the shot was released just before the buzzer sounded.)</p>

<p>A cute news item has been circulating the Jewish internets recently. I have seen links to the NY Times story on Twitter, Facebook, VIN and YWN.</p>
<p>I was tipped off by my friend who works at <a href="http://twitter.com/YUNews" target="_blank">YU media relations</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/from-wind-light-for-the-menorah/?scp=1&amp;sq=menorah&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">NY Times</a> picked up on a story about a student duo at Yeshiva University who made a very unique Chanukah menorah. Raffi Holczer and Mark Stauber are physics students and they spent 2 weeks making a different kind of menorah.<span id="more-1824"></span></p>
<p>This menorah is powered by a battery that is powered by a windmill. The whole set up is pretty cool. What caught my eye was their &#8220;drasha&#8221; on the Chanukah story.</p>
<p>As the story goes, the Maccabees wrestled the Temple from Greek rule and wished to light the lamps. Temple lamps can only be lit with ritually pure oil, none of which would be available for 8 days. A small jug of oil was found. It would only last for one day and the lamp would go dark after the one day. Miraculously, the oil lasted for the 8 days.</p>
<p>One of the duo, Mark Stauber, offers a very nice lesson to be taken from the aforementioned Chanukah story. In his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“In the miracle of the menorah, they got back to the temple and there was only enough oil for one night, but they made it last eight days,” he said. “I see an analogy with the world’s fight for sustainable energy, to take that and make it last as long as we’re going to need it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Managing and maintaining our natural resources is definitely something the Torah teaches us. From Jacob lingering to save a few small vessels (according to the Midrash) to the prohibition of destroying fruit trees. The Torah has been teaching &#8220;Green&#8221; for thousands of years.</p>
<p>I wrote about Torah and ecology on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/22/earth-day/" target="_blank">Earth Day</a> and the next day in my <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/15/green-post/" target="_blank">Green Post</a>. It is a universal, non-denominational, non-partisan lesson about care and concern for the earth we inhabit.</p>
<p>I like the application of the principal to the Chanukah story.</p>
<p>These young men are also taking the idea of &#8220;Or L&#8217;amim&#8221; &#8211; light to the nations, to another level. They are using &#8220;light&#8221; to be that &#8220;light&#8221;.</p>
<p>Great job!</p>
<p>They also scored a gig on NBC News. Video is below.</p>
