				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/imposter.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4132" title="imposter" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/imposter.jpg?resize=300%2C229" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Ami Magazine has an article about orthoprax Jews. I&#8217;m not one to complain about tone, so I won&#8217;t complain. I will just note for the record that the tone of the article is incredibly demeaning to anyone who has ever contemplated the limits of religious belief and the article sounds more like a scathing editorial than a piece of journalism.</p>
<p>In order to understand this blog post <strong>it is necessary that you read the Ami Magazine article</strong> which is available here: <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/52858246/Ami-Magazine-April-6-2011-The-Impostors-Among-Us" target="_blank">The Impostors Among Us</a>. Come back here when you are done.</p>
<p>The concept of orthopraxy is a simple one. Act like an orthodox Jew but reject some or all of the beliefs of orthodox Judaism. To the author of this article, these people are impostors and the biggest threat to orthodox Judaism that exists.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with the article is the approach taken with regard to orthopraxy in general.<br />
<span id="more-4130"></span>In the eyes of the author, one who questions their core beliefs as an Orthodox Jew is literally sick. Either emotionally scarred or intellectually weak describes the types of people who are orthoprax. The assumption is that any sane, intelligent person would obviously conclude that the core beliefs of orthodox Judaism are correct. Further, those beliefs are to believed in their most absolute fundamental form.</p>
<p>However, the article does not, in any way shape or form, actually address the complaints that orthoprax Jews raise against those beliefs. It just assumes that those beliefs are reasonable. To me, this is representative of the flaws that created this problem and the incomptence within the fold in dealing with these issues.</p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism requires certain beliefs. The article, and most orthodox Jews I know, assume that these beliefs are obvious, logical, reasoned conclusions. They possess this belief because they have not been presented any evidence to the contrary. And if they have been presented evidence to the contrary it has been tainted and manipulated by apologists who spin the evidence as non-compelling while only presenting half-truths. Thus, when the soon-to-be-orthopraxer actually is presented with real evidence or questions that poke holes in the once so compelling logic of the orthodox Jewish beliefs, the house of cards comes crashing down.</p>
<p>The primary defense against the destructive nature of this information has been seclusion. This defense (as the article calls it, I wouldn&#8217;t call it a defense) is not a defense at all. It is avoiding the problems. When someone avoids a problem or skirts an issue the natural reaction is to believe that there is no real answer, there is no solution, the questions are too powerful and the previously held beliefs are not defensible. The next reasonable step is to lose faith in the system.</p>
<p>It is not an illness. It is not the result of emotionally damaged psychosis. It is normal.</p>
<p>If we believe that we possess some sort of truth, then we can&#8217;t be afraid of other truths. If we are hiding from other truths, it betrays our lack of confidence in our truth. This kind of hypocrisy and closed-mindedness is what causes people to drop their beliefs. Not disease.</p>
<p>The trick is to realize that this is the problem. Once this is established the beginnings of some solutions are not too far out of reach.</p>
<p>The article suggests attending &#8220;emunah workshops&#8221;. There cannot be a worse idea. First of all, emunah is entirely inappropriate a word for these workshops. They are not teaching emunah, faith. They teach quasi-intellectual proofs (which mostly have counter proofs or flaws) in order to prove the divinity of the Torah or the existence of God. These are the very &#8220;proofs&#8221; that lead to orthopraxy. They reek of chicanery and feel like mind games. If you ask a question that derails the flow, again, the whole house of cards comes crashing down. If one tries to prove something and the proof fails miserably, one is worse off than if one had not tried to prove it at all. It makes the one trying to do the proving look like a snake oil salesman. No one intelligent is going to buy snake oil.</p>
<p>Instead, I think, the solution should be an expanded, more liberal interpretation of Torah M&#8217;Sinai and God. The system needs to give leeway for the varied opinions throughout our tradition that take less of a hard line approach. Don&#8217;t build that massive house of cards. Try to reintroduce the valid opinions of our great sages that are more compatible with evidence that we now have. That&#8217;s not to say that those who had opinions that don&#8217;t comport with what we know today were wrong. They were doing the best they could with the information they had. We should strive to do the same.</p>
<p>Further, there is nothing wrong and there is no reason to attach a stigma to those who have questions. Orthodox Jewish beliefs are not necessarily logical conclusions. Assuming they are and assuming that one who does not reach those same conclusions is a handicapped person, fosters an environment where orthopraxy is sometimes the only choice. But if allowing ourselves to have unresolved questions would be an acceptable place within orthodox Judaism, fewer people would feel the need to jump ship.</p>
<p>The article implies that these impostors must be rooted out and exposed. This is offensive to me. I am sure plenty of great people throughout our storied history have questioned their beliefs. After all, the Rambam wrote a &#8220;Guide for the Perplexed&#8221;. Some people must have been perplexed! I am even more certain that many great people had a parent or two who may have questioned their beliefs. It is also likely that some who questioned, eventually rejected. But I am sure many others either resigned to not knowing or found some satisfaction in the answers they discovered. By exposing, stigmatizing and rooting out anyone who questions their beliefs we are playing with fire. People change their ideas throughout their lives and many who don&#8217;t can still raise children who can sustain their own beliefs and be successful orthodox Jews. Ruining lives and shunning people who don&#8217;t think the same way others think is a witch hunt of the worst kind. How can others measure the thoughts of a peer? Thoughts are not measurable by man. Only actions are. <em>(On the importance of action versus thought I recommend Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s post: <a href="http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2011/04/ominous-treacherous-infiltrators.html">Ominous, Treacherous Infiltrators?</a>)</em></p>
<p>I believe there is one more area of contemporary orthodox Judaism that significantly contributes to orthopraxy. That is the abundance of mysticism within our community. There are people who are skeptics. It is their nature. These people are not intrigued or impressed with mysticism. If it is not logical or scientific it simply doesn&#8217;t appeal to them. However, the Judaism of Rambam or R&#8217; Hirsch <em>would</em> be very appealing to them. Judaism of 2011 may not. Mysticism requires suspension of disbelief. It is easy to see how one can conflate the unnecessary belief in mysticism with the necessary beliefs of orthodox Judaism. Stop believing (or never believing) in one leads to the other. Making mysticism such an integral part of orthodox Judaism will have a negative affect on those who are skeptics and unnecessarily so. The Judaism of Rambam and R&#8217; Hirsch was passionate and deep without many of the things that would turn a skeptic away from Judaism. I believe that part of the problem is that too much suspension of disbelief can turn some of our best and brightest into sacrifices burned at the altar of mysticism.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the Internet. The article suggests that the Internet is to blame for orthopraxy. While this might be partially true, it does not exonerate the community for pushing these people out. The lack of preparation for discovering new information, the level of misinformation that is taught and the expectation that no one will ever find anything that contradicts the party line are all just as much to blame, if not more, than the actual information that bursts these bubbles.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>There are many other ways to approach this article. I believe there are other flaws in the article as well. I have chosen to highlight some of the issues I feel need addressing and may not be addressed by others. As always, I welcome your thoughts and feelings on the article and my musings in the comments.</p>
<p>The article has at least succeeded in providing food for thought. It is an article that has spawned many more articles and conversations. That is a credit to the writer. Hopefully, together, we can work these problems through in a sensible and pleasant manner that will benefit the greater good.</p>

But in the time since I wondered on April 16, 2010  if there were any Orthroprax Rabbis (read: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/16/orthoprax-jews-and-orthoprax-christians/">Orthoprax Jews and Orthoprax Christians</a>), an Orthoprax Rabbi has come out of the proverbial closet.</p>
<p>Boy did he set off a firestorm. Hundreds of comments on his blog, another few hundred on the other blogs talking about the Orthoprax Rabbi confirm the provocativeness of the idea of an orthoprax rabbi.</p>
<p>I have a lot to say ABOUT the Orthoprax Rabbi and I also have some things to say TO the Orthoprax Rabbi (IF HE IS REAL AND NOT A HOAX).<span id="more-2582"></span></p>
<p>Here are some preliminary thoughts:</p>
<p>&gt;Technically, it seems like the Orthoprax Rabbi is not really Orthoprax. He <a href="http://theorthopraxrabbi.wordpress.com/2010/06/17/about-me/" target="_blank">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I personally don’t keep much of any of Jewish law.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that kind of disqualifies you from being Orthoprax. The &#8220;prax&#8221; part of it requires that you keep at least most of Jewish Law. So, while he claims to the the Orthoprax Rabbi, apparantly he is not. He is more like an Orthodox Rabbi in public and non-practicing Jew on the inside.</p>
<p>So, while he calls himself the Orthoprax Rabbi, I am still wondering if there is a genuinely orthoprax rabbi who adheres to the &#8220;prax&#8221; / halacha but does not adhere to the &#8220;dox&#8221; / beliefs of Judaism.</p>
<p>&gt;While I can appreciate the desire to expose this person, I find the witch hunt distasteful.</p>
<p>It is especially distasteful in comparison to the lack of witch hunt against pedophiles and molesters in the orthodox community. In fact, not only is there NO witch hunt against those &#8220;witches&#8221;, some still protect them.</p>
<p>I am not saying that any time people want to try to root out evil from their community they should be stopped because of their failures in other areas. What I am saying is that those who try to expose the Orthoprax Rabbi are really exposing THEMSELVES as people who care more about regulating others beliefs than regulating sex crimes. That is sad and wrong.</p>
<p>&gt;And to the (misnamed) Orthoprax Rabbi I say:</p>
<p>You say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I don’t believe in any of it. I am an atheist.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Have you considered the following? For some people it is not natural to believe in a God. For some people belief in God is irrational. For some people atheism may be more reasonable than belief in a deity. Yet, there can be value and beauty in a life that does belief in a God.</p>
<p>In other words, while science and academia provide insight into the rationality of belief in God, there are scientifically immeasurable reasons to hold onto your religion. In many respects, Judaism works. But its working really depends on one&#8217;s adherence to the mitzva of believing in God. You don&#8217;t have to buy into the mysticism, you just need to be willing to suspend your disbelief enough to believe in God. If you can do that, you are not really Orthoprax at all.</p>
<p>I hope you can pull that off. I think if you can do that, your voice will be another valuable voice in the Orthodox ranks.</p>

<p>The article is a Boston Globe piece and is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/04/11/the_unbelievers/?page=full">The Unbelievers</a>&#8220;. I recommend reading the entire article as this post will just highlight a few parts of the well researched article to illustrate some points of interest to this audience.</p>
<p>Lately, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk of Orthopraxy within the Orthodox Jewish world. See my post: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/11/the-real-orthoprax-issue/">The Real Orthoprax Issue</a>. There are even some blogs dedicated to its theology (and challenging the traditional OJ theology). Interestingly, the Orthoprax people I know of (NOT Orthoprax by default) are lay people. Not Rabbis.<span id="more-2367"></span> True, they are very learned and could probably pass as rabbis, but they remain lay people. Though I wonder if there are &#8220;closet Orthoprax Rabbis&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>According to this article, there are significant clergy members of various Christian denominations that for all practical purposes are &#8220;Orthoprax Christians&#8221;. They value the rituals, the connection with others, the music, but they don&#8217;t believe their religion&#8217;s theology. They don&#8217;t believe in God.</p>
<p>When comparing ministers and Christianity with Rabbis and Judaism there is a marked difference. Almost all Orthodox Jews spend several years of Torah study. Many lay people in the OJ community are more learned than their Rabbis. The article led me to believe that it is highly unlikely that lay people in the Christian community would be &#8220;Orthoprax Christians&#8221; because they don&#8217;t know enough about the Bible and Christianity for the gaping holes, flaws and problems to bother them. But the educated class, the clergy, is susceptible to disbelief because they know what the problems are</p>
<p>Cynics have said that the reason for &#8220;Daas Toyrah&#8221; ousting rationalism and &#8220;Slifkinism&#8221; from the &#8220;mesorah&#8221; is to keep the public ignorant so that they won&#8217;t revolt against the rabbis. Perhaps there is some truth to that cynical belief. Ignorance will definitely keep people in line. It also shows is a complete lack of confidence in Torah.</p>
<p>Reading through the article I noticed little things that are virtually the exact ideas that Orthoprax Jews talk about. One idea is the &#8220;more benign forms of religion&#8221;. That is a religion without God. It takes the moral aspects of religion and the rituals but divorces them from divinity and yet brings people together. Another idea is the issue of who wrote the Bible. Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t usually struggle with this. But those who are aware of the issues, do.</p>
<p>In short, this article is not written about Jews. But it very likely could have been. It seems to me that there is nearly endless room for discussion about the questions it raises for us. I urge you to read the article and think about how it makes you feel.</p>
<p>The article made me feel confused about how I feel. How about you?</p>

<p>Rabbi Steven Pruzansky is making headlines with <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/42879" target="_blank">his front page Jewish Press article in which he thoroughly disposes of Orthopraxy and ousts the Orthoprax from Modern Orthodoxy</a>.</p>
<p>For a thorough fisking of the main parts of the article <a href="http://modernorthoprax.blogspot.com/2010/03/is-rabbi-steven-pruzansky-idiot.html" target="_blank">go to XGH&#8217;s blog</a>, this is his area of expertise.</p>
<p>What Rabbi Pruzansky&#8217;s article made me ponder is the relevance of Orthopraxy to the average Frum Jew. <span id="more-2254"></span>In my opinion there are two kinds of Orthoprax Jews. There are Orthoprax theologians and Orthoprax by Default. The theologians are those that &#8220;believe&#8221; in Orthopraxy. <a href="http://modernorthoprax.blogspot.com" target="_blank">XGH</a> and <a href="http://orthoprax.blogspot.com" target="_blank">others</a><em> are the most vocal of this group.</em> This is the group Rabbi Pruzansky heaps his disdain upon. He blames them for all of the problems he sees in his community and seems to think that if you sin, it must be because really you are Orthoprax. You must be the &#8220;non-believer in our midst&#8221;. It is unseemly, and I do not wish to address his comments. <em>(It&#8217;s ironic because the Orthoprax, by dint of their theology value the acts of Judaism MORE than the beliefs of Judaism. While the Orthodox need to balance the two and one could be Orthodox and still sin all the time. That is why we have Yom Kippur and the mitzva of Teshuva. In other words, I would expect an Orthodox Jew to sin at least as often as an Orthoprax. But I digress.)</em></p>
<p>I think that within the Frum spectrum, from LWMO all the way through RW Yeshivish and Chasidish, there are many &#8220;closet&#8221; Orthoprax by Default Jews. I don&#8217;t mean to say, they are Orthoprax on purpose. I mean that they practice Judaism purely out of habit or social pressure, or conditioning. These are the Frum people you see all the time that are simply uneducated or uninformed on the basic tenets of their beliefs. Sure, they may have memorized the 13 Ikkarim, or other formulae for their beliefs, but their actions speak way louder than their thoughts. They can&#8217;t articulate why they do what they do. For many people, the issues of hashkafa and emunah are not part of their lives. They do all the mitzvos they can, they follow halacha, but it is void of any &#8220;theology&#8221;. It is just their &#8220;lifestyle&#8221;. That is also Orthoprax. And that is something that is common, prevalent and ubiquitous throughout any sect of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>This is not ideal. But it is reality. Rabbi Pruzansky seems to assume that all Frum Jews who practice halachic Judaism are familiar with their &#8220;dox&#8221;. But they are not. And sadly, these Jews do not even want to be Orthoprax, but they are by default. Instead of worrying about the people that have defined their beliefs as separate from traditional Frum Judaism, we would be better served helping the closet Orthoprax who WANT to be Orthodox become Orthodox in the truest sense of the word.</p>
<p>Our system has become great at creating robots. I call them Orthoprax by Default. We can do better&#8230;</p>
