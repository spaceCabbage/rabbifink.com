				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left; "><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1565 alignleft" title="Venice 1910" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winwardc10a-150x150.jpg" alt="Venice 1910" width="150" height="150" />The <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> Shul on the Beach has hosted many, many guest. Jews and non-Jews from all over the world have come through its doors marveling at its charm and aura.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">This morning the Pacific Jewish Center hosted a special group of visitors. Friend of the Shul, Harry Medved is an active member of the <a href="http://www.venicehistorical.org/" target="_blank">Venice Historical Society</a>. Today, the Venice Historical Society arranged a walking tour of Venice with a focus on landmarks and locations used in movies and Television.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">The tour made a stop at the Shul on the Beach.<span id="more-1560"></span>This is our shul sporting a new, classic Venice paint job.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1561" title="Pacific Jewish Center Shul on the Beach" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_032811.jpg" alt="Pacific Jewish Center Shul on the Beach" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
<p style="text-align: left; ">
<p style="text-align: left; ">
<p style="text-align: left; ">
<p style="text-align: left; ">Once at the shul, I welcomed the group into the sanctuary where Harry told the attendees of some of the cinematographic significance of the shul.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">I added my 2 cents to the discussion. We got a notice that NCIS LA is filming in front of the shul on Tuesday and that I was able to see the front entrance canopy in the movie &#8220;I Love You, Man&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1563" title="Venice Historical Society Inside the Pacific Jewish Center" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_0334.jpg" alt="Venice Historical Society Inside the Pacific Jewish Center" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Then I addressed the crowd. I spoke briefly about the importance of the Shul on the Beach. A landmark that is passed by thousands of people every month has an impact on those who see it. Even if the only benefit the shul provided was that the passers-by reflected on their lives for a second, it would be an important place.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">But there is so much more than just the brick and mortar of the shul. There is a vibrant community, weekly services, acts of loving-kindness, Torah classes and much more in our shul. I thanked everyone for visiting and invited them back to see us again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">We wrapped up this part of the tour with a group photograph in front of the shul. It came out really nice. (Thanks to my wife Tova for snapping the picture and thanks Leslie Friedman for giving me a hand welcoming the Venice Historical Society.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1564" title="IMG_0336" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_0336.jpg" alt="IMG_0336" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Harry Medved is in the center wearing a blue shirt. See if you can spot the Rabbi&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">It&#8217;s like that awesome game &#8220;Where&#8217;s Waldo&#8221;!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding the perfect blog URL is an adventure. The choices are endless and one&#8217;s mood can affect one&#8217;s opinion tremendously, leading to potential buyer&#8217;s remorse.</p>
<p>As I talked on the phone with my blog consultant, Judd Magilnick, we searched for the perfect concept. Our ideas ranged from the ultra bland, finkblog.com to the ultra creative ifinkican.com. We were having a hard time agreeing and my family was nixing just about every suggestion.<span id="more-927"></span></p>
<p>Eventually, finkorswim.com was suggested. Of course, there were some detractors at first, but as we realized the deeper connotations of finkorswim.com its appropriateness became apparent.</p>
<p>A play on words from &#8220;Sink or Swim&#8221;, finkorswim.com reminds us that if we don&#8217;t swim, we will sink. In fact the Talmud teaches us that a father is obligated to teach his child to swim. This is a lesson in parenting. A father must provide his child with the tools necessary to navigate through life. Further, a teacher is compared to a father in Judaism and students are compared to children.</p>
<p>A Rabbi is a teacher. It is my job, as the Rabbi of the Pacific Jewish Center in Venice, to help provide the tools necessary to &#8220;swim&#8221; in the sea of life. When I speak at Pacific Jewish Center or when I teach a class at PJC I try to provide some of those tools that we can learn from Torah to help our lives. Many of those classes are available here on the blog.</p>
<p>Another way I try to do my job of helping folks swim through the sea of life is by providing perspective on social issues, news items, ethical dilemmas and anything else that floats through my mind. Reading my thoughts on various subjects and reading the thoughts of other readers can also provide tools for swimming through life. Many of those thoughts and ramblings can also be found on this blog.</p>
<p>Another idea that finkorswim.com represents is a direct invitation to all. When you got to the beach you have a choice. You can go a swim or surf, or sunbathe or walk the boardwalk. But other times, you can also &#8220;fink&#8221; and come into the magical walls of the Pacific Jewish Center and study the ancient wisdom of the Torah. One can learn, socialize and grow tremendously as a person in our quaint Shul. There is a special feeling inside the Shul that I know you will feel once you come inside.</p>
<p>So, next time you are on Venice Beach, don&#8217;t forget, you can &#8220;fink&#8221; or &#8216;&#8221;swim&#8221;, or you can do both!</p>
