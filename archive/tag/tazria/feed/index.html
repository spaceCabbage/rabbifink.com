				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6936" alt="baby" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-300x294.png" width="300" height="294" />The beginning of Parshas Tazria instructs the Jewish people on commandments that relate to matters of childbirth. One law sates that a woman who gives birth is ritually impure for seven days if she bears a son and fourteen days if she bears a daughter.</p>
<p>The Torah does not tell us why there is a difference between the days of ritual impurity for a son and a daughter. Naturally, this led our great rabbis to speculate and provide their own insights into these laws. Inevitably these commentaries will reflect the social and scientific norms of their milieu.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to track the development of these ideas.</p>
<p>Two general categories of interpretations are given to explain the discrepancy between the days of impurity for a son and a daughter. One category goes the social route and the other goes the medical route.<span id="more-6935"></span></p>
<p>The social route generally considers sons to be a great blessing and daughters to be a bit of a curse. Rabbi Josh Waxman has a great example of one medieval commentator who takes this tack (see: <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com/2013/04/guys-rule-in-tazria.html">Guys rule in Tazria</a>). One can see hints of this sort of thinking in the Talmud as well. Boys earned money for the family while girls were a financial strain on the ancient family. Thus, it follows that there would be a longer period of ritual impurity for a daughter because it was less joyous. I&#8217;m not sure how this actually works logically, but you do see this line of thinking.</p>
<p>The medical route considers the birth of a son to be easier or to expel less blood or that girls are born &#8220;cooler&#8221; so the mother needs longer to heal because coolness causes illness or that boys are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 40 days and girls are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 80 days. These are ideas found in the Rishonim to explain the double waiting time for a daughter.</p>
<p>None of these reasons would satisfy the modern reader of the Chumash. No matter how &#8220;frum&#8221; one may be, these explanations don&#8217;t work anymore. Either because girls no longer cost more than boys, or because daughters are not considered a curse. Further, we know that the medicine found in these interpretations is incorrect as well.</p>
<p>Artscroll, which is by and large very traditionalist in their interpretations, shies away from these ancient commentaries as well. They are almost forced to pluck a beautiful idea from a very unlikely source to give some sort of explanation here. Artscroll quotes R&#8217; Dovid Tzvi Hoffman (late 19th century) who says that really the appropriate amount of days would be fourteen days. But since we want the mother of the child to attend the Bris Milah the Torah subtracts some time from the ritual impurity and knocks it down to seven days so that she will be able to participate in her son&#8217;s entering of the covenant.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Hoffman&#8217;s answer is lovely. But it is not found in earlier commentaries. The reason for that is because up until recently, the other interpretations were plausible. Once those interpretations became anachronistic, another interpretation was needed. R&#8217; Hoffman provides one such interpretation. Artscroll is written for 21st century Jews. They wisely choose the newer, more modern interpretation for their publication.</p>
<p>The beginning of the parsha also features some ancient science on conception. The verse says that a &#8220;woman who seeds a seed a births a son.&#8221; The implication is that the son is born because because the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221;. The Talmud explains that when the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a son. When the man &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a daughter. Ramban explains that the woman&#8217;s blood meets the man&#8217;s semen and they are the two ingredients that form the child. Whichever is &#8220;first&#8221; determines the gender. With this (wrong) medical explanation, the verse makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Ramban also brings the Greek version of conception which is different and has nothing to do with who is first. So he then explains how the verse is rendered if one holds like the Greeks! Ramban says that the word simply means seed in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>What are we to make of all this?</p>
<p>First of all, we see several examples of interpretations from ancient times that no longer work today. We are forced to abandon these commentaries and seek out newer commentaries. More importantly, it means that the ancient commentaries were based on conventional wisdom of their times. They did the best they could with what they had available to them. But their commentaries were not infallible. Particularly in areas of matters that are flux we cannot avoid the conclusion that they made mistakes and that their science or social conventions were not Divine.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think we see that even Ramban himself wasn&#8217;t so sure that Chazal were right about conception. He quotes the Greeks and gives a less elegant interpretation of the verse to reconcile their view. What does this mean? It means that when science buttresses up against the words of a verse, we are forced to reconcile the verse using creative interpretations. That must be allowed. After all the Ramban did just that. Today we are faced with similar challenges. Sometimes the old, simpler interpretations no longer work. What would Ramban do? He would reinterpret. But who among us has the shoulders of Ramban? Anyone? No one?</p>
<p>It is possible that the next Ramban is in our midst today. But with our somewhat stifling manner of Chumash study which hardly allows for innovation and reinterpretation, how will our Ramban ever show himself? Or perhaps she is a she? Who knows? One thing is clear, we don&#8217;t learn or teach Chumash the same way our ancestors learned Chumash. Instead we teach ChumashÂ <em>the way our ancestors taught it.</em> I think we can do better.</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Tazria-Metzora<br />
Toras HaYoledes</h2>
<p>The study of <em>smichas haparshiyos</em> always reveals fascinating insights into the inner meanings of Torah. Text and context are so vital in shaping the values and mores that are to shape our outlook as well. One significant message is presented by Chazal as we traverse the <em>yesodos</em> of <em>parshas</em> Shimini, read last week, and begin the study of <em>parshas</em> Metzorah this Shabbos. It is a bridge which reminds us of the proper context of our <em>avodas </em>Hashem still today.</p>
<p>Chazal note that <em>parshas</em> Shmini concludes by summing up the laws of <em>kashrus</em> using the phrase, â<em>zos Toras habihama.â </em>Our <em>parsha</em> begins with the renewal of human existence and the birth of children entering the world and the words â<em>zos Toras hayoledes.â</em> The commentaries wonder why the <em>Toras habihama</em> precedes the <em>Toras haadam</em>. Surely, it is people who are the focus of creation. Shouldnât we study the creation of man and then follow it with the <em>Toras habihama?</em> What is to be understood from the sequence of these <em>psukim</em>?<span id="more-5455"></span></p>
<p>To answer this question, the Midrash introduces the <em>parsha</em> with the <em>posuk</em> from Tehillim (139:4) <em>Achor vakedem tzartani</em> <em>â â</em>backwards and forwards You shaped me<em>.â </em>Says Râ Yishmael bar Tanchum <em>âAchor lâchal hamaasim vâkodem lâchol haâonshim&#8230;â </em>you are last with regards to your actions (you are the pinnacle of creation), yet you are the first for all of consequences (if you abuse life)<em>.âÂ  </em>The Midrash continuesâif you are worthy then all of creation was prepared for you. However if <em>râl</em> one is unworthy then even the gnat has preceded you in<em> maâaseh breishis. </em></p>
<p>The message of this lesson is powerful. Of all the creatures of the world, only human kind needs guidance and training to be successful. Beavers need not attend engineering school. Fish do not take swimming lessons and bees are exempt from food chemistry courses. It is only people that need education and coaching to master their destiny and fulfill their role in this world. Our performance is in our own hands. Chazal are reminding us that the sequence of <em>Toras habihama</em> preceding <em>Toras haadam</em> is to deliver context and meaning to our spiritual destiny. If we learn, study and continually grow, then the <em>Toras habihama</em> and indeed, the entire world is the gift which greets us to enjoy a beautiful world filled with all of His bounty. By providing us a world ready with all that we need, Hakadosh Baruch Hu has given each of us all of the tools we could possibly desire to achieve our spiritual destiny. We can rise to the apex of piety and the spiritual nirvana toward which we aspire to soar.Â  But, if the gift of life and the opportunity to do <em>mitzvos</em> are not taken advantage of, and His bountiful blessings are wasted through our apathy, indifference and self-centered laziness, resulting in sin, then we are truly no different than the insignificant gnat created early on in the six days of creation. In fact we are worse. They, after all, are fulfilling their prescribed role but we, who have free choice, are not doing ours. What a waste.</p>
<p>As we progress through the âcount-upâ to Shavuos, this lesson is a vital reminder of our personal and national mission as an <em>ohr lâamim</em>. We can only illuminate the world if we are willing to use His gifts to bring <em>kavod</em> and glory to His name through our actions. That is the true purpose of life, to take the <em>Toras habihama</em> and all of the <em>olam hagashmi</em> it symbolizes and sanctify it through the spiritual potential of <em>Toras haadam</em>.</p>

<h2>Parshas Tazria<br />
Be a Man!</h2>
<p>Plague and penance are twin themes which emanate from the laws of tzaraas that fill our parsha. The personal impact of schar vâonesh is directed to one and all by the forceful words of the parsha. There are, however, other important issues raised by Chazal which teach us valuable lessons for eternity.</p>
<p>In describing the onset of the dreadful malady of tzaraas, the posuk states adam ki yhyeh bâor bsaro seis oh sapachas oh bahares vihasya bâor bsaro lânegah tzaraas. Chazal wonder, why is the term adam used as the appellation to describe an individual so horribly afflicted? Indeed, the Zohar states that adam (atem kruyim adam) is the highest madreiga of the four expressions used by the Torah to describe people (adam, gever, enosh and ish). Would not a person who has succumbed to the lowly level of cheit and/or defilement of character, which resulted in his becoming a metzorah, be more worthy of a title less significant than that of the lofty adam? How are we to reconcile the horrific reality of sin and the nobility of adam which the posuk has now bound together for eternity?<span id="more-4040"></span></p>
<p>One approach takes us more profoundly into the depths of this verse and leaves us with a phenomenal practical message. The Medrash Rabba and Tanchuma teach that the four stages of negaim described in the opening posuk of parshas negaim, sâeis, sapachas, bahares and lânegah tzaraas correspond to the four galuyos. Sâeis is Bavel, sapachas equals the exile of Paras and Madai, bahares represents the domination of Yavon and negah tzaraas parallels the current long, dark, golus of Edom. What is their connection to tzaraas? And what are Chazal trying to teach us with this drasha?</p>
<p>Perhaps the pshat is an important lesson about ourselves and the attitude we must take in the quest for self improvement. In a perfect world we are the regal, noble and holy adam that Hashem Yisborach intended. Zos Toras haadam aptly describes the apex of our reach! We have a Torah all our own and a spiritual power and potential unmatched in maaseh breishis. We are the pinnacle of creation. We are His children.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when the cold winds of golus cast their chill upon us we do not merely suffer the physical depravation of exile, we find our ruchniyos wanting. Engulfed in the grip of the nations who surround us with their culture and values, we find that we slip and sadly, do not always hold our own over the forces of tumah which attempt to subvert us. We err in our spiritual judgments, our daily priorities and even how we treat each other. The result is Tzaaras. Not a very adam like behavior. Yet despite our fall, Hashem Yisborach wants to inspire us to do teshuva, to reach beyond the moment and strive higher. As such, He teaches us, My children, the sâeis, sapachas, bahares and negah tzaraas, are not the real you. You are an adam! You can transcend the golus and persevere, indeed you must. You can arm yourself to overcome the lonely, scorned life of the metzorah if you but focus your energy on being the adam that defines your opportunity for Kedusha in this world. As an adam you have so much potential. Do not despair of your plight. If you firmly set your sights on returning to your status and stature of adam you can shake off the blight of golus which has infected you. You can ward off the challenges to your emunah and avodas Hashem which befall you.</p>
<p>It is no different today, not when we err or when our children or our students make mistakes. The parsha reminds us that Hashem Yisborach sets forth a paradigm for the corrective process sometimes needed in chinuch (our own and others). He cries out to each of us, âMy children, do not despair. Arise. Do not let the forces that surround you corrupt your beautiful neshama. Be the adam I know you can be.â Indeed, when positive energy is applied to the tikun of our flaws, there is no obstacle we cannot overcome.</p>
