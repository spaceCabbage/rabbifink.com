				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6981" alt="stop-terrorism" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stop-terrorism-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" />Americans are still reeling from a terror attack in Boston last week. The bombers have been identified through fairly conclusive evidence and one is in custody while the other is dead. They were immigrants from war torn Chechnya and they practiced Islam.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the word. Whenever we hear about a violent crime, or regional violence and we hear the word Islam, there is a tendency to presume that the violence is <em>because </em>of Islam. Part of this is because many violent Muslims claim to be acting for the sake of Allah or Jihad. Also, there are a large number of verses in the Quran and Hadith that seem to promote violence and so outsiders can connect the dots and attribute the violence to religion.</p>
<p>Our minds yearn for simple answers to explain complicated things. We want one answer for everything. Our brains are wired with this built-in laziness. It is the same laziness that creates and perpetuates stereotypes through selection bias. It&#8217;s just easier for our brains to make everything simple, and so we try. I submit that my blog post is <em>also</em> an oversimplification. But it is an alternative explanation that does away with bigotry and racism. For that reason alone I think it is worth considering.</p>
<p>For the sake of this post we are going to assume that there is more violence in Arab Muslim countries and that Arab Muslims commit more acts of terror than other groups. <strong>NOTE: I believe these assumptions can be rebutted. However my point will stand even if these assumptions are conceded. Maybe another time we will discuss these presumptions.</strong></p>
<p><em>If you are going to comment on this post here or on Facebook, or wherever, I ask that you please address the arguments and stick to facts instead of just calling people names. Thank you.</p>
<p><span id="more-6980"></span></p>
<p></em></p>
<p>In the USA there are about 40 murders every day. Over 14,000 people are senselessly killed in our country every year. The top countries on a list of the rate of intentional deaths around the world is dominated by non-Arab Muslim countries. Death is everywhere. Violence is everywhere. It&#8217;s not an Arab Muslim phenomena.</p>
<p>Why do people kill? What are the factors that create the social circumstances ripe for murder and death?</p>
<p>I think the first thing we need to do is distinguish between isolated murders and systematic killing. [By systematic killing we don't mean genocide. That is a government systematically killing people. We are talking about subcultures where killing is part of normal life.] In the USA many homicides are part of systematic killing cycles. Gang wars, drug cartel and mafia killings are a very large percentage of USA homicides. These are not isolated killings, they are part of a culture of killing and death. We are going to ignore isolated murders because terrorism fits more neatly into the latter category.</p>
<p>In the parts of the USA that we find systematic killing, specifically street gangs and to a lesser extent organized crime I think you&#8217;ll find that their social environments provide very few escape hatches. One is born into a neighborhood or a family and that becomes that person&#8217;s identity. It is very hard to break free from the default positions we are born into. Even more so for those with few economic prospects on the outside. Inevitably, education is shunned and it becomes even more difficult to leave.</p>
<p>People living in those conditions don&#8217;t have as much to live for as the rest of us. We view the world through a lens of opportunity, they view it through a lens of oppression. Their violent way of life is not excusable. It is destructive and they are culpable for their bad choices, but we can understand that their struggle is quite different than the white middle class American&#8217;s struggle.</p>
<p>These are the conditions that are ripe for violence: Little hope of improving one&#8217;s situation, a culture where violence is mistaken for bravery, where education is not valued and hard to come by, and primitive views of &#8220;might is right&#8221; prevail. This is what our gang culture looks like in the USA.</p>
<p>It also happens to be what the world of many Arab Muslims in developing countries looks like.</p>
<p>Another example. In apartheid South Africa, there was a lot of black on white violence. I am not excusing the violence. However, it is obvious to us in hindsight that an oppressed group of people with the same conditions that are present in gang culture would resort to violence. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain. These are the conditions ripe for death and violence.</p>
<p>A third example. Before terrorism we had the Cold War. The enemy was Communism and its violent fanatics. I think we can draw similar parallels to Communist violence as well. People had nothing to lose and everything to gain by being violent. It takes a long time to change that mindset. As it stands today, Russia still has a high homicide rate (more than double the rate in the USA). The conditions have not changed enough in the last few decades to give people the hope and opportunity to succeed. Violence is still rampant.</p>
<p>While it is true that all Arab Muslim terrorists read the Quran and may even claim to be acting for the sake of Allah, those are not necessarily the reasons the terrorists among them act violently. It is more reasonable to assume that they systematically kill for the same reason that other people kill. It is a much more elegant explanation.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that once a person is set upon a path of violence they will use whatever justification that they can find. Arab Muslims will use the Quran, gang members will use the &#8220;Code&#8221;, blacks suffering from apartheid will use the struggle for freedom, Cold War Communists will use the &#8220;Mother Country&#8221; as their justifications. The ideologies may or may not be corrupt or wrong, but to people seeking an escape they provide the after-the-fact justification. In other words, even if the Quran was as genteel as Confucius, people living under these conditions would likely turn to violence anyway.</p>
<p>At this point, we don&#8217;t know the motivations of Boston Bombers. However, just because they are Muslim and killers does not mean that they killed because of their Muslim faith. There are many other reasons that people kill and there is a strong correlation between all systematic killings that spans the racial and religious gamut. I know that Glenn Beck could probably explain how Communism and Gangs and apartheid Blacks are all really using the same ideology as Islam, but we are trying to have a mature conversation about this issue.</p>
<p>Further, even if they claim that they acted on behalf of their religious beliefs, this is not an indictment of Islam. Anything can be used as justification for death. It is only an indictment of their flawed justification. And if we are looking for an explanation, stopping with &#8220;The Quran&#8221; is lazy, and in all likelihood very, very wrong.</p>
<p>The next level of this discussion is that it is wrong to profile all Arab Muslims the same way it would be wrong to profile all poor people with inferior education. Yes, many terrorists are Arab Muslims but by focusing on that one point and ignoring the rest of their social conditions is too lazy and too unfair. If we eliminated Islam from the world people would just use a different justification for their violence. Murder does not require religion or ideology. But systematic killing can usually be traced to a combination of factors that transcend religion.</p>
<p>Our collective energies are more wisely targeted if we can help remove the barriers to education and financial success in the communities where violence is so prevalent. Whether it&#8217;s on the South Side of Chicago, Watts in Los Angeles, East Baltimore, Cairo, or some remote village in Chechnya we can do more to eliminate the social ills that make violence and terrorism possible. We need to give them the tools they need to succeed. Most of all we need to give them hope.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/london-riots-fire.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4527" title="london-riots-fire" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/london-riots-fire-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215" /></a>Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks published a lovely op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. The article attempts to explain the underlying reasons for the horrible riots in London. As always, Rabbi Sacks is articulate, passionate and well-reasoned.</p>
<p>However, in this case I think the good rabbi is mistaken. At leasts to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sacks makes the claim that the depreciating value system in the UK is the source of the problem that gave rise to the riots. In particular, the eroding of Judeo-Christian values in Britain has created an environment which spawns a litany of social problems.</p>
<p>I agree that the social problems are one of the things that can cause riots. They are not the only consideration.<span id="more-4526"></span> Economic woes are also a huge factor. When people are bored, have no job to look forward to, they are more likely  to engage in anti-social behavior. Sure, one can also try to wedge the unemployment issues around the world into a failed allegiance to Judeo-Christian values. I know I have heard similar assertions. But I believe that is a bit far-fetched. Religious societies, have recessions. Even (believe it or not) the &#8220;free market&#8221; also allows for recessions in the economy. Permanent growth is impossible.</p>
<p>The problem I have with the article is that it ignores all the mobs and riots throughout history that certainly were rooted in Judeo-Christian values. Or the mobs and riots in predominantly religious neighborhoods. Or the thousands of years of killing in the name of religion.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that this riot should have a different cause than all the riots before the decay of the Judeo-Christian values in Britain.</p>
<p>Further, there are many wonderful societies not based on Jude0-Christian values where, I know this is going to sound shocking, there are not violent riots.</p>
<p>I believe that there are equally compelling arguments for good social behavior from a non-religious perspective. One problem, in my opinion, is that the religious people view the non-religious as heathens and the &#8220;enemy&#8221;. This creates a hostile social environment. There are universal values that we agree upon. The issues upon which we disagree should not create the discord and anger that they do.</p>
<p>Religious and non-religous people all agree that riots are bad. Honesty and peace are universal good values. There is no reason to make this a religious issue.</p>
<p>Perhaps most bothersome to me about the article is that similar hooligans in the USA who are gang members certainly express themselves as religious. They wear crosses, they get crosses and other religious symbols tattooed into their skin, many attend church as well. It is simply unfair to paint rioters with an anti-Judeo-Christian brush.</p>
<p>In short: Rabbi Sacks assumes 3 things that I think are faulty assumptions. First, the reason for the riots is the decay of Judeo-Christian values. Second, that Judeo-Christian values &#8220;prevent&#8221; rioting. Finally, that rioters do not identify with Judeo-Christian values.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I loved the article.</p>

<p>Without getting to far afield in the nitty gritty of the local politics, there is an election for a seat in Congress representing the 36th Congressional District on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Democratic candidate is Janice Hahn. She appeared to be a shoo-in for the seat in a fairly moderate to liberal district. One particular issue has turned the tides of the race and created a virtual heat heading into the final weekend.</p>
<p>The issue (this is as &#8220;neutral point of view&#8221; I can put it) is Hahn&#8217;s policies with regard to gang members. In particular she facilitated the placement of criminals as gang interventionists and had them paid via a third party.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to see how this is being portrayed negatively. Or more to the point, why this is being portrayed negatively. <span id="more-4404"></span>The biggest crime issue in Los Angeles is gangs. One of the more effective ways of curbing gang violence is negotiating peace treaties. I met the fellow who negotiated the truce between the Bloods and Crips. It took almost 10 years to form an agreement. (His name is Aquila Sherrils.) Hahn enlisted the help of some senior gang members to negotiate for peace between gangs. These representatives were paid by football legend Jim Brown&#8217;s foundation. She also strongly supported programs to help gang members receive recognition for changing their lives. All of this seems very good.</p>
<p>Yet, Fox LA ran a nearly 10 minute segment on Janice Hahn&#8217;s &#8220;horrifying&#8221; involvement with gang members. The bias and slant in this report is embarrassing (for them) and an indictment on the public. If the public does not want to see programs and initiative such as Ms. Hahn&#8217;s what do they want? If working from within gangs to promote peace treaties is a bad idea, what is a good idea? If it is seen as a blemish on ones record for thinking creatively and bravely about how to solve the gang problems what would a sparkling record look like?</p>
<p>This report has me so upset at Fox, the public and the organizers of Hahn&#8217;s opponent&#8217;s campaign who are text messaging the entire district about this horrible report. Note, the report makes no accusations of wrongdoing or impropriety. It is simply the concept that Hahn is helping gang members that is so obscene that it renders her am unqualified conduct. As one website promoting Hahn&#8217;s indiscretions put it: Hahn is directing public funds to &#8220;support violent, inner-city criminals&#8221;.<br />
Disgraceful.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think.</p>
<p>(Sorry, whoever uploaded this video squished everybody&#8230;)</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I do not endorse or support any candidate in this race. This blog post is for information purposes only. I am not saying I agree with Hahn on this issue. I am saying that the way she is being portrayed as a villain for doing good work is very disturbing to me.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team-photo-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3776" title="team-photo-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team-photo-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Compton is one of the toughest neighborhoods in Los Angeles. It has been ranked as the 17th most dangerous city in America. Gangs are a part of daily life in Compton. The streets are run by ex-cons, cons and future cons. Drugs and death pervade the very air.</p>
<p>Gang life is usually not a choice for folks growing up in these neighborhoods. It&#8217;s like being born into a family. You&#8217;re in because you&#8217;re born in. It is extremely difficult to break free from the gangs. But it can be done.</p>
<p>I think it is obvious that providing non-violent outlets for youth is an important tool for helping youths avoid the gang lifestyle. <span id="more-3775"></span>The problem is that most &#8220;outlets&#8221; don&#8217;t create the family feel, structure and sense of belonging that a gang provides. The exception to that is sports. Being on a team, especially a good team feeds the same hunger that a gang feeds. Unfortunately, sports teams are also run over with gangs. The teams represent the gangs. The winners assert dominance over the losing gang.</p>
<p>On a deeper level there is another flaw with most sports as an alternative to gang life. Sports don&#8217;t really demand etiquette and respect. Trash talking is part of the game. Then there is the violence. Basketball, soccer and football, the most popular &#8220;pick up&#8221; sports in SoCal are rough and tough games. There is jostling, tackling, fouls and much contact between players. One could say that sports feed into the violent gang culture to a degree.</p>
<p>That is why this BBC report on a Cricket team from Compton is extra remarkable. Cricket has pageantry, etiquette and respect. It is the ultimate gentleman&#8217;s game. Somehow, the sport has caught on in Compton. The team has toured across the world drawing rave reviews from more experienced cricket teams in real cricket countries.</p>
<p>The team has been somewhat successful in getting kids off the streets but they have higher goals. They want to build a cricket field in Compton. I wish them the best of luck.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>
