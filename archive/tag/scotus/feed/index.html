				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that it is unconstitutional for a state to ban same sex marriage. The issue still divides America, though the latest Pew numbers say 54% of Americans are in favor of gay marriage and only 36% oppose.</p>
<p>In the Orthodox Jewish community, the matter is far less polarizing. I could not find any actual numbers, but I think most people are correct in assuming that the vast majority of Orthodox Jews oppose same sex marriage for themselves and for America. All the mainstream Orthodox Jewish umbrella organizations have issued statements over the past few years reiterating this opposition. Some Orthodox Jews are ambivalent on the issue, and a small minority are in favor of gay marriage.</p>
<p>I celebrate the Supreme Court decision.<span id="more-9339"></span></p>
<p>A lot of people are confused how an Orthodox rabbi who follows the Torah and its laws could celebrate the legalization of gay marriage.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/28/i-believe-in-torah-halacha-and-equality/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1-si/" rel="attachment wp-att-9340"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9340" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si_.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I have been mocked, berated, insulted, defrocked, and even ousted from Orthodoxy for supporting marriage equality. I’ve been asked, respectfully and less respectfully, how I reconcile my  belief in marriage equality and my religious beliefs. This is my official response.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a civil rights issue. Gay people exist. They are your neighbors and co-workers. They might be your friends and family as well. It’s hard to be gay in America. There’s trauma involved. Gay people fall in love. They want to live together as a married couple. They want to get married for the same reasons everyone else wants to get married. Restricting consenting adults from a loving, committed marriage is a form of discrimination. I believe that discrimination is wrong. I believe that citizens of free countries should not feel oppressed. I believe that more freedom for more people is a good thing for everyone, including Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>Of course, I am concerned about the implications of the ruling. I am concerned about clergy with religious objections to officiating a gay marriage, but those personal concerns cannot trump the more basic civil rights of others, especially people who typically suffer persecution and discrimination.</p>
<p>I am not concerned about slippery slopes or men marrying dogs and bikes and children. Marriage requires consent. Dogs, bikes, and children cannot consent.</p>
<p>I am not concerned that America is becoming a Godless state with no morals. If you want equal rights and protection under the law, everyone else must benefit, too. It is wrong to suggest that equality applies unevenly. Orwell said it best in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451526341/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0451526341&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=VHSNVVTJV2A2QCBZ">Animal Farm</a>, <em>&#8220;All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&#8221;</em> It is moral to be fair to others, even if those others are people who violate your religious beliefs. There are competing morals in this case, and America is choosing the more compassionate and the more just of the moral options.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a good thing. I celebrate marriage equality. I am also an Orthodox Jew and I would not perform a religious wedding ceremony that is not consistent with my understanding of Jewish law, including a gay marriage. Those two statements are not contradictory.</p>
<p>There is a long list of things that I think are very important to Orthodox Judaism. Banning gay marriage is near the bottom of the list. Kindness, compassion, and fairness are near the top of the list.</p>
<p>I understand that many Orthodox Jews have visceral fears about this gay marriage because of Jewish law. I hope we can get past those fears and move forward toward understanding and love.</p>

<p>Nothing like a Supreme Court of the United States nomination to get me to blog again.</p>
<p>Elena Kagan has been nominated for the SCOTUS. I have no opinion about her. I do have an opinion about some of the people opposing her&#8230;</p>
<p>I have been planning a brief series on anti-semitism. This post will be the first of a few that deal with various specifics and nuances of anti-semitism in my opinion.</p>
<p>Have you seen the <a href="http://innate-differences.blogspot.com/2010/05/one-picture-worth-1000-kikes.html" target="_blank">cries of anti-semitism</a> connected with Kagan? They come from Orthodox Jews who have trouble dealing with their own insecurities. Why?<span id="more-2452"></span></p>
<p>Most RW Jews are very conservative politically. Kagan is not. Her existence and certainly her appointment the SCOTUS is not viewed favorably in their eyes. Subconsciously, they need a way to protest her appointment and the first thing that pops into their minds is the old &#8220;anti-semitism card&#8221;.</p>
<p>People point to the caricature of her as anti-semitic. People think that it is reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Nazi propaganda was general. It showed Jews as having certain features and overemphasized those features in order to make a separate point. &#8220;Jews steal&#8221;, &#8220;Jews are like vermin&#8221;, &#8220;Jews run the world&#8221;, etc. The caricature was to paint a villain with gross features and then label the villain with gross acts. It works better than painting the villain with gross acts with a face like Clooney or Pitt&#8230;</p>
<p>The cartoon of Kagan is just a cartoon. It exaggerates her features because those are HER features. It&#8217;s the same way a Leno cartoon has a huge chin and Bush cartoon has a squat head and long ears. It pokes fun at their appearance but is in no way anti-long chin or anti-squat head with long ears. Accentuating Kagan&#8217;s features in a cartoon can&#8217;t be off limits because she happens to be Jewish.</p>
<p>A second thing about all this anti-semitism talk is very ironic. I have not seen any reports from mainstream media that even mentions that Kagan is Jewish. It is not an issue for most people. Why do we think that it is an issue? It&#8217;s like we invent an issue to get upset about. Kagan was chosen because of her credentials and the diversity she brings to the court. Doesn&#8217;t that champion minorities like Jews? How is that anti-semitic!?</p>
<p>The last thing I want to address is the complaint lodged by a commenter on DovBear&#8217;s post. Mamzer Talmid Chacham said &#8220;I&#8217;d still like it better if he nominated someone who was actually a judge&#8221;. It so happens that one of the greatest SCOTUS justices of all time, Justice Warren, was not a judge. One large criticism of the SCOTUS is the seemingly similar paths all the justices took to get to the court. Choosing Kagan adds another element of much needed diversity to the court.</p>
