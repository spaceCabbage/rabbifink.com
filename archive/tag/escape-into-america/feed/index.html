It was Purim and they wanted to take pictures, talk with me and some of our Shul members and join in our Purim Celebration.</p>
<p>Never ones to turn down inviting strangers into the Shul, we welcomed them.</p>
<p>As I wrote at the time, our Purim Celebration was really special as we welcomed anyone and everyone off the boardwalk into our Shul.

<p>Nancy took beautiful candid photos and David kind of blended in with the rest of us<span id="more-2382"></span> talking to us and learning about the Pacific Jewish Center and the festival of Purim.</p>
<p>Purim is a funny time to be introduced to new people. Things are a little different on Purim. But David managed to get to know us in a way that I never thought an outsider could.</p>
<p>Nancy and David produced a wonderful photo-film of their visit. It is part of their Escape Into America Series. The series is incredible. They have managed to find a lot of soul throughout their travels and it really comes through in their work.</p>
<p>In the photo-film about us, they did a really super job cutting through it all and finding the soul of our shul.</p>
<p>There are a couple things in the photo-film that are not perfectly precise, but that&#8217;s okay. (2 minor corrections: 1- I did mention to David that Purim costumes were likely borrowed for the Venice Carnival in the 15th Century and yet costumes fit in well with the themes of the day, 2- I am not sure I actually said that the Shul was in danger of disappearing &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t, rather, it could have been on that path).</p>
<p>Other than a couple minor mistakes the photo-film really captures the essence of Purim in our Shul as well as much of the essence of who we are at Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>The video stars everyone, but Yosef Beithalachmi (aka Mr. Pickles) and Ashi Bersin are featured in the voice-over. Great job!</p>
