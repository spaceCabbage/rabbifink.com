				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x5951.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5392" title="article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x595" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x5951-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>It was last Pesach that the NY Times slipped an <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/" target="_blank">article about Kiryas Joel</a> under the blogosphere&#8217;s radar. This year, the Post slipped an article almost under that same radar about a reality show featuring ex-hasids. But just because many of the blogs hibernate during Pesach, doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t talk about the show now.</p>
<p>Details are scant, but it seems that several of our more well-known ex-hasids will be starring in a reality show. We met Pearlperry Reich and Shauli Gros on the Dr. Phil show (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/03/05/rabbi-shmuley-is-more-embarrassing-than-pearlperry-reich-on-the-dr-phil-show-and-analysis/">Pearlperry Reich on the Dr. Phil Show</a>). Since then, we have become friends on Facebook. Now they are joining forces with Luzer Twersky to tell the world about how they left their homes and their previous lives.</p>
<p>The story is familiar enough. An insular, old-fashioned world meets the fast-paced, liberal world. The results are bound to be emotional, funny, and dramatic. The show has not yet been picked up, so there&#8217;s a chance it never airs. If it does air, the stars hope it will improve the lives of the members of the communities they left. By giving a strong voice to the ex-hasid, the show might expose some of the less savory aspects of insular life. If the claims are false, the show will be a terrible pock on the Jewish community. If the claims are true, then either we should take pride in those claims or if they are negative, try to fix them.</p>
<p>But in the end, this show is a terrible idea.<span id="more-5390"></span> I can only assume that the stars of this show have never seen reality TV shows. These shows are train wreck television. The entire point of these shows is to portray uncomfortable situations and manufacture drama. No one comes out of a reality show smelling like roses. No one. Ever.</p>
<p>Put it this way &#8211; words that have never been stated after watching a reality show: &#8220;Wow, those people seem like such lovely human beings. I hope they have much success in their lives and hopefully I can be as well-adjusted as them one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, as much as I am interested in the story that these people have to tell and as much as I empathize with many of their struggles, I can only see how this show will only harm them and their new ex-hasid community. There are other, better ways of pushing their agendas forward. If you have a message and an idea, the worst way that I can think of to spread that idea is on a reality show. How about a documentary? Or a well-written informative website? Or a speaking tour? Or writing a book? Reality TV is lazy. It is lazy for its producers. It is lazy for its viewers. But most of all, in this case, it is lazy for its stars.</p>
<p>If you have a true message and a great story, don&#8217;t sully it on reality TV. Please.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3872" title="1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="210" /></a>The Food Network has this show called &#8220;Worst Cooks in America&#8221;. I have heard of it but have never seen it. It doesn&#8217;t sound very good. But apparently it&#8217;s pretty popular. I would imagine for all the train-wreck TV fans out there, this is the perfect show.</p>
<p>The show finds horrible home cooks, teaches them culinary skills and pits them against each other in cooking competitions. One of the contestants was introduced to the viewers via his burnt cholent. Joshie Berger grew up in Boro Park and his family is Chasidic. These days Joshie is not Chasidic at all.<span id="more-3871"></span></p>
<p>The Atlantic has an article noting some of Joshie&#8217;s finer moments on the show. The article is mostly positive. But not positive in a Jewish sense. It is positive in a cultural sense. The author commends Joshie for stepping outside his comfort zone and eating shellfish. In fact Joshie is portrayed as one who is reluctant to eat non-kosher foods. The article says a &#8220;highpoint of this past season&#8221; was when Joshie overcame his aversion to treyf.</p>
<p>Some high point.</p>
<p>Joshie was a quick learner and in the end he came out on top.</p>
<p>It can be very hard for those who leave Chasidic Judaism to succeed on the outside. They have a limited education, limited social skills that are needed on the outside and they speak English as a second language. So for Joshie to emerge victorious is in fact quite impressive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also nice that, according to the article, Joshie&#8217;s old friends were rooting for him to win.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that when reading the article my stomach turned several times because of Joshie&#8217;s choices that led him away from his heritage. It&#8217;s sad.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one thing that Joshie has been preaching that is absolutely correct. Orthodox Jews need to eat better. Amen to that.</p>
