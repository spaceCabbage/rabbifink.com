				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/confidential.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3365" title="confidential" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/confidential.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="241" /></a>The Wikileaks people are at it again. Somehow they have gained access to millions of confidential files and secrets of international importance. They feel that information is power. They want the people to have that power.</p>
<p>To some, this is a noble cause. A revolution of sorts. It is the people demanding accountability from their governments and leaders. I think that is important. A Libertarian Facebook friend says that the Wikileaks folks belong in the Libertarian Hall of Fame. When the government cannot hide behind confidentiality, it diminishes their power. Libertarians are happy to see the government&#8217;s power marginalized.</p>
<p>To others, this is a disaster. Secrets are out. Feelings are hurt. Nations will be pitted against each other due to the revelations found in the Wikileaks. People may lose their jobs. A war could break out. There are a lot of reasons to oppose the Wikileaks.</p>
<p>It seems like it&#8217;s darned if you do and darned if you don&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>It got me thinking about what the Jewish approach would be to this issue.<span id="more-3364"></span> It&#8217;s actually not so simple either. But there is a formula for determining whether the Wikileaks would be a prohibited form of speech or permissible speech.</p>
<p>Jewish law highly regulates speech. One may not gossip, lie, use profanity, tell false stories about others, engage in fraudulant representation by their words among many other speech crimes. The emphasis on purity of speech is explained as a way of ensuring that the tool we use to communicate with God and the tool we use to study the words of God should be as fined tuned as possible. Using our lips for evil blunts the effect of that tool. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/06/14/manhattan-high-school-for-girls-on-pbs-dont-speak-lashon-hara/">Manhattan High School For Girls on PBS: Don&#8217;t Speak Lashon Hara</a>)</p>
<p>Another area of regulated speech is confidentiality. The Talmud says: <em>Rabbah stated that “if a man had said something to his neighbor the latter must not spread the news without the informant&#8217;s telling him ‘Go and say it.”</em></p>
<p><em></em>And thus the law is codified. Any information that is given to you, must be treated as confidential unless you have explicit permission to share the information. This is quite a departure from the contemporary worldview of information. Everything is a scoop. TMZ exists. That is enough of a proof that Jewish law is on its head in our society.</p>
<p>With all the speech regulation, one would have to assume there are exceptions. And there are. There is a caveat to almost all speech regulation in Jewish law. If there is an important reason to disclose the information, then the information may be disclosed. Further, if there are lives to be saved by disclosing the information, then one may be obligated to disclose the information. For example, one is not permitted to relate harmful information to another. However,  if the circumstances arise, one must go to the Jewish court to relate the information to the court.</p>
<p>There are millions of documents in the Wikileaks. All of the information is either explicitly confidential or implicitly confidential as there is no express consent to the sharing of the information. Using the standard of Jewish law, these documents are not permitted to be shared. Not by the &#8220;leaker&#8221; to the Wikileaks and not by the Wikileaks either.</p>
<p>But we do have exceptions. Will any of the millions of documents save lives? Perhaps. Will any of the confidential information satisfy the bar of an important reason to share confidential information? It is likely.</p>
<p>So, is there a simple answer to the question of whether the Wikileaks would be permissible to share under Jewish law. But as usual, there is a useful system for answering the question. And as always, it is better to have asked than to have not asked at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/amelias-guide-to-gossip.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2563" title="Guide to Gossip" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/amelias-guide-to-gossip-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="180" /></a>Yesterday I wrote about my high school. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/06/13/mr-miller-was-my-math-teacher-at-ner-israel/">Mr. Miller Was My Math Teacher at Ner Israel</a>) I went to a pretty well known yeshiva high school but this kind of media exposure for Ner Israel is not too common. Of course I was proud so I told my sister to check out the video and article.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, my sister told me that her high school was also famous!</p>
<p>It seems that WNET, the New York PBS affiliate, has a segment called &#8220;Religion and Ethics. A few weeks back they did a piece on hateful gossip in schools. With the advent of the internet and specifically sites like Facebook, it has become so easy to say nasty things about others and leave a permanent record of the comments.<span id="more-2562"></span></p>
<p>Cyber Abuse is what they call it. Saying things that are not nice on the internet about someone else can have a much more drastic and long term effect on the subject. Perhaps even worse than originally intended. The internet is a danger zone!</p>
<p>They talk a little bit about JuicyCampus which was one of the first and one of the most prolific sites for College students slander and gossip. It got shut down eventually and there is a new movement in its stead to try and promote good manners and ethics on the internet and limit evil speech about others.</p>
<p>The piece then moves from the extremely dangerous internet world of anonymous speech that could harm people&#8217;s lives to Manhattan High School for Girls. MHS is a Bais Yaakov style girl&#8217;s high school in Manhattan. My sisters attended MHS and I have heard really great things about the school. It might be the 2nd best girls high school in the world. Obviously the best is my father&#8217;s school, Ateres Bais Yaakov in Monsey.</p>
<p>At MHS, the girls learn about the harms of Lashon Hara (evil speech), work together to prevent and stop evil speech and care passionately about avoiding Lashon Hara. This is a stark contrast to the world of gossip that exists at high schools and Universities across the U.S.A. and has spawned shows like Gossip Girl.</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when it is permissible, in fact, even obligatory to say negative things about another person. The idea is to learn when and how to implement those exceptions. The best thing about a conscious effort to avoid speaking Lashon Hara is how it affects the way you speak by making you consider the value of your speech. Is it something that must be said? Or is it something better left unsaid?</p>
<p>The girls that are interviewed are very candid and perform very well in front of the camera. The message of the video is that we can all learn from MHS and the Jewish approach to Lashon Hara. I can only reiterate what a great message that is and congratulate MHS for truly being a light unto the nations.</p>
