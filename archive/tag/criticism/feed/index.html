				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People asked me what some of the criteria were for the rabbis who were asked to join the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/05/12/groundbreaking-meeting/">Groundbreaking Meeting</a> on Sunday. While many factors and relationships were factored, there was one overriding consideration. It was the ability to be self critical.</p>
<p>Self criticism is not easy. It&#8217;s not easy for individuals. It&#8217;s not easy for leaders or spokespeople of a movement or a group. It&#8217;s especially difficult for people who part of a group that markets itself as perfect or potentially perfect. It&#8217;s even harder when those people are actually accustomed to being advocates for the movement. Their brains are trained to minimize problems and maximize success. It can be a great challenge to switch from advocate to critic, even for a short while.<span id="more-8401"></span></p>
<p>When I talked to the participants of this meeting, I asked them if they would be comfortable with self criticism. To varying degrees, they all were. Self criticism was at the core our meeting and both groups came to the table prepared to question the established norms of Orthodox Judaism. To me, this is what made the meeting unique. Sometimes one group might go to another more powerful group with criticism, but usually the more powerful group is on the receiving end of the criticism and is serving the advocate role in defending against the criticism. Here, both groups came to the table as peers, as equals. This made all the difference in the world in our discussion.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image116.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8402" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image116.jpg?w=980" alt="image116" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It is my opinion, that the absence of self criticism is one of the most harmful aspects of any society and is particularly harmful in a religious community. So much of our focus as a community is on projecting an image of excellence and success, that we don&#8217;t engage in public self criticism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say that it&#8217;s better not to engage in self criticism in public because it gives fuel to our detractors and external critics. Some argue that self criticism can influence people to leave our community. I think this is incorrect. The thing that I have heard from people who leave or are on the fringe is that self criticism is a reason to stay, not to leave. It&#8217;s not the thing that is being criticized, as much as it is whether we are comfortable with that criticism.</p>
<p>Others have said that we need to concerned about how we appear to the outsiders. This is particularly true about when we talk about Israel. The public image of Israel is a great concern to many people. The cost of self criticism about Israel is that the image of Israel may be tainted by the criticism. To avoid contaminating Israel&#8217;s reputation some people argue that we should not make any public criticism of Israel. But to me , the greatest sign of strength is self criticism. To me, it&#8217;s far worse to be concerned with our image that with our mistakes. This is especially true in the eyes of outsiders. Isn&#8217;t it worse to be whitewashing sins than to be self critical? I think so.</p>
<p>Reputation and public opinion cannot be crafted with carefully executed marketing plans. When something has flaws, the blemishes will be noticed. It&#8217;s our choice if those flaws will be noticed despite our best efforts to hide them or if they will be noticed because of our self criticism. If we try to hide them, we face two serious risks. One is that the insiders who notice the flaw lose faith in their leadership because no one is acknowledging the problem. The second, is that outsiders will think we are disingenuously hiding concealing our problems to make ourselves artificially look better. Both of these consequences can be avoided.</p>
<p>But most of all, self criticism is the only real way to change things. We don&#8217;t like when outsiders tell us what we need to do differently. We don&#8217;t like when our way of life is scrutinized by others. But if we do the criticism for ourselves, they won&#8217;t need to disparage. More importantly, we can turn our attention to fixing problems instead of spinning our wheels to make sure no one can see our difficulties. That&#8217;s when real change can happen.</p>
<p>If I have to choose between acknowledging our problems or concealing our problems so that insiders retain their faith in our perfection or so that outsiders don&#8217;t see our imperfections and the strength of self criticism, the choice is simple. It worked magically at our meeting and I have seen its power in conversations with dozens of questioning people over the last few years. Let&#8217;s not be afraid to put our critic&#8217;s glasses on and share what we see. Let&#8217;s put ourselves under the looking glass instead of others. It&#8217;s in our best interest to identify our issues. We look better we are honest, and we have a chance at fixing things if we acknowledge our challenges.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last thing that I want to do is provide anyone with a reason to be less religiously observant. No matter where a person resides on the spectrum of belief and practice, I truly desire that their belief and practices are strengthened, not weakened.</p>
<p>You can imagine how upset it makes me when I hear that there are people who directly attribute their waning belief and observance to me. I admit that it hurts me personally. It also hurts when it’s reported to me that rabbis I respect or even know in real life, recommend that people not read the things that I write. It stings and it’s the worst part about doing what I do.<span id="more-8047"></span></p>
<p>There are literally thousands of people who read words I have written. Whether it’s on social media sites, my personal site, articles and posts I have written for other sites, or private correspondence, I have communicated with a lot of people. I recognize that it’s inevitable that some people will get the wrong idea about what I am trying to say and when that happens I understand that it could harm the reader’s observance. I also recognize that some people will correctly understand what I am saying in a particular instance and this correct understanding will still somehow undermine their version of Orthodox Judaism and cause them to be more lax in their observance.</p>
<p>The first group cannot be helped. I can’t make people better readers. I can’t force people to understand what I meant to say in the way I meant to say it. Anyone’s words can be misunderstood and used in the opposite way those words were intended. It’s happened to me in real life and it happens on the Internet too. I don’t feel so terrible about that.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Strength_0.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8048" alt="Strength_0" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Strength_0.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But the people who understand what I am saying the way I intended it and still find my intended meaning to be harmful to their observance require a response. I know that a few such people exist. I don&#8217;t think they are as vast in number as some of my critics contend, and if forced to make the choice, I truly believe, based on what I know first hand, that what I do on a broader scale likely outweighs the unfortunate negative consequences that I am addressing here.</p>
<p>My goals and agenda are not really a secret. I have written about the purpose of this blog in the past. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/06/22/what-is-the-point-of-this-blog/">What is the Point of This Blog?</a> I&#8217;ve also written about my personal vision of Orthodox Judaism. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/16/judaism-of-the-future-my-response-to-klal-perspectives-spring-2012/">Judaism of the Future</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/12/09/what-is-rationalist-judaism/">What is Rationalist Judaism?</a> among many others. My professional goal is to provide as many positive Jewish experiences to the maximum number of people possible. Creating a space for that to take place is important to me. But I still feel that it&#8217;s worthwhile for me to respond to some of the thoughtful criticism I have received in the last few months.</p>
<p>Some people think I should just say &#8220;it&#8217;s not me, it&#8217;s you&#8221; to these people.  That&#8217;s not my way. I know I can&#8217;t please everyone, but I still think that it&#8217;s important to clarify one&#8217;s position.</p>
<p>I’ll begin with a metaphor that might help clarify things. The experience of reading a Facebook status or a Tweet or even a full blog post or sometimes even an essay on the Internet, is more like eavesdropping on an ongoing conversation than tuning into a press conference. One who attends a press conference can expect that the entire matter will be covered in the conference and all necessary context will be provided so that there are no misunderstandings or mistakes. But if one is listening in on a conversatation that has been going for months, or years, or longer, the snippets that may seem to be complete thoughts are really pieces to a much larger puzzle. Those snippets lack context and can easily be manipulated in ways that contradict the speaker’s intent.</p>
<p>While it’s not a perfect metaphor, it illuminates something that could be very helpful here. If you read something that I’ve written that you feel is wrong or harmful, it would be best to contact me. Ask me for the press conference version. Because all you’ve seen was a snippet that could be misinterpreted. More importantly, if it seems I’ve undermined something, ask me how I reconcile that with my beliefs and practices. I am an Orthodox Jew. I do believe in God. I do keep Torah and Mitzvos. If something I’ve said sounds like it contradicts all that, I probably have a response to your question. Ask me. Please.</p>
<p>Often, people will hear I have said or done something that is objectively wrong or Kefira. I do err, just like anyone else makes mistakes. But I always ask for examples so that I can address the issues. Rarely, are examples provided. This makes it harder for me respond and even harder for me to reflect and adjust if necessary.</p>
<p>Fortunately, one substantive general problem has been presented to me on several occasions and being aware of the issue gives me the opportunity to respond. The claim is that sometimes I slaughter (or think I slaughter) some of the &#8220;sacred cows&#8221; of Orthodox Judaism. Generally, I do this as a way of preserving, or reincarnating some aspects of Orthodox Judaism that have been neglected or ignored. I think a broader approach to Orthodox Judaism is becoming increasingly necessary. If the artificial guardians that make our culture so unnecessarily narrow can be slain, I think that they should be slain. This does not mean that one who loves the things about the narrow culture must cease to exist in his paradigm of Orthodox Judaism. But it does mean that the door must be open to the way others practice.</p>
<p>Every Orthodox Jew realizes that there are many ways to serve God within the confines of halacha. But some people are more myopic about their versions. They think that theirs is the only path. This is a toxic idea. It’s something that we should all seek to destroy. I try to limit my harshest criticism for those who fall into this category.</p>
<p>I’ve also been accused of being very careful not to say anything overtly offensive, yet some readers can detect a tone of negativity or criticism. It’s true that I am very careful not to talk my way into the Kefira Korner™. It’s also true that there might be some hostility in my tone. But that hostility is not toward God or Torah or even Orthodox Judaism. It’s always directed at particular people or ideas that warrant a harsh tone. But because so much is left unsaid, readers may have the right to assume that my tone is indicative of an overall indifference or callousness towards frumkeit. This is regrettable. Luckily, it&#8217;s inaccurate.</p>
<p>Finally we get to one specific issue. That is the fallibility of Chazal and the rest of our rabbinic figures. For some people this is a very touchy issue. Often, these people know in the back of their minds that Chazal made mistakes about things but would prefer not to see these errors because they undermine their <em>Emunas Chachamim</em>. Similarly, they will say that exposing human error undermines the halachic process.</p>
<p>Because this issue has been raised in such a specific manner, I can address it head on. Our Divine Torah requires interpretation. All interpretation is human. All of it. If it was Divine, it would be Torah. If it would be Torah, there would be no dispute. However, our schools and yeshivos often teach that Torah is Divine and all the words of Chazal and all subsequent rabbis is Divine as well. It could be that they were Divinely inspired or a more halachic view that whichever streams of halacha that have endured are results of hashgacha and thus have the Divine Seal of Approval. That is the more mainstream view.</p>
<p>There are two valid approaches here. The flaw with the second approach is that there are too many problems with assuming that rabbis never made mistakes. The holes are easy to poke. But the question is why is it worthwhile to poke those holes? Fine. The rabbis made mistakes, but what social or religious value can there be in calling attention to these mistakes?</p>
<p>I believe that there is a grave danger in perpetuating this myth. Firstly, because it is easily disproved, it creates an unsustainable <em>Emunas Chachamim</em>. The entire premise of this part of this essay is based on the assumption that even when a myth is a myth, pointing out that it&#8217;s a myth creates a problem. Well, if we would just stop teaching the myth, problem solved! But more substantively, the danger I see in perpetuating this myth is found in the ever expanding doctrine of Daas Torah. Those two words meant something entirely different a few decades ago. But rabbinic infallibility has taken on epic meaning in our times. For many, it has come to represent the very ideas that prevent our most pressing issues from being addressed. It stops all conversation. It turns our observance into Gadolatry instead of service of God. We can do better. Knowing that a rabbi can err is actually the best way to ensure that mistakes do not get integrated into Orthodox Judaism. That is how science works. If we are able to question, challenge, even criticize, then we have a chance at arriving at something akin to truth. But relying on one or even a few unassailable people for everything is a terrible way to seek truth.</p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism is not about following the words of infallible humans. It&#8217;s about using the wisdom of fallible humans to serve God. The reason our way of practicing Orthodox Judaism today carries any cachet is because almost every idea has been scrutinized and discussed before it was adopted as normative practice. It&#8217;s obvious to anyone who reads halachic literature that this was the way things were always done. We can&#8217;t stop now. It clear to me that this is the way to strengthen the chain of our tradition. By critically approaching our Judaism, we add vibrancy to Torah and fortify our Judaism.</p>
<p>So when I tweak the Daas Torahniks or demonstrate that our Gedolim actually believed themselves to be fallible, I am in effect advocating for a more vibrant, nuanced version of Orthodox Judaism. I am not advocating for abandonment of Torah and Mitzvos. There is a system I believe in strongly. Not every critique will include my vision for an alternative. But know that it&#8217;s there. Know that I have either already written about it or will someday in the future. If you want an article sooner, just ask. I frequently find inspiration to write on topics that are suggested to me.</p>
<p>Most of all, join the discussion. Don&#8217;t simply eavesdrop. Be part of the conversation. Ask me for the context or the background. I prefer being challenged by good questions to being ignored. Let&#8217;s continue talking to each other and not about each other. Let&#8217;s create a place for sophisticated discussion about our Judaism that will take us into the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/url.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5781" title="why" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/url.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In less than four years, this blog has grown from a minor blip on the radar (I got 6500 hits in the first six months) to a substantial, engaging community of interested and interesting people (I get 6500 hits a day sometimes). Reflecting on my time as a blogger, I can see how my voice has changed, adjusted, and adapted to meet varying needs and wants as well as my (somewhat fluid) views on Torah and orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>If you look back at the articles from 2008 and 2009 you&#8217;ll see that they are a bit different than the articles I write these days. Not significantly different, just different enough to notice. But as I grew in my rabbinic position at Pacific Jewish Center, and journeyed through law school, and learned more Torah, and accumulated more experiences I found a voice. But this voice was not just my own voice. It was the voice of many Jews from every single kind of background that I have come in contact with through the last few years. (Similarly, many people are comfortable in my shul, while they are not comfortable in other orthodox shuls.) I am not saying I speak for everyone or even most people. Rather, there are enough people who find their own voice coming through the words when they read this blog.</p>
<p>It was never my intention to create controversy. It was never my intention to bash or insult large swaths of people. That may happen from time to time but that&#8217;s not the goal. In fact, I would rather do without it.</p>
<p><span id="more-5772"></span></p>
<p>Yet, I do find myself the target of criticism, usually from the charedi side of things, but often enough from the more liberal communities of orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. As a committed orthodox Jew, I recognize that I am easy pickings for more liberal Jews. But the criticism from the charedi side is more significant and has a greater impact on my reputation and career. I would therefore like to clarify and explain a few things to set the record straight.</p>
<p>My goal with this blog is to increase <em>kavod shamayim</em><em> </em>and <em>kiddush Hashem</em>. My goal is to nudge orthodox Judaism just enough to be more inclusive, more welcoming, and more attractive, to non-orthodox <em>and</em> to orthodox Jews. My goal is to inspire positive change that is permissible within the context of halacha. My goal is to facilitate conversations about the issues that are important to orthodox Jews and to everyone else. My goal is to increase communication between all people. My goal is to inspire people to find their voice within orthodox Judaism. My goal is to provide<strong> positive Jewish experiences</strong> to as many people as I possibly can.</p>
<p>Sometimes this means talking frankly and candidly about flaws in our communities. Sometimes that means challenging our leadership. Sometimes that means asking questions that deserve good answers. Sometimes that means finding ourselves in strange alliances with people who seem so far from our beliefs. Sometimes it means disagreeing with people far greater than me in Torah and with much more life experience than me. Sometimes it means making mistakes.</p>
<p>Am I a troublemaker? Should I be banned or excommunicated?</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The style of orthodox Judaism that I try to endorse and promote is a similar style to that of my rebbeim, my grandfathers and my father. My rebbeim never told me not to ask question and challenge. I was taught to respect the words of great rabbis and I do. But respect does not mean blind adherence. Sometimes it means challenging. After all, if their words are to be revered and respected, their words should be scrutinized as well. And if the forum was a newspaper or magazine 50 years ago, the forum today is the Internet. I apologize if people think the Internet is a <em>moshav leitzim</em> and a place where it is impossible to have a serious conversation. I think that has been disproved a million times over.</p>
<p>My family tradition has always been to be activists and involved in community growth. My grandfathers were engaged in the secular world, formally educated, and also great Torah scholars and influencers in the broad orthodox Jewish community. The Internet is a natural place for this kind of work to take place in 2012. I get emails, messages, calls, texts, comments, and snail mail, acknowledging and thanking me for this blog. The correspondence comes from every type of Jew and from all over the world. The Internet makes this possible. This blog is a community and it is new kind of community that didn&#8217;t exist 15 years ago. That doesn&#8217;t make it wrong.</p>
<p>My hope is that by creating this space for important conversations we can all make our claim in the future of orthodox Judaism. We all have a stake in it. We all can have our voice in it.</p>
<p>There is a method to the madness. I try my best to invite good discussion whether it is on the blog comments, on Facebook (there&#8217;s almost always an equal, if not better, comment thread over there), the coffee rooms, or at your Shabbos table. I try very hard not to cross the line of impropriety. Reasonable people may disagree over where that line is. But I do have a line and I do try to stay on one side of that line. (The safe side.) I welcome criticism and suggestions. Those of you who have reached out to me know that I respond to your positive emails and your negative emails.</p>
<p>I think orthodox Judaism is great. We have stories of unbelievable heroism and leadership in our communities. Many people are living beautiful orthodox Jewish lives. There are books that have been written about these people and their stories. I don&#8217;t think I need to reiterate how much goodness exists in our communities but I will do it anyway. Go to any orthodox Jewish community. You will find open homes, open hearts, and disproportionate virtue and charity. We are getting some things right and when we are doing well it means we are doing incredibly well. We can sit back and enjoy how awesome we are or we can try and tweak the things that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>My point is that I am not trying to destroy anything. The things that it may seem like I am trying to destroy are really just what I believe to be cancers that are destroying us a people. Sometimes chemo is the only solution. Whatever is being attacked, is being attacked with the ultimate goal that the body come out stronger and healthier than it was before the problems were attacked. Sometimes the conversations get a bit heated. Passion should not be confused with disrespect. Passion means that the writer cares. Sometimes I write objectively but other times I write persuasively and it is those times that passion can be misunderstood.</p>
<p>I remain committed to the ideals of passionate orthodox Judaism. I want Judaism to thrive. I want it to grow. I want more people to find joy and satisfaction in orthodox Judaism. These are my goals as a person and a rabbi. These are the same goals that I have for this blog.</p>
<p>Thank you all for making this blog a fun and education place to gather together on the Internet. I hope this post explains at least a little bit about what I trying to do over here. It may seem like it has no rhyme or reason or that I am just trying to push buttons. In fact, there is a rhyme and reason and while I trying to push buttons, the buttons are the ones that I hope will bring improvement and increased vitality to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I hope that if you are a reader of this blog and encounter people who criticize me or the things that are discussed here, this post will be able to quell their fears and reassure them that we are all on the same team. I truly believe in a future where we can all get along and everyone can find their place in orthodox Judaism. I am just trying my best to leave a little space for the out-of-the-box thinkers and non-conformists. We need all types in <em>Klal Yisrael</em>. Let&#8217;s just make sure there is a place for everyone.</p>
<p>Classically, Judaism believes that there is good and evil potential in everyone and everything. Nothing is intrinsically good or evil. The Internet presents us with incredible opportunities and tremendous power. If we are to ignore it and pretend it does not exists we may be wasting a great Heavenly gift. A place on the Internet full of fruitful and thoughtful discussion is a kiddush Hashem. I endeavor to make this blog just such a place. It may not make everyone happy all the time, but I am hopeful that we can agree on mutual goals and ideals and our meeting of the minds in those places allows for the kind of productive discussion on this blog and on many others.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to be the problem. We just want to be part of the solution.</p>
