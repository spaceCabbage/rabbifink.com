				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7073" alt="Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237-200x300.jpeg" width="200" height="300" /></a>The Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Israel, Rabbi Aharon Feldman has apologized to MK Rabbi Dov Lipman for calling him a <em>rasha.</em> In his apology, R&#8217; Feldman says that he believes the MK Lipman is <em>&#8220;l&#8217;shem shamayim&#8221;</em> and wants what is best for the Jewish people including the charedim in Israel. Because of these revelations, R&#8217; Feldman says that MK Lipman is misguided but not a <em>rasha.</em></p>
<p>R&#8217; Feldman makes the case that MK Lipman is wrong or misguided using traditional Torah sources and accepted wisdom in the yeshiva world. He very emphatically disagrees with MK Lipman but the discourse is civil.</p>
<p>Initially, I was hurt and saddened when I read R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s original remarks. While I can&#8217;t say I am thrilled with his position on this issue, there is something positive that I can say. R&#8217; Aharon Feldman showed the charedi world what it means to be an honest <em>eved Hashem.</em> It takes guts to apologize. It always takes guts. But it takes ten times more guts when you are the Rosh Yeshiva of a prominent Torah institution and the subject of your apology is <em>persona non grata </em>in the charedi world. It could not have been easy to apologize but it was the right thing to do and for that I admire R&#8217; Feldman.</p>
<p>Further, R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s apology and argument is so different than the other recent charedi responses and rhetoric towards MK Lipman. It was respectful and somewhat positive. Again, I don&#8217;t love R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s position on this issue. But I do appreciate how stark the difference is between the way he is handling this and the way some other charedim are handling it.<span id="more-7072"></span></p>
<p>Look, it is easy to be cynical and say that R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s speech was more of the same. But I see it differently. There was some dignity in this dispute and it was not laced with disgust and revulsion. It&#8217;s sad to say it, but that is a huge improvement and I hope that those who jumped on R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s bandwagon when he called MK Lipman a <em>rasha</em> are just as quickly jumping on his bandwagon of toning down the rhetoric.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t intend to come off as one with a bias of low expectations. Not at all. I am simply comparing what R&#8217; Feldman said and did in his apology with what I have been hearing from pseudonymous writers on frum sites and their commenters. It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air and I applaud R&#8217; Feldman for doing what was right.</p>
<p>One level deeper, it gives me hope that others can see that R&#8217; Feldman is simply trying to do what is <em>emes.</em> He is not attempting character assassination for the sake of a cause. He thinks MK Lipman is wrong and told him so. But he sounds reasonable. I think the difference stems from something he alluded to in his apology. R&#8217; Feldman said that MK Lipman is a <em>shogeig</em> and a <em>shogeig</em> isn&#8217;t a <em>rasha.</em> What he means is that he is looking at his through a lens of halacha. He is not looking at it through a lens of pure politics.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are counter arguments to R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s opinion. My point here is not to say that R&#8217; Feldman made his arguments so convincingly that the discussion is closed. Rather, the way R&#8217; Feldman spoke to MK Lipman means that there is hope the discussion is still open.</p>
