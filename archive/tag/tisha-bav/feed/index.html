				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The biggest challenge we have on Tisha B&#8217;Av is relating to its sadness. Our Judaism is so upbeat and so positive that it can be hard to find the inner strength to be sad on this day. We are more Slabodka than Navardhok. We are more Chasidishe than Litvishe. We are more Mesillas Yesharim than Shaarei Teshuva.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s contemporary Judaism. Asceticism is out. Joyful service is in. Eating is the new fasting.</p>
<p>As such, it can be difficult to muster the requisite sadness and appropriate mood for Tisha B&#8217;Av. I struggle with this every year and I know many others who do as well.</p>
<p>Since the time around last Tisha B&#8217;Av I have been stuyding and teaching Daf Yomi. I think that the daily Talmudic study may have a secret that can inform our Tisha B&#8217;Av experience this year.<span id="more-7384"></span></p>
<p>One of the beautiful things about studying Talmud is appreciating the way the text immerses you in the conversation. The reader is not a passive bystander. The reader is an active participant in the discussion. Sometime we are the Tanna Kamma. Then we are the voice of the Gemara that challenges that Tanna. Then we become the the various Amoraim who answer these challenges. All along the way we take on the persona and logical faculties of the speaker in the text. One second you&#8217;re R&#8217; Yehoshua, the next second you&#8217;re R&#8217; Elazar, the next minute you are Abaye, and immediately thereafter you are Rava. We read their words and we strive to understand their thinking.</p>
<p>I find this exhilarating. Every other book I have read or studied tells you what to think. The Talmud asks you to join along in thinking with it.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7385" alt="Religious Jews Mark The Anniversary Of The Destruction Of The Temple Of Solomon" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6c3d94e69c3621fb25789283f4103745.jpg" /></p>
<p>This Tisha B&#8217;Av we can try to do the same thing with the Tisha B&#8217;Av liturgy. We hear the haunting intonations of Eicha. Instead of trying to feel pain that is so fleeting for us today, let&#8217;s try to empathize with the pain of Jeremiah. His pain leaps off the page. Can we hear the agony in his words? Can we step into his shoes and experience his torment?</p>
<p>We can do the same thing we read the Kinos. They are obscure and arcane. But they can also give us a window into the hearts and minds of their composers. When we read the poetic dirges written centuries ago we must transport ourselves to that day in history. We must try to feel what they are feeling when they wrote these searing laments. We may not be able to feel our own pain, but we can all empathize with our ancestors and feel their pain.</p>
<p>I propose that we treat the Tisha B&#8217;Av liturgy the way we treat the Talmud. We read the lines of the Talmud and we put ourselves in the place of their speaker. We can do the same thing on Tisha B&#8217;Av. We can become Jeremiah, we can become HaKalir, we can live Eicha and the Kinos vicariously.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we feel their pain, it will awaken the dormant pain in our hearts this Tisha B&#8217;Av. And maybe if we awaken that latent pain found deep in the recesses our soul, we will merit to have that pain replaced with the joy of a time when Tisha B&#8217;Av is a day of celebration and no longer a day of mourning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/800px-Francesco_Hayez_017.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5882" title="800px-Francesco_Hayez_017" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/800px-Francesco_Hayez_017-300x219.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="219" /></a>There are many reasons to mourn on Tisha B&#8217;Av. Historically, our holy Temples in Jerusalem were destroyed. As a result we lost the great spiritual connection present in those Temples.</p>
<p>Perhaps more significantly, the destruction of the Temple was a very harsh message from God. The message was that we did not deserve a Temple. God was telling us that we lost the right to a Temple.</p>
<p>Sometimes the punishment is not as bad as being told that we deserve to be punished.</p>
<p>As vital as the Temple was a place for worship and symbolic of the relationship between the Almighty and His people, it was not destined to last forever. A long exile was part of the Plan. At this point in history, the Jewish people have experienced more time in exile than we have experienced in the Land of Israel with a Temple or Tabernacle (~2000 vs. ~1300). We are charged with the responsibility to make the most of our time in exile but it can start to feel like we belong in exile.<span id="more-5881"></span></p>
<p>Especially now, with the Land of Israel flourishing with more Jews in our homeland than any time in the last 2000 years, it can be difficult to feel exile. We have Israel. But what we don&#8217;t have is unity. We don&#8217;t have our national symbol and place of worship  - the Temple. But we are accustomed to all that. We don&#8217;t feel like anything is missing.</p>
<p>Tisha B&#8217;Av is a day that reminds us, very stridently, that we are not at home, we are in exile and that even those of us in the Land of Israel are guests in our home. This is not the way things are supposed to be. On Tisha B&#8217;Av we proclaim the words of the prophet Jeremiah and others through whom we express our pain of being away from home. We express our pain even if we have a hard time feeling it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest tragedy of this long, dark, exile is that our collective memory of life in the Land of Israel with our Temple is so vague and blurry that it is hard for us to really pine for it. We are so accustomed to being persecuted, wandering, and homeless that we can hardly recall where our communal aspirations should lie. This creates two opposite forces. On the one hand we don&#8217;t truly feel like we want out of this exile. On the other hand, when the exile doesn&#8217;t challenge us with persecution and death we are confused about how to feel.</p>
<p>Tisha B&#8217;Av tells us how to feel. It refreshes our collective memory. It reminds us of our communal pain and anguish over the our loss of the Temple and of the destruction caused by the exile. Tisha B&#8217;Av is the reset button on our mourning over the events that changed Judaism forever. Our great grandparents cried and died for their great grandchildren who would be exiled. That is us. They cried and died for us. Perhaps some of their tears were for a generation that would forget what we lost; a generation like ours.</p>
<p>It may feel strange to try to force ourselves to feel something we do not feel. But the truth is that we do it all the time. When we cry during a movie, or while reading a book, we are artificially creating our own emotions. Tisha B&#8217;Av is at the very least the same kind of experience. Even if we do not feel the anguish of Tisha B&#8217;Av on our own, we need to articially create that feeling. Pay attention during Eicha. Hear the broken spirit of its imagery. Use the Kinnos to conjure up the appropriate emotions. If none of that works, find something else that will do it.</p>
<p>Once a year our collective consciousness needs to be shocked into action. We need to remember. We need to feel the pain. Tisha B&#8217;Av is that day. United as one, the Jewish community remembers together what we need to remember.</p>
<p>Let us use this day to realign our compass and continue our journey through this exile until we reach the ultimate goal of the final and complete redemption speedily in our days. Let us feel the pain in the hope that we will no longer need to feel this pain ever again.</p>

These two men are famous for their on the field accomplishments as well as their gifts of speech. Both Sanders and Sharpe have had successful careers as commentators and for good reason. These guys can talk.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that their induction speeches were highly anticipated.</p>
<p>The reviews of their speeches are in and they are mixed. I am not going to grade their performances, but I do have something to say about the content of their speeches.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2011/8/8/2349026/deion-sanders-shannon-sharpe-pro-football-hall-of-fame-speech" target="_blank">Both spent considerable time talking about their childhood</a>. They both came from poor, disadvantaged homes. Both were slightly embarrassed by their upbringing. More importantly, both credited their difficult youth as motivation to succeed in the NFL. They wanted &#8220;out&#8221; so badly that were willing to do whatever it took to become the best players they could be.<span id="more-4497"></span> Luckily for them, they made it.</p>
<p>It seemed from their words that despite all their success, the pain and agony of their childhood has not been assuaged by their mammoth success. They still feel the trauma of their early years even though they made it out. And they made it out in a huge way.</p>
<p>It takes a lot to overcome adversity. Overcoming difficult circumstances is also a tremendous motivator. There are few forces that drive a person to success more than necessity. The need to get out is so powerful that it provides super talented people with a glimmer of hope that they can escape their hellish lives.</p>
<p>People born with less adversity are harder to motivate. Why work as hard when life is easy? Why try to change things if things are just dandy? There are far fewer professional athletes from wealthy homes than from tough neighborhoods. It is simple to understand. When you need a ticket out, you&#8217;ll do anything you can to punch that ticket.</p>
<p>For Ashkenazik Jews, our current predicament is unfamiliar. For hundreds of years we have been victims. Violence, segregation, ostracization and victimization described our existence. It boiled over during the Holocaust but was horrible many times and for many years before the Holocaust as well.</p>
<p>For all those years we desperately wanted to get out. Tisha B&#8217;Av was easy to feel. Our lives were so difficult and our situations were so dire that it motivated us to experience Tisha B&#8217;Av with tears and genuine desire for our Temple to be rebuilt. Our daily existence justified an intense desire to &#8220;make the new days into the days of old&#8221;.</p>
<p>There was a transitional period as Jews made their way to America. My great-grandfather quit his job every Friday because he refused to work on Shabbos. Eventually, his sisters kicked him out of his home. That was America in the early days.</p>
<p>But now we are comfortable. We have come a long way. Jews live middle to upper class lives in America. We have religious freedom. Kosher food is ubiquitous. We can visit all the important places in the Land of Israel. It is easy to study Torah. We have it good. Real good. Maybe too good.</p>
<p>Where is our motivation?</p>
<p>How are we to work up the emotions necessary to feel Tisha B&#8217;Av?</p>
<p>It can be tough.</p>
<p>I propose that as hard and as painful as it may be, we should contemplate the social issues that plague Judaism. We need to consider the difficulty of the orthodox and especially non-orthodox communities in maintaining our religious identity in such a free world. We can think about how freedom has given rise to a slew of new, first world problems.</p>
<p>What I am saying, is we should look as critically as we can at contemporary Judaism. Even though the glass is much more than half full and for 353 days a year we need to appreciate our good fortune, on Tisha B&#8217;Av we need to look at the glass as almost completely empty.</p>
<p>That is what we are mourning. We don&#8217;t have it all. And we want it all.</p>
<p>Once a year we can focus on the negative. We can remind ourselves that although we are much more advantaged than our grandparents were, we are still a desolate nation living at best, a halfway existence.</p>
<p>It can be hard to do. But no one said Tisha B&#8217;Av was supposed to be easy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/36-Kotel-Western-Wall-Old-City-Jerusalem1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2645" title="Kotel (Western Wall), Old City Jerusalem" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/36-Kotel-Western-Wall-Old-City-Jerusalem-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></a>At sundown this evening, the 9th of Av, Jews all around the world will begin a 25 hour period of mourning. We mourn the loss of the great Temple in Jerusalem, and all that it symbolized. We lament the loss of our national unity and the special Temple connection. We hope and pray for a complete redemption and the messianic era of peace, harmony and sprirituality.</p>
<p>(Read my thoughts on Tisha B&#8217;Av from last year: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/30/mourning-the-living-on-the-9th-of-av/">Mourning The Living On The 9th of Av</a>)</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with the custom to fast for 25 hours as a sign of our mourning. We suffer to try and feel what we are missing. For many people, Tisha B&#8217;Av is a fast day and nothing else.</p>
<p>That is tragic.<span id="more-2644"></span></p>
<p>Over on DovBear, (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/07/gods-thoughts-on-tisha-bav.html">God&#8217;s Thoughts on Tisha B&#8217;Av</a>) my good friend Henoch has posted a very insightful anecdote <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2307.htm" target="_blank">from Zecharia Chapter 7</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the second Temple was being rebuilt, the Jews had been keeping the 4 fast days related to the destruction for the last 70 years. It occurred to residents of Bavel that perhaps these fasts were obsolete. After all, the Temple was being rebuilt, so why would they continue to mourn over its destruction? They assembled a delegation to go to Jerusalem where the halachic question would be brought to the leadership that still included Neviim. The answer given by God through Zechariah Hanavi is quite surprising and would be considered completely inappropriate had anyone else given that answer.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>At first the question of whether to fast or not, is ignored. Then Zechariah said in the name of God that when Jews eat at times that they deem appropriate, or fast when they decide to fast, they do so because it is what they think will serve their own interests. It isn’t necessarily for the right reasons. Zechariah essentially states that our idea of fasting misses the mark and even questions its’ sincerity. He then goes further and says in the name of God what would be a more proper approach to the subject. He says that the correct approach to this problem is to<br />
“Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.”<br />
Being that the Jews ignored these basic ideas, they were exiled and scattered across the world.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>God is looking at us and saying, it is quite simple, and it has always been quite simple. I don’t want false piety or even grand programs that are limited to fasting and davening. If you want to do them, that is your decision. But don’t lose sight of what I want. God says “I want honesty, compassion and love”.</p></blockquote>
<p>We cannot allow the secondary customs and practices to become primary. We cannot become so wrapped up in our customs, such as fasting, and forget the direct commandments from God.</p>
<p>We know what we need to do.</p>
<p>Please do not merely fast this year on Tisha B&#8217;Av. Take the lessons of Zecharia 7 and try to be the best we can be in all of our actions.</p>

One of my primary responsibilities was to lead large groups of Jewish college students on inspiring trips to Israel.</p>
<p>Of course, the personal inspiration for me, was very often, greater than the inspiration for some of the students.</p>
<p>One episode has inspired me since the moment it occurred and it is directly related to today&#8217;s Tisha B&#8217;Av fast.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span>We always were sure to take the students on the <a href="http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=116" target="_blank">Tunnel Tours of the Western Wall</a>. For me, it was incredible to see the beauty and grandeur of the gigantic white stones at the original base of the Western Wall. The Talmud in Sukkah tells of the beauty of the Second Temple that Herod rebuilt. It is hard to imagine such beauty when we see the above ground Western Wall today. Erosion and time have taken its physical beauty. But underground the stones are a pristine white and appear good as new.</p>
<p>Our tour guide was always the world renowned Esther Schlisser (who has since passed May Her Memory Be Blessed). Esther Schlisser was a one of a kind woman who took these tours very seriously. She allowed no talking, no photographs of her and she brazenly single-handedly led us through the Arab Quarter at the end of the tour during the second intifada.</p>
<p>We began the tour sitting in front of a really cool model of Herod&#8217;s Second Temple and with the magic of technology it transforms into the current Old City layout. The route of the tour took us deep down to the lower Western Wall base stones and along the Wall below the Arab Quarter. What we see of the Wall today, is a fraction of the size of the original Wall.</p>
<p>We finally arrived at my favorite spot. There is a section of floor from the Second Temple era that has been excavated and this is where Esther had us all sit on floor. I really enjoy touching history, and walking and sitting on the floor where our grandparents sat 2000 years ago is very powerful for me.</p>
<p>Esther then begins to tell us where we are sitting and the great men who must have walked these same cobble stones. She then begins to cry. Esther tells us the following (paraphrased to the best of memory):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;These stones are alive!</em></p>
<p><em>My husband died many years ago. When he died I was sad. I cried for days, for months, but eventually, I began to heal and I no longer cry for my husband. This is because my husband is dead and we cannot cry over something that is dead forever. I miss him terribly, but I do not cry.</em></p>
<p><em>However, I come to this spot, the floor right in front of the Western Wall of the Second Temple at least once a day for the past 10 years. Every single time I come here, I cry. I cry that we are exiled and that we cannot see the Temple in its true grandeur and I cry that we are at the mercy of the nations of the world and we cannot rule ourselves as per the Torah&#8217;s command. Jews have been crying here for centuries. We will continue to cry until we are redeemed from this exile.</em></p>
<p><em>There is only one way to explain this. The stones are alive. The Wall is alive. There is a soul in the bricks that lives. Its voice is small, it is weak, but it is alive and that is how we can cry centuries of tears for a destroyed Temple. The Temple may have been destroyed but still, it lives.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A very powerful experience and one I think of very often.</p>
<p>On this Tisha B&#8217;Av, remember that we are not crying over a dead Temple. If it were so, we would have stopped crying eons ago. The stones are alive. They are kept alive by the promise that we will see a Third Temple. They are kept alive by the souls of the Jewish people yearning for their Temple to be rebuild. And they are kept alive by the tears we cry on Tisha B&#8217;Av every single year.</p>
