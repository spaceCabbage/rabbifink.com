				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6650" alt="ap_newtown_sandy_hook_school_Sign_balloons_thg_121215_wg" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ap_newtown_sandy_hook_school_Sign_balloons_thg_121215_wg-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" />There are no words to properly describe the horror of last friday&#8217;s shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. I was a wreck the entire Friday. My job requires me to be strong and put on a good face over Shabbos. I did the best I could. My sermon was heavily influenced by my feelings about the tragedy. After Shabbos and on Sunday and Monday, it was still too hard to get through full sentences when reading or talking about the tragedy. It was impossible to watch the news.</p>
<p>I did talk a little about the tragedy on Facebook and tried to facilitate some discussion. But it was too hard to write about it in this space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still hard, but less so at this point. That&#8217;s the blessing of our ability to forget. But it&#8217;s also a curse to be able forget if we don&#8217;t do what we can to prevent future tragedy.</p>
<p>I have a few things to say on the tragedy and they are not really related. So please excuse the unrelated points in this post.<span id="more-6649"></span></p>
<p><strong>I. Children</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to read about parents losing their children in this senseless shooting and not be so thankful every day that our children (or your brothers and sisters, or your nieces and nephews) are safe. It makes us pause and reflect on how precious our children are to us. It makes us want to shower our children with love and keep them safe and happy. It makes us forget any <em>tzaar gidul banim </em>that we may have felt. All we want to do is reassure our children that they will be okay and that we will always be there for them. People mean it when they say &#8220;hug your children a little more&#8221; after a tragedy like this. I know I did.</p>
<p><strong>II. Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>We need better mental health awareness and care in this country. This area of medicine is always evolving and what we know now is so much more than what we knew years ago. We can do more than ever for people who need help. But unfortunately, there is a very negative stigma attached to those who need mental health care. We push people away from it as long as possible to avoid the stigma and then it can sometimes be too late to make a real difference. So while more care is important, it is even more important that those who need and receive care are not stigmatized.</p>
<p>A few hundred years ago we would have said that these people were possessed by the devil or a dybbuk. Now we know better. But we need to act differently and not see them as horrible people, rather they are people with challenges just like everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>III. Empathy</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge America faces as a society is that we do not share a common ancestry or ethnicity. It is also a huge blessing and makes America a beautiful melting pot. But because we are not as connected as people in other nations our sense of community suffers. People feel isolated. We live very manufactured lives. Most of us are not involved in the process of producing stuff, we just consume stuff. We are detached from our communities and neighbors. This has several harmful effects.</p>
<p>First, it means that if the neighbor&#8217;s kid is acting strange or we think he needs help, we don&#8217;t say anything. It&#8217;s not our business, we say. We are not comfortable poking into other people&#8217;s lives. Privacy is great and I think people should mind their own business. The problem is that &#8220;their own business&#8221; is so narrow that it only includes a very small number of people. I think it&#8217;s healthy when people are able to have relationships with others that change their business into your own business. If you think about it, my brother&#8217;s business is my business. That&#8217;s because we care about each other. We love each other. What he does matters to me. But I don&#8217;t feel that way about my neighbor. Certainly, some bounderies are necessary for a functioning society, but I think we need to care about each other more. When we think someone needs help, we need to have the courage to say something and we also need to have the courage to hear it and not lash out against those trying to help.</p>
<p>Second, it means that someone can get to the point that they are so isolated that they can shoot children and not care. A person who feels empathy and connects with others in their community does not kill people in that community. This is a general solution that could solve so much of our crime. People don&#8217;t harm people that they care about. We need to expand the group of people of whom we care about.</p>
<p>We need to figure out why mass shootings are a uniquely American phenomena. I think this might be part of the reason. Judaism very strongly promotes creating this kind of empathetic society. We need to do a better job amongst ourselves to play our role as a light unto the nations.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Guns</strong></p>
<p>I am<b> </b>not going to discuss arguments for or against increased gun control laws. It&#8217;s a very, very, very complicated issue and neither side of the debate has a viable solution.</p>
<p>However, I have a different observation. Let&#8217;s assume that increased or decreased gun control laws won&#8217;t significantly affect future mass shootings. There is still an argument to be made that some people don&#8217;t want to &#8220;live in a place that embraces / bans guns&#8221;. In other words, sometimes the law is not what makes the difference, it&#8217;s the principle of the law. Pro-gun people will say &#8220;I want to live in a place where citizens can have guns and have the right to defend themselves against violent crime&#8221;. Anti-gun people will say &#8220;I want to live in a place where gun ownership is taboo&#8221;.</p>
<p>But I think this argument is flawed. We should all want to live in a place where all kinds of people want to live. Isolating some or many of them is selfish. One will hear similar arguments about gay marriage. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if people are gay. I just don&#8217;t want to live in a place that being gay is considered normal and a law that recognizes gay marriage does just that&#8221;. This argument is also abhorrent. We should all want to live in a place that gives every non-criminal or non-danger to society a comfortable place to exist. I feel the same way about this genre of argument regarding guns.</p>
<p>The only thing that I will say about the gun debate in our country is that it has become a very partisan issue and that precludes meaningful discussion. I don&#8217;t think there is any one event that would sway an ardent gun advocate to the other side of the debate, lest they change ideology and vice versa. More mass shootings turn into arguments for more guns and just as passionately against guns.</p>
<p>I will just say that owning a gun is a serious halachic issue, particularly if one has children in the home and must be discussed with a halachic authority or independently researched.</p>
<p><strong>V. Theodicy</strong></p>
<p>People will ask: How does God allow senseless murders? Why do tragedies like this happen?</p>
<p>There is only answer that is acceptable. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Any moron who says anything other than &#8220;we don&#8217;t know&#8221; needs to be stopped. Please.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Toldos<br />
A Total Education</h2>
<p>The beginning of Parshas Toldos reintroduces us to the birth of Yitzchak Avinu as it begins to detail his legacy as a second of our avos. The Parsha begins <em>v’eileh toldos Yitzchok ben Avraham, Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. The commentaries wonder what the second half of this pasuk is teaching us since the verse already explained that Avraham was Yitzchok’s father. Rashi quotes the chazal which tells us that <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em> is placed in the verse to teach us that Yitzchok looked exactly like his father and anyone who saw him knew that Avraham holid es Yitzchok, only Avraham can be his father (and not Avimelech, as the cynics of the generation had posited).</p>
<p>The Ibn Ezra takes a different approach. He explains the declaration that <em>Avraham holid es Yizchok</em> is referring to Yitzchok’s chinuch. Having fathered Yishmael, Avraham Avinu knew full well what it was like to have a child at risk. This time he took no chances. Not only did Avraham father Yitzchok but he also reared him to follow his teachings!<span id="more-4879"></span></p>
<p>In the nature versus nurture debate Avraham had discovered that both our needed. He thus faithfully transmitted all his values and priorities to Yitzchok his son. In every way Yitzchok was the physical and spiritual heir to Avraham Avinu. Similarly we are taught <em>kol milamid ben chaveiro kielu yaldo</em>. From the moment he was born, education, Yitzchok’s chinuch was Avraham Avinu’s full time preoccupation. He put all his <em>kochos leholid Yitzchok</em>, to guide, inspire and direct him on the path of greatness. And, with <em>siata dishmaya</em> he was blessed with success.</p>
<p>If we reflect back on nuances of the previous parsha leading up to and following Yitzchok’s birth we can mine some vital gems of chinuch priorities we can apply today. The Meforshim wonder what is the linkage between the destruction of Sedom and the <em>besurah tova</em> to Avraham and Sara that they will be blessed with a son? The three malachim traveled together, obviously there was a connection to their individual missions. Some explain first and foremost that Sedom had to be destroyed before Yitzchok could be born. There would be no way to rear a Yitzchok to the status of a <em>korban olah</em> with a Sedom in the environs. Thus when the malachim told Sara she would have a son they immediately set out to destroy that which could corrupt and derail all that Yitzchok could grow to be.</p>
<p>Avraham and Sarah understood this message and when the time came they exiled Yishmael from their home. A painful choice that with Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s blessing cleared the environment for Yitzchok to thrive. Even with his new beloved son growing up before his eyes, Avraham stuck to his own mission of outreach in kiruv. <em>Vayeeta eishal b’Vear Sheva</em>, and guest filled his home connecting to Hakadosh Baruch Hu (eishal was the acromyn for achila, shtiya velina). In this manner Yitzchok learned his <em>achrayus</em> to the klal and the need to spread the reality of Hashem Yisborach to a lost and pagan world.</p>
<p>Finally, after the <em>akaida</em> (22:19) Ibn Ezra wonders why the pasuk says vayashav Avraham el niarav, it seems that Avraham alone returned. Where was Yitzchok? The Ibn Ezra explains that following the <em>akaida</em>, the climactic moment of <em>gelui shchina</em> and <em>mesiras nefesh</em> when he was almost shechted, Yitzchok reached a tremendous <em>madraiga</em>. Avraham wanted to capitalize on the energy of the moment and therefore sent him to learn in the Yeshiva of Shem V’ever so that he could build on his inspiration and through <em>limud haTorah</em> to soar to even greater heights that would remain with him long after the inspiration had waned. <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. He directed every aspect of his total development, <em>b’gashmius, b’ruchniyus, b’middos, b’mitzvos, b’yiras shamayim ub’limud haTorah</em>.</p>
<p>This message should never be lost upon us. Chinuch must be the full time preoccupation especially in our challenging environment where the elimination of the Sedom’s of our world are simply impossible. As such, we must be even more careful in providing balance between removing corrupting influences from our home (Yishmael) and providing healthy opportunities to see others not committed to our values but who we confidently bring under our sphere of influence without the fear that we will be corrupted by them. As careful as Avraham was with the chinuch of Yitzchok, he did not put his head in the sand nor completely isolate him from the world at large. Finally, we must show our children that Talmud Torah is <em>kineged kulam</em>. It is not enough to be inspired but we must live inspired. Therefore at the moments of great spiritual peeks we must look towards our learning to be the glue that enables us to hold onto that moment and maximize its impact each and every day.</p>
<p>Like Avraham we cannot have a <em>hesech hadaas</em> from the chinuch of our children. We can learn from him. Iy”H as our children grow it will be said of each of us that we were holid each of our offspring.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/marriage.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4553" title="marriage" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/marriage.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>The NY Times has a great online section called &#8220;Room for Debate&#8221; in which they enlist writers from a spectrum of views to give their opinion on a particular issue.</p>
<p>The August 30, 2011 issue is: Should Parents Marry for the Kids?</p>
<p>The rules are predetermined. It is a given that a happy, healthy marriage is great for raising kids. The question is if cohabitation is just as good as a marriage for the purposes of raising kids.</p>
<p>The contributors all make good points. Some make bad points too.</p>
<p>One thread that seems to run throughout it is that we are a marriage-centric society. This automatically tips the scales in favor of marriage. But why is marriage better? What is it about saying &#8220;I do&#8221; that could make the relationship a better environment for raising kids?<span id="more-4552"></span></p>
<p>The simple answer is commitment. Marriage connotes a greater commitment than cohabitation. Divorces are painful, expensive and difficult. Couples that are married think twice (or more) before a divorce. The assumption is that if the couple is not getting a divorce they will work on the relationship to the point that it is a stable environment for raising children. However, cohabitation is much easier to sever. Just take your things and leave and it is over. Since it is easier to end the relationship, it is more likely that a child of cohabiting parents will end up living with one parent.</p>
<p>Worse than living with one parent is the shuffling of parent figures. Single parents are people too. They have a need for relationships and those needs can turn into several different partners over the course of a childhood. This can be traumatic.</p>
<p>Since cohabitation ends up being shorter than a marriage, more often than not, many of the contributors favor marriage for raising children.</p>
<p>This is a reasonable argument.</p>
<p>But I wonder, as do some of the contributors, what will happen if more and more people opt for cohabitation and our society becomes less marriage-centric? If it turns out that cohabitation is not an indicator of stability is there still an advantage that marriage can claim over cohabitation?</p>
<p>I believe the answer is yes.</p>
<p>A marriage is celebrated with a wedding. A wedding is a ceremony full of old rituals and traditions. A wedding takes something greater than the union and binds the couple. A religious marriage ceremony includes a member of the clergy and God Almighty. Even a secular marriage includes a judge and &#8220;The Law&#8221;.</p>
<p>It seems to me that invoking a greater power when forming a union of marriage gives the relationship a greater sense of purpose; something that makes the union holy or consecrated. I believe that is good for a relationship and even better for rearing a family.</p>
<p>Life is full of challenges. Placing a greater purpose than one&#8217;s personal needs into a relationship and a family can be a wonderful glue during difficult times. Anytime one begins to feel lost, knowing that there is a greater purpose to the most important things in one&#8217;s life, a spouse, children, family can be the greatest comfort in the darkest of times.</p>
<p>Marriage indicates that the relationship has something &#8220;more&#8221;. A wedding symbolizes this &#8220;more&#8221;. This &#8220;more&#8221; is priceless. It is also built into a marriage. Cohabitation can have it too. But getting married guarantees it.</p>

<p>I love LA.</p>
<p>Living in LA has its perks. You get great weather 300 days a year, really friendly neighbors, not too many bugs, plenty of excitement, just enough peace and quiet, the Lakers, and a Shul on the Beach (with a lucky Rabbi). But like any big city, there are some drawbacks to living in LA. The traffic, superficiality, the helicopters outside my window at 2 AM, the expensive housing, and the schmutz.</p>
<p>What is schmutz? Literally, it means dirt. But in this context it means dirty in a provocative or an overtly sexual manner. (© me this very second)<span id="more-2525"></span></p>
<p>Billboards rise like giant monoliths all over the city conveying their messages of sex, wealth and superficial, fleeting &#8220;happiness&#8221;. Now, most of the time I don&#8217;t complain about the billboards. Most billboards are innocuous enough. Some are a little too risque for my tastes, but it is nothing that disrupts my role as a decent human being or a parent. However, the over-hyped, flop of a movie called Sex and the City 2 has crossed the line of decency.</p>
<p>Sex and the City 2 billboards have overtaken the city.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look there is a big ol&#8217; billboard with the giant words &#8220;Sex and the City 2&#8243;.</p>
<p>The word sex can mean one than one thing. But sex &#8220;in the city&#8221; has only one meaning. Sex is not a bad word when used in the right context and in front of the right audience. An inappropriate audience would be a listener who is not old enough to understand what the word means, what it entails and when its use is appropriate. It would be wrong to have an open, frank conversation about sex with a young child.</p>
<p>A seven year old child can read well enough to see the word sex, but is not able to understand the word. There is just no way to have a conversation with a young child about sex. It is not age appropriate.</p>
<p>My son reads all the billboards (and also tons of books) and sometimes he even remembers the words on the billboards. Sometimes he repeats the things he sees on billboards. One day he was muttering to himself &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221;. He says &#8220;I can&#8217;t get it out of my head&#8221;, &#8220;what does it even mean?&#8221;.</p>
<p>&lt;Quick, change the subject&gt;</p>
<p>I know all about &#8220;Free Speech&#8221;. But when an audience does not have a choice or warning about the content of the speech it can be regulated. (<em>See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission_v._Pacifica_Foundation" target="_blank"><em>FCC v Pacifica</em></a><em>: The Court accepted as compelling, the government&#8217;s interests in 1) shielding children from patently offensive material, and 2) ensuring that unwanted speech does not enter one&#8217;s home. The Court stated that the FCC had the authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience, and gave the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency in different contexts</em>.) I think this rule could apply to billboards the same way it applies to radio.</p>
<p>The problem is that the speech is being directed at ANYONE who can read, with no warning and no way to shield a child from its message. That includes my son, who was reading simple words like &#8220;sex&#8221;  (or fox, or dad, or mom, or dog) at the age of 3! Do people think it is appropriate for 3 year old children to read words that will be impossible to define for them?! A provocative image is not going to prompt the kinds of questions that a word can. A kid sees a word and can read it, the kid wants to know what it means! What is one supposed to tell their kids?</p>
<p>If someone was asking me what to do, I would probably try and come up with something clever like, &#8220;it&#8217;s an adult word and when you get older you will understand what it means&#8221;. I guess that is the best I can do. But I find it offensive that young children don&#8217;t seem to be considered in what is permissible on a public billboard.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be some level of regulation beyond what exists now. Am I crazy?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/phpThumb_generated_thumbnailjpg.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2416" title="Green Children" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/phpThumb_generated_thumbnailjpg-300x284.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="170" /></a>I am really appreciative to MSNBC.com for the great publicity they gave our Shul with the Escape Into America photo-film as I mentioned here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/19/pacific-jewish-center-featured-on-msnbc-com/">Pacific Jewish Center Featured on MSNBC.com</a>. In addition, I now need to thank MSNBC for informing me of one of the craziest ideas I have ever heard.</p>
<p>Today is Earth Day and I have gone on record supporting conservation and many green initiatives. I believe conservation is an important part of a Torah lifestyle. (See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/22/earth-day/">Earth Day and Torah</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/15/green-post/">Green Post</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/07/the-story-of-bottled-water-review-important-video-way-over-the-top/">The Story of Bottled Water Review: Important Video, Way Over the Top</a>.)</p>
<p>While I love the idea of being environmentally conscious, to me it is just a factor in making choices. We all weigh our priorities when we make choices and Going Green is something to consider among other factors.<span id="more-2398"></span></p>
<p>To illustrate, if one was confronted with the theoretical choice of saving a life or making a more Green choice, it would be obscene to suggest that the Green choice would be more important than saving the life.</p>
<p>There is a woman who was on MSNBC who suggested that people consider the environmental effects of having children.</p>
<p>Yes, having children.</p>
<p>She has all sorts of lovely data about the carbon footprint each child makes on the environment and therefore she urges people to consider those factors while decided if they should become parents.</p>
<p>All with a straight face.</p>
<p>If one is uninterested in procreating that is their own personal choice. But to evangelize in favor of not bearing children because of a reason like &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; is, in my opinion, obscene. Thinking &#8220;green&#8221; does not mean that one should cease to think about anything other green. It means that we should consider the environment when making choices.</p>
<p>It barely even makes sense. I thought one of the main reasons people are concerned with the environment is so our children will have a safe and clean planet to enjoy. Who are we saving the planet for, if not for the next generation? Yes, I know, OTHERS will have children, but the point remains.</p>
<p>The right to bear and beget children is considered a Fundamental Right implicit in the Constitution. It&#8217;s a big deal. You don&#8217;t whiff on parenthood because of environmental concerns!</p>
<p>I recommend reading her article on <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2010-03-30-gink-manifesto-say-it-loud-im-childfree-and-im-proud/PALL" target="_blank">grist.org</a> to see if it makes any sense to you.</p>
<p>The best part is when she says &#8220;I have lots of friends with children&#8221;. That is just like the &#8220;I have lots of [insert minority] friends to &#8220;prove&#8221; you&#8217;re not a racist. It means nothing with regard to racism and it means nothing in this context as well.</p>
<p>Then she has the whole &#8220;parents lose out on so much&#8221; argument. What do parents miss out on? and I quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Time and emotional energy to invest in friendships and a romantic partnership.  Space to focus on a career or education or avocation.  Uninterrupted &#8220;grown-up&#8221; conversations.  Travel that&#8217;s truly impulsive or leisurely or adventurous (and never involves zoos).  Unpremeditated Saturday nights on the town and Sunday brunches out.  Opportunities for political or community engagement.  Stretches of quiet for reading or writing or relaxing.  A non-child-proofed, non-toy-strewn, non-goldfish-cracker-crumb-riddled home.  Eight peaceful, uninterrupted hours of sleep a night.  All without any guilt that one should be spending more quality time with the kid.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, parents do not &#8220;miss out&#8221; on all of that stuff. I know parents who enjoy many of those activities. Second, are these really compelling reasons? Those are the top things parents are missing? Sounds like trying to live a permanently immature lifestyle. Enjoy that.</p>
<p>Of course, Ms. Hymas would never want someone who was going to have children, not have children. This article is just for all the people who are on the fence or need something to use an excuse for why they are comfortable not having children. I just don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>Even that silly logo up top (taken from her article) is inane.</p>
<p>Also, it seems Ms. Hymas has a very immature view of the benefits of having children. And I quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, as a childfree person, I&#8217;ll miss out on a lot: The miracle of childbirth (though, truth be told, I don&#8217;t feel so bad about skipping that one).  The hilariously perceptive things that only kids say.  A respectable excuse for rereading the Harry Potter series.  The hope that my kid will be smarter and cooler and better looking than I ever was.  More boisterous holiday celebrations.  Someone to carry on the family name (assuming I won the arm-wrestling match with my partner over whose name the kid would actually get).  Maybe even the satisfaction of helping a child grow into a well-educated, well-adjusted adult, and the peace of mind of knowing there&#8217;s someone to take care of me in my old age.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Is she serious? These are the reasons people have children? To read Harry Potter? Hilarious things kids say? Seriously?</p>
<p>In my view, being a parent is great opportunity to grow as a human being. Learning how to give and love unconditionally and with no expectation of reciprocation is an opportunity. Not a burden. It is a chance to grow up and become a more complete person. Parenthood is about places another&#8217;s need ahead of your own sometimes. Being a parent means working on yourself to be a better person so your child will have a more complete role model. Sure, there are fun things about parenting too, but it is so much more than that.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of to make sense out of all this, is that when one has no core values one can imagine up any value to the primary value. I find this pretty offensive myself, but I think that is what happened to Ms. Hymas. In her worldview &#8220;going green&#8221; trumps procreation. I can&#8217;t imagine that is a very popular opinion but I guess it is possible.</p>
<p>Either that, or she&#8217;s just looking for attention and publicity. In that case, she got what she wanted.</p>

<p>It has been a while since I posted a video of Ozzie. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/11/take-a-smile-break-another-cute-baby-post/" target="_blank">The last video showed him crawling to his toys</a>. That was 4 months ago and boy how things have changed since then.</p>
<p>Even more has changed since I posted the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/21/i-could-not-help-myself/" target="_blank">first video of Ozzie playing a game</a>.</p>
<p>Babies change every day. They learn new things every day. We can learn a lot from babies.</p>
<p>Especially at this time of year as we attempt to make changes in our lives. Sometimes it is hard to make change, I think it can be helpful to observe others who are succesful at learning to behaviors and attitudes. Babies definitely change drastically from day to day and month to month and year to year.</p>
<p>As adults we need to &#8220;re-learn&#8221; how to change. We need to be more like babies to a certain extent. <span id="more-1329"></span>We must be hungry for knowledge, quick to change and ready to adapt.</p>
<p>Ozzie understands a lot of words and can respond accordingly. In this video he is asked to &#8220;Bang&#8221; and he does so very well. Ozzie also says his first word. Incredibly it is the same first word that Rami said, &#8220;Uh-Oh&#8221;. He says it when things fall. In fact he said it recently and we thought he was kidding, but later we realized that he was right, we had dropped something&#8230;</p>
<p>Sometimes kids know best!</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></strong></p>
<h1>An Eye on One’s Heart</h1>
<p>With the conclusion of the parsha Moshe finishes his soliloquy, beseeching Klal Yisrael to stay the course of Yiras Hashem and Shmiras Hamitzvos. After 40 years of leadership, the prose of Haazinu and indeed all of Sefer Devarim was to be his epitaph and our eternal inspiration.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that after Moshe Rabbeinu concluded his message he framed his final instructions by saying<span id="more-1325"></span>, “simu livavchem l’chol hadivarim asher anochi mei’id bachem hayom asher titzavum es bineichem lishmor la’asos es kol divrei Hatorah hazos” — And Moshe concluded his words and said, “now place them on your heart&#8230; that you should transmit them to your children.”</p>
<p>In defining the structure needed for effectively conveying our Mesorah to our children, Moshe did not merely say to heed his voice and follow his directions. Rather, he said to take the message to heart. Why?</p>
<p>Rashi explains that Moshe Rabbeinu was expressing a powerful message for Chinuch Habanim, educating our children. Tzarich adam sheyihiyu einav v’aznav v’libo michuvanim l’divrei Torah! Yes, to transmit our heritage one must have his eyes, ears and heart tuned in to the powerful lessons of Torah.</p>
<p>Lip service alone won’t do. A Torah lifestyle has to be seen as relevant in all aspects of our lives. Yiras Shamayim has to be heard as the natural sound of our daily Avodah. Indeed, our dveikus b’Hashem has to be so palpable that it can be felt, heart-to-heart in our home and on the job. Our children will then sense and absorb this multi-modal lesson and live it as well.</p>
<p>So how does one get there? Upon closer examination Rashi leaves us with an even more profound message. In commenting on the posuk and the need to “simu livavhchem” to engage your heart in avodas Hashem, Rashi presents a vital sequence. First he tells us sheyhyu einav—that your eyes must be focused on your relationship with Hashem and His Torah. Without training our outlook, refining our vision and conditioning our perspective to a Torah point of a view we will never get our heart into to it.</p>
<p>Our avoda starts with our eyes. With seeing ourselves and the Ribbono Shel Olam as relevant, personal meaningful and loving. We can then “hear” what he wants from us and we can feel with a full heart our deep closeness to Him and His closeness to us. After all, if we only knew how much Hashem Yisborach loved us, we would never do anything wrong.</p>
<p>Moshe Rabbeinu’s paradigm for Chinuch is as relevant today as it was the first time he spoke these words. When it comes to our yiddishkeit It is not enough to know. We must have heart. To get there we must develop our outlook. Indeed, it is vital for children to see and hear the living words of Torah in our lives.</p>
<p>In so doing we will be zoche to a g’mar chasimah tova, lanu ul’chol Yisrael.</p>

Every post I feel like writing is connected with parenting.</p>
<p>The last time this happened I was hooked on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/clothing/" target="_blank">clothes</a>. Those posts are all linked <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/24/mesillas-yesharim-052409/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/03/the-clothes-make-or-break-the-man-connections-2209/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/13/clothes-in-the-nba/" target="_blank">here</a>. I recommend checking those out.</p>
<p>One of the most popular articles on NYTimes.com this week is an Op-Ed about women&#8217;s happiness.</p>
<p>Cleverly titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/opinion/20dowd.html?_r=1&amp;em" target="_blank">Blue is the New Black</a>&#8220;, the article&#8217;s basic premise is that women having more opportunities and doing more does not contribute to their happiness.<span id="more-1235"></span></p>
<p>Some of the money quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Women around the world are in a funk&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Though women begin their lives more fulfilled than men, as they age, they gradually become less happy&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Choice is inherently stressful&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a bit of an issue with &#8220;Happiness Surveys&#8221; in general, especially across time and space. We all have different definitions of happiness and I find it hard to believe that there is a universal definition that can be compared across 40 years of women.</p>
<p>What disturbed me even more was this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Across the happiness data, the one thing in life that will make you less happy is having children. It’s true whether you’re wealthy or poor, if you have kids late or kids early. Yet I know very few people who would tell me they wish they hadn’t had kids or who would tell me they feel their kids were the destroyer of their happiness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Children are a lot of work. Children take up a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money. But I cannot fathom how people can have such a negative outlook on the effect of children on their lives.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that when one has no children they have more free time. Is free time the key ingredient to happiness in the minds of these people? What is it about children that can guarantee these people will be less happy?</p>
<p>Love is a great feeling. Loving one&#8217;s children must add good feelings to one&#8217;s life. More good feelings should help one feel more happiness. I find it shocking that these parents claim not to find more happiness in their lives.</p>
<p>Further, is happiness something that depends on external factors at all?</p>
<p>To me, happiness is a state of mind that exists irrespective of outside stimuli.</p>
<p>Even if someone is oppressed they can be happy. Even during trying times like tragedy or even Holocaust one can be happy.</p>
<p>Did women&#8217;s roles change in response to <strong>happiness</strong>? I think they changed in deference to <strong>fairness</strong>. In which case the entire article is meaningless. The happiness of women or anyone else was never the issue.</p>
<p>Ms. Dowd makes the issue &#8220;happiness&#8221; and then says &#8220;it didn&#8217;t work&#8221;. Color me confused. Blue or black&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1187" title="Kim Clijsters" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Kim-Clijsters-carries-dau-0021-300x221.jpg" alt="Kim Clijsters" width="300" height="221" />Something has been on mind the last few days. The last three blog posts I have attempted to write have been all on the same topic. I have decided to turn them into two blog posts and this is the first of a two part series.</p>
<p>The topic is parenting. The relationship between parents and their children.</p>
<p>It is a timely subject as the Jewish Calendar turns the page into a new year. A major element of the Rosh Hashana liturgy is the relationship between us and God. That relationship takes a few forms. One form is that of a parent to a child.</p>
<p><span id="more-1183"></span></p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen09/news/story?id=4471433" target="_blank">Kim Clijsters won the US Open</a>. The US Open is a Tennis Tournament featuring the greatest players in the world. Clijsters was a dominant tennis player a few years ago and then she took a break to have a baby. She had the baby and two and a half years later came back to competitive tennis. Her first major tournament in her comeback was the US Open. And she won.</p>
<p>What struck me is the media&#8217;s attention to the fact that she was a mother and yet somehow was able beat the odds and win the US Open. I think that is noteworthy because parents have different priorities than non-parents. Parents put their kids first and their lives second. That Clijsters could be a mother whose primary concern was her child and still had enough in the tank to train and compete and win is very impressive.</p>
<p>Clijsters demonstrated the true strength of being a woman. She demonstrated the ability to have her cake and eat it too. Clijsters is at the top of her professional world and is also a relatively new mother. Congratulations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I just can&#8217;t help but wonder how all this affects her child.</p>
<p>Is there a cost? Does her child miss her mother when she spends long hours training? Should a mother of a young child be spending more time with her child?</p>
<p>I think it is great that women have opportunities for success. I really do.</p>
<p>But what about the child? What if the father is also working a tough, time consuming job?</p>
<p>Who raises the children?</p>
<p>I know that this question is broader than Kim Clijsters winning the US Open. But the media attention surroounding her success and motherhood got me thinking.</p>
<p>What is the feminist approach to this issue? How are parenting duties divided when both parents work? Does it even matter? Or are children just as well off being raised by paid surrogates?</p>

An article on Ynet.com featured on VIN caught my ire this afternoon.

<div><span style="color:#336666;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/guest-pos-t-by-e.html" target="_blank"><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear &#8211; more discussion there.</em></a></strong></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/35376/2009/07/21/jerusalem-religious-large-families-are-joy-ignore-the-evil-feminist-anti-motherhood-terror/">An article on Ynet.com featured on VIN caught my ire this afternoon.</a></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">The writer, a woman, calls upon all Orthodox Jews to reject &#8220;the evil feminists&#8221; of Kolech and &#8220;have as many children as possible, as soon as possible&#8221;. For there is no greater joy in life than having many children.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Her arguments are weak (read it for yourself) and the ending says it all: &#8220;Trust me&#8221;. Why should I trust her?</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">As a proud father of 2 beautiful boys (a 6 year old and 8 month old) I can attest to the joys of parenthood. Giving the gift of life to one&#8217;s offspring is both very powerful and oftentimes emotional. I cannot imagine my life without my family.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">I must take issue with this woman&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;the greatest gift we can give our families is a big family. Very big&#8221;.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><span id="more-888"></span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">In the VIN comments, there is a quote from R&#8217; Shlomo Zalman Aurbach. When approached with a shaila regarding a woman who had 6 children and suffered a nervous breakdown for a heter to use birth control. His response, &#8220;why are you asking me, ask the Rav who gave her a heter to have 6 children in the first place!?&#8221;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Reb Moshe Feinstein writes in his Tshuvos that if the mother would suffer any physical, psychological or emotional harm from bearing more children she must use birth control.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><span style="font-style:italic;"></p>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Having a large family is not rooted in halacha. It is rooted in a social pressure to conform.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<p></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">What has happened is the children of the &#8220;survivors&#8221; and that generation had a social calling to have large families. They were able to bear it (for the most part) with a low cost of living and 9-5 jobs, leaving time and money to spare. Enough to support many of those children in Kollel.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">For many people pregnancy and childbirth as well as child rearing are difficult. For many families the cost of living is too high to support a large family. Work hours are long and the money does not go as far as it used to go.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Today&#8217;s society requires different approaches to life&#8217;s challenges from previous generations. The cost of living is higher. This forces most families to need a dual income. Who is going to raise these large families? What about the marriages? Husbands and wives who work full time, come home tired with children who need their time and attention. The idea of marriage in Judaism is to develop a relationship with a significant other. This cannot be ignored either!</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Our schools are suffering from unprecedented deficits and budget cutting. Parents are having a hard time paying the tuition bills. Large families may be all of &#8220;your joy&#8221; but they can be an unfair burden on the tzibbur.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">I am not calling for a &#8220;child cap&#8221; ala China. I am saying use your sechel and please don&#8217;t tell me what is good for you is good for everyone. Please don&#8217;t preach to me about what you think is right when it is not based on halacha.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Bitachon does not allow for recklessness. We cannot overburden ourselves or the system and expect bitachon to bail us out. There are children of large families who I know resented the lack of attention they received, the handouts they needed and the hustle and bustle of their busy homes. Those parents were likely ill equipped to deal with the large family dynamics and their children felt it.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Also, I happen to think that there are folks who have lots of kids to distract themselves from their unhappy lives, or their unhappy marriages (yes like a drug). Those folks need help. Not bigger families.</span></div>
