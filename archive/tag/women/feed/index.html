				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the more interesting ways to frame the question of Orthodox Jewish women wearing tefillin is in the context of yesterday&#8217;s post. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/02/24/life-is-in-its-struggles-dealing-with-the-tough-questions/">Life is in its Struggles: Dealing With the Tough Questions</a>)</p>
<p>Many of the statements made about women in the Talmud that sound offensive to us relate to women studying Torah. The objections to women learning Torah are mostly an issue of cognition or intellectual prowess. Regardless, the accepted unequivocal conclusion of the Talmud is that women should not study Torah.<span id="more-8160"></span></p>
<p>The parameters of this prohibition are not as broad as the Talmud seems to imply. The most restrictive opinions in the achronim say they may only learn the laws that are relevant to their practice. The Rambam says they are only prohibited from studying the Oral Law but he seems to hinge it upon their overall academic abilities which are fluid and subjective. The Chida famously said that if a woman wants to learn she can learn whatever she wants.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/two-tracks-converging.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8161" alt="two-tracks-converging" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/two-tracks-converging.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The point is that the very harsh statements of the Talmud regarding teaching women Torah has been narrowly tailored even according to the least permissive opinion. No one reads the halachic part of this rabbinic ban on Torah study for women without some form liberal interpretation.</p>
<p>When we contrast this with the statements of the Talmud regarding women wearing tefillin we see the opposite process. The Mishna simply says that women are exempt from tefillin. The Talmud never says explicitly that women should not wear tefillin. The Sefer HaChinuch discusses whether women would make the blessing on tefillin without saying that it is prohibited. We don&#8217;t know if women actually did wear tefillin but from a Talmudic perspective, they would have been allowed to wear tefillin.</p>
<p>Instead, the Rama is the one who makes the liberal statement of the Talmud more restrictive than it&#8217;s simple reading. The Rama says that women are exempt from tefillin but they should be strongly discouraged from wearing them. As an aside, I think it is reasonable that the Rama&#8217;s citation that <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.88" target="_blank">women should not touch Torah scrolls</a> is relevant and might have influenced his tefillin position. Something to think about.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2014 and it&#8217;s not just that they should be discouraged, it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s prohibited altogether. It&#8217;s even been said that women wearing tefillin today is a form of sectarianism. This is so far from the position stated in the Mishnah that it has to make us wonder how this happened.</p>
<p>I think it is worth noticing that these two trains are going in opposite directions on two different sets of tracks. I can&#8217;t explain or account for these very different story lines with any degree of certainty but I do have a guess. It could be that in the view of the poskim along the way, the leniencies regarding studying Torah are a &#8220;necessary evil&#8221; but are not ideal at all. It was just impossible to tell girls that they cannot study Torah in modern society. Plus there is the Chida. There is no such necessity for tefillin and there is no Chida (although there is the Chinuch and Michal bas Shaul).</p>
<p>That does not account for the increasingly stringent views on tefillin. That might just be the same as any other increasingly stringent halachic development. The combination of necessary and precedent might explain the reason for increasingly liberal positions on Torah study for women. It might also provide the blueprint for adjustments to our views on women wearing tefillin and other similar issues. Time will tell.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the works of Chazal, the Geonim, the Rishonim, and the Achronim, we encounter giants of Torah knowledge, spirit masters of the soul, and gladiators of moral struggle. Perhaps this is why it strikes us as so odd that some of the statements of these greats seem so offensive to us. In particular, there are quite a few statements about women that defy our modern understanding of biology and female potential.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are many positive comments in the Talmud and beyond about women. However, when it comes to a woman&#8217;s cognitive abilities, several rabbis in the Talmud take an arcane approach. Famously, it is said that women have a thin capacity for &#8220;daat&#8221; and that anyone who teaches women Torah is teaching licentiousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10102167463562475?stream_ref=10" target="_blank">Another possible example</a> is sourced in last week&#8217;s parsha. Rabbi Eliezer is quoted as saying that &#8220;women have only one area of wisdom, the spindle.&#8221; The Jerusalem Talmud compounds this statement by including his subsequent comment to his son that &#8220;it&#8217;s better for Torah to burn than to teach Torah to a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to reinterpret the offensive statements through a variety of methods.<span id="more-8151"></span> Not every statement can be reinterpreted, but I think a reinterpretation has been offered for every one of these statements. We are extremely uncomfortable with taking these statements literally. This is for two separate reasons. First, we don&#8217;t want to be restricted by the consequences of these statements. We want to teach Torah to our daughters. If we take these statements literally, teaching our daughters Torah is forbidden. Second, we simply don&#8217;t agree with the literal interpretations of these statements. We know that women are actually as smart as men. We know that women can do a lot of things that these statements seem to imply they are incapable of doing. So we reinterpret the statements in order that our modern understanding of women is not at odds with the rabbinic understanding of women in Late Antiquity through the Age of Enlightenment.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/struggle-with-life.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8155" alt="struggle-with-life" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/struggle-with-life.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>These offensive statements do not bother me at all. Not even a tiny bit. It&#8217;s not because I agree with the statements. It&#8217;s also not because I think the statements were really hidden messages of praise toward women.</p>
<p>The reason these statements do not bother me at all is because when these statements were stated, no one thought they were offensive. It is only in the last 100 years that we have come to accept, in most parts of the world, that these ideas are incorrect. Just 101 years ago, Sir Almroth E. Wright MD <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5183/pg5183.txt" target="_blank">wrote the following</a> argument against women&#8217;s suffrage:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;[&#8230;]the woman suffragist takes it as a matter of course that she would herself be able to construct a system of workable laws. In point of fact, the framing of a really useful law is a question of divining something which will apply to an infinite number of different cases and individuals. It is an intellectual feat on a par with the framing of a great generalisation. And would woman&#8211;that being of such short sight, whose mind is always so taken up with whatever instances lie nearest to her&#8211;be capable of framing anything that could pass muster as a great generalization?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Should it surprise us that rabbis living 2000 years ago agreed with this idea? Of course not. Galen said 2200 years ago that &#8220;in all respects,&#8221; less perfect than man. This was authoritative science in the era of Chazal. It was their reality.</p>
<p>I think the offensive statements are in fact offensive. I think they were meant the way they were recorded. I think they reflect the way men thought about women until very recently. Yet, none of this bothers me because I am comfortable holding Chazal to the standard of their milieu. They lived in a world where this was commonly held belief and so there is no crime in their acquiescence to these beliefs.</p>
<p>Further, awareness of the historical context makes reinterpretation even more difficult to accept. In order to suggest a liberal or progressive interpretation of a statement that is offensive in its simplest reading, the following assumptions are required. A) We must say that the author of the statement meant to say something positive about women. B) The author chose to make this positive statement using language that on its face sounds offensive. C) The simplest interpretation of the statement is that it was offensive. D) Everyone at the time the statement was made would have read it as offensive and agreed with the statement. E) Then one day, we starting being nicer to women and we realized that the original statement that sounded so offensive really had a hidden meaning that was positive all along. F) Further, all the great Torah scholars who read the statement literally for the last 2000 years and built religious laws and practices based on this literal interpretation mistakenly believed the statement was literal but it was really some sort of metaphor or idiom that we only figured out very recently. (You see, how in order to make one rabbi look better, we make hundreds look worse, but I digress.) This logical structure seems quite farfetched and I see no reason or benefit to invoking it in these situations.</p>
<p>Instead, let&#8217;s own it. Yes. Our rabbis understood women differently than we do today. That&#8217;s okay. They understood all social and scientific conditions as they were in their day and so do we. It&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>This all leads to a more pressing question that I was asked in several different ways and by several different people during two separate discussions of these ideas over the weekend.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why talk about this? Isn&#8217;t there better stuff to discuss? Isn&#8217;t there a risk that people will see this stuff and it will cause them to be turned off from Judaism? Don&#8217;t we prefer that these things be broached in a safe, quiet place and not in public?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This is a valid question. I have two things to say about this issue and this is the real reason I am writing this article. Both are really two sides of the same coin. (Of course there are other reasons to discuss these issues as well.)</p>
<p><strong>Life is in its struggles</strong>. If we are not struggling, we are not growing. If we are not growing, we are dying. People think that it&#8217;s best to avoid struggles. They says we can build ourselves up by focusing on the things that provide no resistance. They claim that life is happier when we are comfortable. I strongly disagree. Life does not happen where things are easy. Life is in its struggles.</p>
<p>There is great value in engaging in struggles. That is how we grow. When I see something that makes me struggle or that might cause others to struggle, I see an opportunity. It&#8217;s a chance to get into the trenches and do some work. We will grow from the struggle. This is true even if we don&#8217;t come to a happy resolution. The act of struggle is in itself a form of growth.</p>
<p>When we see a selection in the Talmud that pushes our buttons, we should not push aside our question and go to our happy place. We should seize the opportunity to grapple with our question. It&#8217;s a gift and we should treasure it accordingly.</p>
<p>Which leads to the second point. I have found that the overwhelming complaint of people who leave Orthodox Judaism (or even those who are disenchanted but stay) is that legitimate questions were dismissed or ignored. Note, their complaint is not that their legitimate questions were unanswered. Their complaint is that the questions were not acknowledged.</p>
<p>Our knee jerk response to tough questions is to go to our place of safety where there are no questions. Call it the Abie Rotenberg Zone. I love Abie and his music, but to me his songs with English lyrics are mostly representative of a place where things are simple. The struggles are superficial. Answers are readily available and sometimes to simplistic. To the genuine asker of the question it can seem dismissive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more important to acknowledge that the question is indeed a tough nut to crack than it is to wave a hand and give a dismissive &#8220;answer&#8221;. It is better to enter into the fray and struggle even without a resolution than it is to ignore the struggle. When we acknowledge the struggle we are saying &#8220;you are not alone.&#8221; &#8220;We are struggling together with you.&#8221; The feeling of knowing that we not alone and that we can engage in this struggle together is so empowering. It can literally be life saving.</p>
<p>So when I see something that I have struggled with at some point, or that someone else has told me they struggled with at a certain point, or that I am struggling with right now, I think it is much better to address it than to ignore it. I prefer to engage in that struggle or at least provide a place for others to engage in that struggle. That is so much more valuable than the alternatives. Not only is not destructive, it is empowering.</p>
<p>I think the Orthodox Jewish community needs to work on this particular idea. We have an aversion to conflict and we have a fear of engaging in the struggle. I think we need to embrace the challenges we encounter in our Jewish journey. We will grow from the ensuing struggle and by acknowledging the struggle we will validate its place in our discourse providing ourselves and others the comfort in knowing that we are struggling together. And together we will persevere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last few days I have seen many arguments and positions in favor of rigid, traditional gender roles. This is in response to an infinitesimal number of Orthodox (or somewhat Orthodox) Jewish women who are interested in laying tefillin or performing other rituals and roles traditionally reserved for men.</p>
<p>Gender roles arguments arise in two different contexts that can be hard to splice. Some gender roles are social and some are religious.<span id="more-8083"></span></p>
<p>Social gender roles are the things that men and women do in non-religious contexts. Who is the breadwinner? Who cares for the children? Who pays the bills? Who cooks dinner? Who drives when husband and wife are in the car? Who decorates the home? Some people think that the man is the breadwinner, who pays the bill the bills, and drives the car. While the woman cares for the children, cooks dinner, and decorates the home.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mmKVlOc.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mmKVlOc.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="mmKVlOc" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8084" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>These questions are somewhat related to the issues raised by traditional gender stereotypes. Supposedly, boys like sports, war, and blue. Girls like dolls, art, and pink. Men are loud and confident. Women are soft spoken and meek. A real man is manly. A real woman is feminine. Some people think these bright lines are very important and they should not be crossed.</p>
<p>These are all social issues. A growing number of people, especially among Millennials think that these roles and stereotypes ought to be tossed out the window. Couples should divide their responsibilities based on preference and ability, not chromosomes. Boys can play with dolls. Men can embrace their feminine side. Girls can play sports. Women can be more assertive. More and more people in Western countries think this way.</p>
<p>Socially, women have greatly benefited from these progressive attitudes. It has given women the right to own land, attend school, vote, join government, achieve corporate success, and live fulfilling lives independent of their roles as mothers and wives. Just look at misyognistic advertisements and how-to guides from the first half of the 20th century. When men were men! It&#8217;s cringeworthy. This makes it hard to see how one can object to these social advances.</p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism in America skews to the more &#8220;traditional&#8221; values side of women’s roles. (Traditional is really a misnomer. At certain times in history and in many places, men have had more passive roles and women have had more assertive roles. Also, marriages were different. Some men had several wives while in other places there was no such thing as marriage. And men used to boss their wives around like servants. So when we say “traditional” it’s really just a word used to appeal to emotion but is entirely inaccurate.) Generally, Orthodox Judaism teaches that it is virtuous to raise a family, and be a good wife, and be a good hostess, and cook good food, and to accentuate femininity. Men are the leaders of the home and the community, spending their day either studying Torah or earning a living and participating in communal religious practice.</p>
<p>However, things have changed significantly within Orthodox Judaism as well. A 19th century Orthodox Jewish woman would feel quite liberated in 21st century Orthodox Judaism (save for the most insular communities). Women are more educated, more women work outside the home, women are more involved in communal life, and women are taking more positions of authority institutionally. This is happening at varying speeds and degrees depending almost entirely on the insularity of the sub-sect.</p>
<p>There are some gender roles that are religiously mandated by Jewish law. By religious, we mean that these things are codified in books of Jewish law as details related to the practice of Mitzvos from the Torah and Chazal. Men have obligations that women do not. Men are required to provide for their families. Only men can be the monarch, or perform duties in the Temple, or be the Messiah, or divorce their spouse.</p>
<p>So religiously, there are clear distinctions between men and women in Judaism. Socially, the trend is toward looser gender roles even within the Orthodox Jewish community. Religious matters are pretty much incontrovertible. Social matters are not only less rigid, they are changing before our very eyes.</p>
<p>But there is a giant area of overlap between the two. There are things that are most likely a result of social conditions that have found their way into religious law or accepted practice. This is the area with all the action.</p>
<p>Women shaking arba minim, women counting the Omer, women’s prayer groups, women halachic advisors, women donning a tallis or tefillin, women dancing with the Torah on Simchas Torah, women reading from the Torah for other women, etc. These issues are matters that relate to religious practice but are not explicitly prohibited by the Torah or even by Chazal. Yet, over time standards and expectations have evolved into normative practice. Some have even been addressed explicitly by Gaonim, Rishonim, Achronim, and recent poskim.</p>
<p>This creates an area of great tension. Some people value the authority of the decisions by halachic codifiers and rabbis. If the Rema makes an authoritative statement then it is binding on Orthodox Jews because the Rema’s authority extends to these areas. If the Mishneh Brurah issues a psak, it becomes authoritative too.</p>
<p>Other people value the open-ended nature of halachic position of the early authorities like the Talmud. If the Talmud permits something, then it remains permissible. To them, the fact that things evolved later on can be attributed to culture and social mores and cannot prohibit that which was permitted by the Talmud.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this is the core of the recent debate about women wearing tefillin. But it’s really much more than that. These differing views really explain every single one of the issues in the area where religion and social gender roles overlap. In some examples, the traditionalists have yielded to the &#8220;whims&#8221; of modernity. In other examples, it seems impossible that things will change.</p>
<p>It must be noted, that it is entirely possible to be a staunch social gender roles progressive and be a religious gender roles traditionalist. However, in the grey area of overlap, it is inevitable that one will make subjective distinctions, no matter how reasonable they may be. I think it’s useless to invoke one’s position on social gender roles or purely religious gender roles in this discussion. They are almost irrelevant to the discussion about the area of overlap.</p>
<p>Finally, I don’t expect naturally conservative or traditionally minded people to just change their mind on feminism. But I do find the extreme aversion to the movement more than a bit disturbing. I have heard rabbis compare feminism to heretical movements. Orthodox Judaism is not inherently anti-feminist in a social sense. The Torah does not require men to work and women to stay in the home. Nor does the Torah require that boys play with tools and that girls play with My Little Pony. I see no reason that Orthodox Jews should see feminism as such a great threat. If anything, I believe anti-feminism poses a far greater threat to Orthodox Judaism. If we cannot somewhat synchronize Judaism with modern culture, we will be forced to retreat out of the modern world and create ghettos completely isolated from the rest of the world. That would not be ideal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wouldn&#8217;t quite call it a trend, but a growing number of women and girls in the Orthodox Jewish community are interested in wearing tefillin publicly. Two Modern Orthodox schools have made public statements that indicate they will allow, not encourage or discourage, their students to wear tefillin.</p>
<p>This has generated a lot of discussion, mostly negative, from within the Orthodox Jewish community. Some of the JewsNews sites have reported this bit of news in a very negative way. Some, to the very liberal side of Orthodox Judaism have embraced the decision.<span id="more-8076"></span></p>
<p>The halachic background is not overly complex. Technically, tefillin should fall into the same category as all other time bound mitzvos. Lulav, Shofar, Sukkah, and daily prayer are also time bound mitzvos and are voluntary for women. The conclusion in the Talmud exempts women from tefillin. Some rishonim explicitly permit tefillin for women. Some explicitly prohibit it. The Rema famously discourages it. That is, he does not prohibit it, he just advises against it. Some of the Achronim explain why it would be prohibited or advised against. <a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tefillin_barbie.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8077" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tefillin_barbie.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Some people are assuming their intentions are less than perfect. That&#8217;s complete conjecture and not something worth discussing. But I think the halachic arguments are important. I also think that working out whether it&#8217;s permitted or prohibited is vital. But I think it&#8217;s misplaced in the context of the current issue. The discussion right now should not be whether it&#8217;s good policy or against our best interests to allow women to wear tefillin.</p>
<p>Instead, the discussion should be whether we <em>tolerate</em> women who want to wear tefillin in Orthodox Judaism. In other words, even if I disagree with their decision, is this something worth the cost of declarations and opinions that cast these women and these institutions in a negative light?</p>
<p>We already disagree on plenty of things and we can get along just fine. Some eat kitniyos on Pesach, others do not. Some use the eruv, some do not. Some open soda cans on Shabbos, others do not. Some visit rebbes and ask for blessings, others do not. Some go to Uman, others do not. Some say Kabbalas Shabbos, others do not. Some do Yom Kippur Katan, others do not. Some do every segula, some do none. There are literally hundreds of things that already divide us in practice. Yet we are capable of carrying on as a group. I don&#8217;t see why a few women putting on tefillin should be such a drastic decision that it means more than eating in the Sukkah on Shmini Atzeres vs. not eating in the Sukkah on Shmini Atzeres.</p>
<p>In other words, what are the stakes here? And why are they being presented as so great? What is going to happen if a few women wear tefillin? What&#8217;s the dire consequence that we must avoid at all costs?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it. I think those who don&#8217;t want women to wear tefillin should just not wear tefillin or even teach their daughters that they don&#8217;t think they should wear tefillin. But I don&#8217;t see how doing a mitzvah can make someone unorthodox.</p>
<p>If an opponent of women wearing tefillin found out his daughter started wearing tefillin, would the daughter be disowned? I can&#8217;t imagine. So why are we disowning other daughters?</p>
<p>The opposition must identify something objectively wrong that will happen if we <em>tolerate </em>a few women wearing tefillin. Or even if we <em>tolerate </em>many women wearing tefillin. Until they&#8217;ve done so, I don&#8217;t think we can allow this difference to divide us. We&#8217;ve been able to avoid completely breaking apart over a million other things. I don&#8217;t accept that this particular issue is so vital that it must break us up now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gavel31.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7106" alt="gavel31" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gavel31.jpg?resize=300%2C247" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I am not permitted to disclose particular details, but I was privy to the court transcript of the end of the trial and court decision in the custody battle from <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/05/20/another-ex-hasid-loses-custody-of-her-children/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post.</a> My general thoughts have not changed. In general, I think that many women are scared that if they leave the ultra-orthodox community they will be forced to forgo custody of their children. This is a legitimate fear. That was my point yesterday.</p>
<p>Today, I will address this case and I will attempt to be brief.</p>
<p>The case is complex and there is no simple solution. Both of the parents are flawed human beings, just like the rest of us. Both parents have some merit to their case. The judge seemed to skew toward the father whenever it was a judgment call and away from the mother when it was a judgment call. The primary issue in the case, as always, is what is the best interest of the child.</p>
<p>One aspect of that was where the children would have less &#8220;confusion&#8221;. With very little support and with a dismissive wave of the hand to the mother&#8217;s expert, the judge ruled that having the children live a new secular life with their mother would be more harmful than continuing the same life with their father.</p>
<p>I think this was the weakest part of the case.<span id="more-7105"></span></p>
<p>The children will still be seeing their mother on a fairly regular basis. Although she is required to adhere to the rules of the children&#8217;s&#8217; school, they will know she is not chasidic like their father is. So it&#8217;s still confusing. I don&#8217;t see how this solves anything.</p>
<p>In other words, the court established as a fact that there would be confusion is she were awarded custody &#8211; this was speculative and rebuttal evidence was not really considered, then the court established that to minimize confusion the father should be awarded custody &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t seem to solve the problem. This was the extent to which religious values and practices were applied in the case. It was purely with regard to &#8220;confusion&#8221;.</p>
<p>In terms of this case, I think the evidence to support custody on either side was weak. Neither side made a great case. The &#8220;confusion&#8221; section of the decision was particularly speculative (which is ironic considering how the judge dismissed some evidence in favor of the mother because it was too speculative). In the trial transcript the judge clearly said that the mother has the right to choose to leave orthodox Judaism, however she cannot make that choice for her children. I found that troubling. I wonder how old or how young a child must be for a parent to have the right to take their child out of orthodox Judaism? Maybe never?</p>
<p>In terms of the general issues this case raises, I think there are some legitimate concerns. First, like I said above, I think that losing child custody is a fear that many women have when they consider leaving orthodox Judaism. I am not sure this is the best tactic for keeping people in the fold nor do I think it is a positive message from the Frum community. But I think this case opens the door to fighting this presumption. The court relied heavily on the &#8220;confusion&#8221; for the children if their mother was no longer ultra-orthodox. This can be rebutted. It might take some time, it might take some better experts, but by no means is this a <em>fait accompli. </em>Further, the court seemed to have been much more amenable to joint custody solutions if the mother would have committed to even the slightest observance. There is room in the most liberal sects of modern orthodoxy for very relaxed observance. It seems that this would have been enough to allay fears of confusion. This just goes to show how little sense the &#8220;confusion&#8221; issue makes.</p>
<p>In sum, the case was decided on several issues. It was a harsh decision that I don&#8217;t think solves the issues it purports to solve. It was not a purely religious decision. It seems that this case need not be a case that will impact future cases of women in similar situations if the chips fall just a little bit differently.</p>
<p>I empathize with the mother in this case, but I do not feel that the sole issue in the case was religious observance. It may have played to prominent a role, but I have a feeling she may have lost custody even if &#8220;confusion&#8221; was not at issue here. In the end, it is extremely painful to read, let alone experience, a judge deciding the fate of a family. I can only imagine what kind of pain the entire family is experiencing. In particular, the mother, who lost custody must be completely beside herself. I wish her much strength in putting the pieces back together and finding happiness and success in the next phase of her life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6521" title="JudahEmblem" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png?resize=150%2C214" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In what has become a familiar refrain, the Torah Temimah in Parshas Vayetze takes the most expansive position available with regard to women prophetesses.</p>
<p>In Vayetze, Leah and Yaakov have a bunch of children who eventually become half of the tribes of Israel. In naming her fourth son, Leah decides to thank God &#8220;this time&#8221;. The commentaries wonder why Leah is thanking God &#8220;this time&#8221;. Rashi explains that she was giving thanks for taking &#8220;more than her portion&#8221;. The idea is that there were four women who were the mothers of the tribes to be and there were to be 12 tribes. If each mother got her equal share they would each bear three sons. Leah was now on her fourth so she realized she was getting &#8220;more than she thought she was getting&#8221;. For this she thanked God.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah tells us that Rashi is quoting a Midrash Raba and that Leah knew this information because she saw it with <em>ruach hakodesh. </em>He then quotes a Maharsha that says that this cannot be a prophecy because Leah is not included in the list of twelve prophetesses in the first chapter of (Babylonian Talmud) Megillah 14A. Rather she made this proclamation with no intent and God placed it in her lips to speak of the future. The Torah Temimah remarks that this is very hard pill to swallow.<span id="more-6520"></span></p>
<p>So instead, the Torah Temimah says, and there is no need to quote him here so I will paraphrase, that all the matriarchs were prophetesses. He uses a Midrash Socher Tov to support this assertion as that Midrash makes a drasha to make the same point. He goes on to say that there are competing opinions among the rabbinic commentators and there are sources on each side of the debate. Therefore, one cannot ask from one source to the other.</p>
<p>Nothing too groundbreaking here, but the overall point is that once again the Torah Temimah is trying his best to include women as potential prophetesses. And for that we thank him.</p>
<p>Also, I think it is clear from the Maharsha and the Torah Temimah that <em>ruach hakodesh </em>would be considered prophecy. I am pretty sure this is the opinion of Maimonides. What&#8217;s interesting, is that it seems that one cannot posses <em>ruach hakodesh </em> unless one is a candidate for prophecy. Are there any opinions who claim authentic prophecy is possible today? Can we authoritatively rule out<em> ruach hakodesh</em> as well? At least according to this Maharsha? I think so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ushpizin61.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6493" title="7prohetesses" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ushpizin61.jpg?resize=283%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>You&#8217;ll recall that last week I wrote about the Torah Temimah&#8217;s opinion of R&#8217; Meir as it relates to women. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/11/12/an-interesting-torah-temimah-on-nashim-datan-kalot/">An Interesting Torah Temimah on Nashim Datan Kalot</a>) This week I discovered another interesting comment from the Torah Temimah that I think is also significant but not as significant.</p>
<p>Parshas Toldos begins with a confused Rivkah wondering why she was experiencing a very strange pregnancy. The passuk says וַתֵּלֶךְ, לִדְרֹשׁ אֶת-יְהוָה. Rivkah went to inquire with God. The verse does not say how exactly she made this inquiry.</p>
<p>The commentaries offer two main options. 1) She inquired with a prophet. 2) She prayed to God (Ramban).</p>
<p>The Torah continues and tells us: ,&#8230;וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה לָהּ &#8211; God said to her&#8230; Here the commentaries say that she was answered via prophecy. It could be that the Ramban would say that she was answered directly, but he does not comment on these words.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah mentions some speculation that the reason that God did not speak to her directly was because as a general rule God does not speak to women (save for Sarah) as per the Jerusalem Talmud in Sota (7:1) (apologies to Michelle Bachmann). However, the Torah Temimah directs us to his commentary in Parshas Vayera where the Torah tells us that God spoke directly to Sarah. Here he quotes the Jerusalem Talmud and then expands on it in his commentary.<span id="more-6490"></span></p>
<p>Here is what he says  (translation my own, parentheticals are my additions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This exegesis requires explanation in general, because we have seen several women who were prophetesses, as the (Babylonian) Talmud counts on 14A, Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Chana, Avigayil, Chuldah, Esther, and is so how is it that the Jerusalem Talmud says that we do not find God talking with women, since these women were prophetesses he must have spoke to them!?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And me must say that God&#8217;s talking with the prophetesses must have been with regard to public matters, whereas with regard to private matters God only spoke directly with Sarah. And that which it says when God spoke to Eve and Rebecca it must have been with a go-between as we explained there.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Also we can answer this question according to that which is written in the Guide (for the Perplexed by Maimonides) chapter 45, where he counts 11 levels of prophecy, and the level of prophecy for women is until the seventh level, look there, and according to this it can be said that the intent here (Jerusalem Talmud) is that Sarah reached the level of prophecy that is the pinnacle of prophecy, and that is the level of prophecy of (King) Solomon, and this is not the place to expound further.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a huge thing, but I see this as the Torah Temimah trying to &#8220;soften the blow&#8221;. The Jerusalem Talmud takes a very harsh stance towards women and their spiritual capabilities and the Torah Temimah doesn&#8217;t think that this is a great message. In classic rabbinic form he reinterprets the statement from the Jerusalem Talmud to make it much more palatable. It&#8217;s not women&#8217;s liberation propaganda. It&#8217;s not going to be in JOFA&#8217;s literature. But it is something. It might be an acknowledgement from a great Torah scholar that taken at face value, this is an offensive statement towards women.</p>
<p>I think that most women would feel more comfortable serving God that does talk to women than a God who does not talk to women. It could be that the Torah Temimah was trying to ensure that women not be led to believe that the simple reading of the Jerusalem Talmud is the only authority on the matter.</p>
<p>Then again, it might just be a commentator trying to reconcile contradictory statements. But I think that every exegete chooses their battles. The fact that the Torah Temimah chose this battle shows me something.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Baruch_Epstein.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6455" title="Baruch_Epstein" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Baruch_Epstein.jpg?resize=203%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em>(I&#8217;ve been told that the proper pronunciation of Datan is with two syllables, not three. HT: Steg)</em></p>
<p>Perusing the Torah Temimah this Shabbos I noticed something that is noteworthy for one reason, and possibly very noteworthy for another. I admit that the second part of this post is speculation, but I welcome your thoughts on my thoughts.</p>
<p>The Passuk in Chayei Sarah declares that &#8220;God blessed Avraham Ba&#8217;kol.&#8221; Literally this means that God blessed Avraham with everything. The Talmud in Bava Basra (16B) relates a five-way dispute amongst the rabbis as to specifically what &#8220;Ba&#8217;Kol&#8221; means. We only need to look at the first three.</p>
<p><em>R&#8217; Meir says that Avraham was blessed by not having a daughter. R&#8217; Yehuda says that he was blessed with a daughter. The Acheirim say that he was blessed with a daughter named &#8220;Bakol&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>The Torah Temimah explains (translation my own, parentheticals are my additions):<span id="more-6452"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The opinion of R&#8217; Meir is consistent with other information we have about R&#8217; Meir as R&#8217; Meir was the one who established the blessing of &#8220;shelo asani isha&#8221; as is explained in Menachos 43B. This is because the measure of women was light in </em>his <em>eyes, because the thinness of their mind, as it says in Avodah Zara 18B that R&#8217; Meir fled from the Land of Israel to Babylonia due to his shame as a result of his wife Bruria. (</em>According to Rashi in Avoda Zara, R&#8217; Meir was challenged by his wife Bruria regarding his assertion that women had inferior minds to men. R&#8217; Meir wanted to show that the principle was correct and so he responded by having one of his students seduce Bruria. She resisted for a while but eventually she relented. When she came to her senses, she was so upset that she hanged herself. When R&#8217; Meir discovered her, he fled to Babylonia.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Additionally, because he sinned with that one woman as it is described in Seder Hadoros</em> (I am not familiar with this reference), <em>and for this reason, the text in Menachos</em> (that teaches us to make the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em>) <em>is R&#8217; Meir and not R&#8217; Yehuda</em> (apparently, the text of this Talmudic passage was in dispute).</p>
<p>What is the Torah Temimah saying?</p>
<p>First of all, many different apologetics have been used to explain the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em>. The gist of all of them is the women are either equal or superior to men and the blessing is not indicative of a negative feeling toward women in the Talmud. The Torah Temimah is saying that no amount of apologetics can explain R&#8217; Meir&#8217;s opinion and halachic rulings about women. He did have an issue with women. It was part of who he was.</p>
<p>Thus, it seems a bit disingenuous to say that R&#8217; Meir really thought women were superior to men and that the blessing is not meant to establish women as inferior to men. The Torah Temimah is connecting his halachic rulings with his life experiences. He interpreted Avraham&#8217;s blessing of &#8220;ba&#8217;kol&#8221; as <em>not having a daughter</em><em>! </em>So while I think it is fair to say that the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> and the dictum of <em>nashim datan kalot</em> are not as nefarious as some people may feel (as I have written previously: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/01/11/apropos-of-nothing-well-maybe-something-rabbi-julie-schonfeld-edition/">Apropos of Nothing (well… maybe something): Rabbi Julie Schonfeld Edition</a>), I also think it is fair to be honest, and the Torah Temimah is telling us that R&#8217; Meir in particular had a feeling about women that was negative.</p>
<p>I think that is unquestionably a fair inference from the Torah Temimah.</p>
<p>I now present a bit of speculation.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Torah Temimah was trying to distinguish R&#8217; Meir&#8217;s opinion from the other rabbis. It is possible that part of the point over here is that it was R&#8217; Meir <em>and only R&#8217; Meir</em> that had these opinions about women and it came from a confluence of events and issues that arose in his life. In other words, not all rabbis agree with R&#8217; Meir that <em>nashim datan kalot. </em>It was his opinion but not everyone agreed.</p>
<p>I admit that there are a plethora of other examples in the Talmud that portray women less than admirably. But as far as the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> and the principle of<em> nashim datan kalot</em>, they may not have been as universally held as some believe. I think the Torah Temimah is trying to do this, at least obliquely. But as I said, it is speculation. Certainly, it is interesting food for thought.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

It has been the home of the Masters Tournament for about 8o years and it has been a club that excluded women from membership. Women were permitted to play the course but were denied membership.</p>
<p>Pressure to enter women into membership has been ongoing for about 10 years. The club finally relented this week and has admitted two women as members. The two women are Condoleeza Rice and Darla Moore.</p>
<p>This is a major breakthrough. The club is a private club and private institutions have much more leeway in restricting membership than public institutions. Public institutions are subject to the will of the government and legislation. That means that the laws could be &#8220;ahead&#8221; of the public. Sometimes the government establishes a standard that is fair or just but not necessarily the will of the public. However, when a private club changes its policies it is a much more profound statement about the will of the people. A private institution is much more likely to wait until the public demand fairness or justice before it acts. Private institutions rarely establish standards that are &#8220;ahead&#8221; of their time. They are much more likely to establish standards that reflect the public&#8217;s consciousness.<span id="more-6159"></span></p>
<p>Augusta is finally doing what the government did many decades ago. They are treating women just like men with respect to admittance into their private club.</p>
<p>There are two ways to look at this. One is to say that the &#8220;free market&#8221; got it right. A private institution not subject to government regulation figured out that the marketplace wants a club that admits men and women.</p>
<p>The other way to look at this is to say, yes, the free market got it right, but it took way too long! If you wait around for the free market an injustice can perpetuate for years or even decades until the marketplace demands it. The marketplace does not <em>set</em> morality. It merely reflects public opinion. It was wrong for a club to discriminate &#8211; even if the market does not demand it. Waiting for the free market to figure out what is right and what is wrong is not an efficient way of establishing social change. It might get the job done eventually, but sometimes society needs a kick in the pants from authority.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t think that barring women from membership is wrong, just look at Augusta&#8217;s previous policy of not allowing blacks as members until 1990. It took until 1990 for the free market to demand equality based on skin color. <em>1990</em>!</p>
<p>The point is that while the free market might be a great way of running an economic system, I have no comment on that issue at this time, it is a poor way of determining fairness and justice. Case in point: Augusta National.</p>
<p>In closing, Augusta National is a real place and this is a real story. But if it weren&#8217;t, this entire post could be a metaphor for orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TALMUD-popup.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6104" title="TALMUD-popup" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TALMUD-popup.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I like the NY Times. The quality of content and the breadth of its coverage is outstanding. I am a subscriber and I enjoy reading as much as I can read of the Times in print and online. I feel comfortable with the Times in my home because they avoid the salacious tabloid stories you find in the other papers and report the important and interesting stories. (We get the Wall Street Journal as well for many of the same reasons.)</p>
<p>It is rare to see them blow the coverage as badly as they have done with their story on the Siyum HaShas.</p>
<p>A story in the Metro Section spend approximately 10 words talking about the Siyum and about 1000 words talking about women in orthodox Judaism. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, women in orthodox Judaism is an important story. We talk it about it all the time around here. But it was not the story of the Siyum.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing one would expect from a tabloid. Talk about the small detail that gets people riled up to sell papers. But the NY Times is better than that.<br />
<span id="more-6102"></span></p>
<p>The Siyum was the biggest event in recent memory in New York. Almost 100,000 people in one place at one time. It&#8217;s not as if the Siyum could be written off as a blip on the radar. It was a major event. Traffic was the worst it has been in 25 years according to some traffic experts due in part to the Siyum. The traffic reports on the radio were talking about the event in greater detail and with greater reverence than the NY Times article. During traffic reports the story is the traffic, yet they still managed to slip in some information about the event. The NY Times story was about the Siyum and they nearly forgot to talk about the Siyum. There was plenty to report. The Times could have talked about the rabbis at the Siyum who came from Israel. They could have talked about the concept behind Daf Yomi. They could have talked about the actual event. But they did not.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t attribute this <em>faux pas</em> to anti-Semitism or disdain for traditional orthodox Judaism. I chalk it up to dismal reporting. That is what it was and for the NY Times to miss the point on such a huge event is rare and also disappointing.</p>
<p>As for the mechitza and the implications thereof. First of all, the mechitza was up for about 35 minutes of a 6 hour program. It was so insignificant in the grand scheme of things that to be talking about the mechitza is to completely miss the point. The women were not being &#8220;hidden&#8221;. Frum Jews simply pray with a mechitza at almost all times. That&#8217;s what they did here. The organizers of the event wanted people not to have to think about compromising in their standards of separated prayer. Still, people want to talk about it. So here you go.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone really thinks the mechitza was absolutely necessary. It was impossible for one to see across the stadium. The women were so far away from the men that I can&#8217;t imagine anyone would have a halachic problem davening without the mechitza. In the small area where men and women sat near one another I think a mechitza between the men and women would have been appropriate. The all encompassing mechitza was a bit more than necessary. But Frum Jews don&#8217;t like to pray without a mechitza and it is understandable that they would plan to use a mechitza during davening times. This is all normal behavior.</p>
<p>It did look a bit strange to the insider and to the outsider. But again, this is what most orthodox Jews expect at an event that has two minyanim. The fact that there was no mechitza for 5 and a half hours simply outweighs the fact that there was a mechitza for 35 minutes. I am not saying that this was &#8220;progress&#8221;. I am saying that this is normal in orthodox Judaism so you can&#8217;t make a big deal about something that is normal in orthodox Judaism simply because it took place in MetLife stadium.</p>
<p>Personally, I found the constant reminders at the Siyum about &#8220;kavod HaToyrah&#8221; and the extend they separated men and women a bit over the top. Nothing is going to happen if men and women walk into the stadium together.  To prove my point, there were no separate exits and men and women left the Siyum together, were walking together in the parking lot, and as far as I know, there were no incidents of offensive immoral behavior due to the commingling of men and women. Would the kedusha of the event have been compromised if we all used one entrance? Probably not. So I don&#8217;t love the idea of over-separated men and women. But I expect it, and it is not the story of the Siyum. Not one bit.</p>
<p>And for next time, if you want to sit with your wife, your daughter, your sister, or the other women in your life, pony up for a suite. Those are unregulated seating sections. Start saving your pennies now.</p>

That article discussed the various positions and authorities in Jewish Law regarding ascending the Temple Mount. Their next project was an article on contraception in orthodox Judaism. This article has not yet been published. It is being made available on this blog to benefit the public.</em></p>
<p>A little while back (I can&#8217;t remember when) I mentioned that would be writing a blog post about this subject. I had intended to do a little summary of this article and add my own two cents. Now you get the full article and maybe only 1 cent from me.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my one cent. Contraception is a huge issue in the orthodox Jewish community. In general, its use is managed by the rabbis. Couples are discouraged from using birth control in general.</p>
<p><span id="more-5759"></span></p>
<p>In some more liberal communities within the yeshivish community, newly married couples are being granted a few months of contraception use. This is because there has been a spate of quick divorces in the community so they are encouraged to use birth control just to make sure they aren&#8217;t stuck with a baby on the way and a crumbling marriage.</p>
<p>Once the couple is comfortably married, they are expected to have a large family. Birth control is usually permitted for at least a year after a baby is born. That&#8217;s it. More than that requires asking the rabbi. The rabbis usually give a few months. Then the couple asks again and they get a few weeks. They ask again, the rabbi tries to convince them it is time to have another baby. At this point the couple has four options. 1) Listen to the rabbi. 2) Ignore the rabbi and risk lose respect for rabbinic guidance. 3) Explain to the rabbi why it is impossible to have another baby because of financial pressures (he will say Hashem will help), or because there is too much stress from motherhood (he will say to get domestic help), or because of the mother&#8217;s emotional or physical health (that might do the trick) and hopefully the rabbi will grant a longer reprieve. 4) Lie about the things mentioned in 3.</p>
<p>I hear things. People tell me things. I get emails. I get phone calls. It seems the most popular option these days are #1 and #4. Some people just listen. They have large families and even if some don&#8217;t really want large families, they do it and just chalk it up to the price of being a <em>Frum Yid</em>. But many others end up lying or stretching the truth just so the rabbi will let them use birth control.</p>
<p>Sometimes the rabbis even want to talk to the wives and they try to show them that having children is so important and some have even said that it is more important than their relationships with their husbands.</p>
<p>I have heard these things from men and women, first hand. Some are disappointed, most feel discouraged, and all are upset.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a problem here.</p>
<p>To what extent should couples be able to make their own decision about contraception? To what extent should rabbis be pulling the strings here? What do the sources say about birth control? Is it really a rabbi&#8217;s decision? Is there another way?</p>
<p>Enter this excellent article by Rabbis Mayer and Messner.</p>
<p>I love this article. It goes through the sources very thoroughly and ultimately favors personal decision making and autonomy over blind adherence to authority. In a macro sense, <em>this is how I feel orthodox Judaism works best</em>. Educate yourself on a subject, and make an informed decision that falls within the parameters of halacha on your own. That is the basic premise of the article.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t ruin the article by snatching the punchline. Read the article for yourself. It is worth your time and should be understandable to most people with a basic Torah education.</p>
<p>As a an additional benefit, the writers of the article will be checking in to answer questions and respond to your comments. So please, by all means, maximize this opportunity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/xojane_logo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5611" title="xojane_logo" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/xojane_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C102" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>(If you haven&#8217;t read Chaya&#8217;s article, you&#8217;ll need to read that first. Click: <a href="http://www.xojane.com/relationships/hasidic-women-sex" target="_blank">XOJane</a>)</em></p>
<p>I am very happy that you have found personal satisfaction in your religious life. I am also happy you took to the Internet to profess your love for your personal relationship with God (and apparently your husband). I honestly wish every orthodox Jewish woman was as religiously fulfilled as you are. However, sadly this is not the case.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real issues I take with your effusive article.</p>
<p>You represented your subjective experience as the objective experience of chasidic women. Making things worse, you failed to disclose in the article many important factors that contributed to your personal experience. Indeed, you made them clear in the comments, but it was too little, too late.</p>
<p><span id="more-5610"></span></p>
<p>You were not born into orthodox Judaism. That means that you actually chose the life you live. That&#8217;s amazing and I am so happy for you that you arrived at what I believe to be the truth on your own. But the simple fact is that people who are born into orthodox Judaism don&#8217;t choose it. This means that they are stuck. For better or for worse. Some people are thrilled to be stuck. Others, not so much. But this means that while you feel like you are free to as you please. I am sure you realize that if an orthodox woman would put on &#8220;pants and go snort coke&#8221; she would probably be asked to leave the community and be handed a quick divorce and lose custody of her children. So it is not as free as you intimate. It might feel free to you because you chose it. But it is not free.</p>
<p>The second thing that you did not disclose, and this is a far more egregious error, is that you are a member of the Chabad sect of chasidus. The reason this is so crucial is because Chabad is different than every single other chasidic sect. There are absolutely no social correlations between Chabad and the other sects of chasidus. None.</p>
<p>In the words of Hella Winston (quoted from <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/29/book-review-unchosen/" target="_blank">Unchosen</a>):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With its “mitzvah tanks”, campus Chabad houses, celebrity stuffed fundraising telethons, and outposts across the globe, Lubavitch has become almost synonymous with Hasidism. This despite the fact that in the United State it numbers less than half the size of Satmar and is hardly representative of the Hasidic community as a whole. With their mission – unique in the Hasidic world – to attract unaffiliated Jews, Lubavitchers are raised to engage (Jewish) outsiders, doing missionary work wherever Jews are found around the world. [&#8230;]</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This emphasis on proselytizing has meant that a significant percentage of Lubavitchers were not born in the community but joined by choice. Often those who join [&#8230;] have led formerly secular lives, which likely included a college education or beyond. [&#8230;] Additionally, Lubavitch raises a substantial amount of money from non-Hasidic Jews [&#8230;]. All of this is strong contrast to the other Hasidic sects, which include Satmar, Ger, Viznitz, Belz, Bobov, Skver, Sponka, Pupa and Breslow, to name only a few. In these sects, almost all members are born into the community, and none engages in formal outreach, making them comparatively more insulated from , and less aware of, the ways of the outside society than their counterparts in Lubavitch.</em></p>
<p>You see, the insular chasidic sects bear no resemblance to this world you love. Their world is even more closed and more insular. So your personal experience, while wonderful, has no relevance to the world of chasidic women in the insular sects of Satmar, Ger, Vizhnitz, Square, etc. More importantly, their world is a world where women are more oppressed than in the rest of orthodox Judaism. There are rules against driving, getting an education, men and women walk on separate sides of the street in some communities, there are very strict rules about sex, many women shave their heads, girls are wed after extremely short meetings to young men they barely know, they must wear synthetic (bad looking) wigs, can&#8217;t wear latest fashions (even the modest ones), I could go on and on. The point is that in these communities, women don&#8217;t feel the great freedom and empowerment that you feel.</p>
<p>Ironically, by ignoring all this omitted information, you are causing a disservice to chasidic women everywhere. You make it sound like things are all honky-dory. But they are not. I am sure many chasidic women love their lot in life. But your experience has no bearing on theirs. In fact, I would bet you wouldn&#8217;t last a week in Kiryas Joel or New Square! The things you love about your Judaism are simply not present in those uber-insular communities.</p>
<p>But the most difficult thing about your article is that it completely ignores that plain fact that in halacha, women can easily be perceived as second class citizens. This is an incontrovertible fact. Women cannot be rabbis, cantors, judges, witnesses in Beis Din, and they aren&#8217;t counted as part of a minyan. Women&#8217;s dress codes are medieval, their stained underwear is checked by rabbis, they are discouraged from using contraception, they don&#8217;t study the most important text of orthodox Judaism &#8211; the Talmud (because they are assumed to have weaker minds), and they don&#8217;t take positions of authority. Heck the women in Crown Heights are not even allowed to vote on communal issues! I am well aware of the various apologetics and interpretations of these rules. It could be argued that women have an elevated role and do not require the encumbrances of mitzvah observance. I have used them and taught them myself. Some people buy those explanations, but many others do not. It&#8217;s great that so many orthodox Jewish women are happy with their place in orthodox Judaism, but it is completely reasonable for women inside the system and outside the system to perceive orthodox Judaism as oppressive to women.</p>
<p>In sum, I respect your healthy exuberance for your Chabad lifestyle. I think it&#8217;s great. Share the love. By all means. But please do not generalize and use terms like &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; to describe your personal experience. Not only is it disingenuous, it actually harms the cause of those who are trying to advocate for women&#8217;s rights and opportunities in the chasidic and otherwise orthodox Jewish women. The future of orthodox Judaism will need to make adjustments to the way we deal with women issues (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/13/the-future-of-women-in-orthodox-judaism/">The Future of Women in Orthodox Judaism</a>). Pretending it is perfect as it is, sets us backwards several decades.</p>

The author grew up in an environment where she was required to dress very modestly. She wore clothes the would not attract attention and was conscious of her appearance at all times. Unfortunately, her story took a sad turn when she developed an eating disorder in college. The point of the article is that modesty gave her the eating disorder.</p>
<p>It almost sounds like she could have grown up in one of many orthodox Jewish communities.</p>
<p>However the author is not Jewish. She was raised in a religious community that practices <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branhamism" target="_blank">Branhamism</a> and is known as &#8220;The Message of the Hour&#8221;. I believe this a key to establishing the difference between what her experience was with modesty and our modesty ideals.</p>
<p>The author writes that she was taught that modesty is an element of submitting to man&#8217;s world. She must be vigilant not to arouse a man under any circumstance. She was led to believe that she was always on display and that any slight furtive movement could be one that ruins her. She was even told as much by members of her community on more than one occasion. In her view, modesty meant she was always on display to be judged by men. She felt like she was to be hidden behind a curtain.</p>
<p>Some people have commented that this is the wrong way to approach modesty and she was taught about modesty incorrectly.<span id="more-5308"></span></p>
<p>So I did some research (by research, I mean I went to Wikipedia) and it seems that she was instilled with the messages of Branhamism as they are meant to be understood. See this paragraph on modesty:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Message believers hold to a literal interpretation of the Bible’s references to the role of women. Women are not allowed to preach or teach (1 Timothy 2:12) although they may testify, teach Sunday School, pray aloud, and operate the vocal gifts of the Spirit (1 Cor 12:10). Wives are taught to be in subjection to their husbands (1 Peter 3:1) and that they should have long hair (1 Corinthians 11:15). Divorce and remarriage is permitted for men &#8220;for the cause of fornication&#8221; (Matthew 5:31-32) but not for women.[34] (&#8220;Fornication&#8221; is defined as &#8220;undisclosed pre-marital sexual intercourse&#8221; by most groups, although some also include adultery as a just cause). Women are expected to dress &#8220;modestly&#8221; which means avoiding tight or revealing clothing as well as any garment that &#8220;pertaineth unto a man&#8221; (Deuteronomy 22:5), such as pants, shorts, slacks, overalls, etc.[35] Branham&#8217;s followers believe that using makeup is wrong because the only woman in the Bible who painted her face was Jezebel (2 Kings 9:30).</em></p>
<p>So, was it so farfetched that the author of the article understood the meaning of modesty as she did? I don&#8217;t think so. Using Biblical narratives as the model of modesty is bound to make modern women feel like the ancients. That is the point.</p>
<p>I think it is important for our community to recognize that there are unhealthy ways of preaching modesty. They could lead to disastrous results. It could lead to eating disorders, poor self-image, marital issues, obsessive compulsive disorder, and many other social or emotional problems. The lesson of the article is not to scrap modesty. It is to learn how not to impart it to our students and children.</p>
<p>I think the healthiest way to teach modesty is for it to be balanced and part of a broader approach to religious life. It cannot be the most important thing. It cannot be the thing by which we judge and are judged. It must be a personal desire to be comfortable and confident in who we are that we don&#8217;t feel the social pressure to dress provocatively. It would be even better if we could find a way out of the rigid social norms that now plague orthodox Jewish modesty. Where fitting in is equated with modesty and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/03/14/excellent-article-in-tablet-about-modesty-and-contemporary-orthodox-judaism/" target="_blank">Tznius Inflation</a> raises the stakes every few months. In a different time, a posek might have even been willing to allow modest pants to be worn seeing as they are not &#8220;for men&#8221; nor are they immodest. But we live in an orphaned generation bereft of halachic innovation. And even if a posek was willing to take a step out of the box, the public would likely reject it. This is just an unfortunate reality of our time.</p>
<p>At the very least, we should be sure to educate our community about the harms of eating disorders and other social problems associated with self-image. Although it may unintentional, placing such emphasis on the way we look and the way we dress, even for religious reasons, can create problems far worse than showing too much skin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WomensSiddur.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5033" title="WomensSiddur" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WomensSiddur.png?resize=236%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Rabbi Julie Schonfeld makes an outrageous claim and Ha&#8217;aretz runs with it.</p>
<p>The claim? A version of a siddur published in the 15th century contains the blessing <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em>. The blessing thanks God for making the one reciting the benediction a woman and not a man. Rabbi Schonfeld contends that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>&#8220;This Siddur </em><strong>proves</strong><em> that the degrading attitudes towards women, which we are seeing in certain extreme religious communities in Israel today, are a modern distortion of Judaism. Ironically, treatment of women in certain extreme sectors of the community is far more denigrating to women today than even the attitudes of the late Middle Ages.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>While I sympathize with Rabbi Schonfeld&#8217;s efforts in this regard, this siddur &#8220;proves&#8221; absolutely nothing of the sort. The siddur, which has been floating around the Internet for quite a few years now despite the attempt to portray this as an amazing new discovery, only proves that one woman had this siddur written on her behalf. It does not prove anything about the attitudes toward women in Medieval times.</p>
<p>Although, I would argue that the treatment of women in some Jewish communities in today&#8217;s day and age is not rooted in halacha as much as it is rooted in traditional, old-fashioned values that may or may not be compatible with halacha, Judaism or Torah. They are two separate things. But the siddur does not prove that. Nor does it prove that women were treated any better or worse in Medieval Europe.</p>
<p>The siddur, however <em>does </em>prove something very important in my eyes.<span id="more-5030"></span> It proves that the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> is not as nefarious as it seems. See, if a woman is willing to say <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em> she must not feel that it is a degrading blessing. It would be extremely hypocritical for an oppressed group to turn around and use the same degrading terminology against the group that is oppressing them. It would be like civil rights activists in 1965 organizing a bus with black people in the front and white people in the back. Reversing the roles in degrading situations is hardly a fair or open-minded approach to the problem.</p>
<p>It seems, that neither the one who makes the blessing <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em> nor the one who makes the blessing <em>shelo asani isha</em> is meant to be degrading. Rather, both are blessings expressing appreciation for one&#8217;s place in life. Both blessing are ways of practicing the concept of being happy with one&#8217;s lot. Just like one can be happy as a man and not a woman, one can be happy as a woman and not a man. Even if one has more commandments than the other.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this single instance of a woman having her own blessing validates the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em>. It shows that the true meaning of blessing is that one blesses whatever their situation happens to be. It is not an expression of superiority, nor is it an expression of oppression. It is just a blessing.</p>
<p>I understand that this will not change the perception of the public. I do believe that the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> appears offensive to outsiders (and even most to insiders who need to wrestle with apologetics to make it less offensive). I think the most effective way of preserving this ancient blessing is to understand what a blessing really is all about. Seeing a woman&#8217;s prayerbook with <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em> affirms to me that the blessing is not meant as a <em>tziduk ha&#8217;din</em> or an expression of having more mitzvos. Rather, it is an opportunity to thank God for one&#8217;s place in this world.</p>
<p>It is my hope that the public can accept that this blessing is not derogatory in intention or application. Rabbi Schonfeld&#8217;s new favorite siddur helps make that point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5006" title="argue" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/argue-300x216.jpg?resize=300%2C216" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/01/02/yossi-sarid-shows-us-the-ugly-side-of-secular-extremism/" target="_blank">Yesterday, I wrote about Yossi Sarid&#8217;s disgraceful article of vile hatred for halachic Judaism</a>. I expressed my discomfort in writing a point by point response because when first started to write a point by point rebuttal, it came off as sounded apologetic and disingenuous. I was not able to articulate how and why Sarid was wrong in every one of his examples. I tried. But I was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yair Hoffman also tried. His article is a lot like the one I was writing. It explains a few of the statements that Sarid misquoted or misinterpreted. More importantly it provides quite a few important sources that indicate reverence, respect and admiration for women in the Talmud. Clearly, Sarid ignores as many, if not more, sources than he barbarically wields in his unscrupulous attack on halacha.</p>
<p>This is great work by Rabbi Hoffman. But in the end all he has done is presented another side to the story. He has shown that the Talmud has statements that are praiseworthy or women and there are also statements that portray women negatively. This is because he does not refute the majority of Sarid&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>I decided to analyze the debate systematically.<span id="more-5004"></span></p>
<p>Saird mentions 16 negative sources in his article. Rabbi Hoffman addresses FOUR of them. Of the TWELVE he ignores, some of them are the most difficult to explain.</p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman uses a variety of methods to refute the four sources he actually addresses.</p>
<p>Sarid says: <em>&#8220;She is unfit for any public position with authority. &#8220;Thou shalt appoint a king over thee&#8221; &#8211; a king and not a queen.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman employs the &#8220;it is literal but it&#8217;s not so bad&#8221; argument. Meaning, yes it is true, but many other cultures and countries have had similar laws. Okay. Fair enough.</p>
<p>Sarid says: <em>&#8221; words of Torah should be burned rather than being given to women.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman correctly declares that this is out of context. It is true that the Talmud says this in the name of one rabbi, but since the Talmud actually addresses the question the woman asked that prompted the statement, clearly the rabbis felt that the question was a good question and this is really praise of a woman. While all of this is true, the statement remains in the text unchallenged. This is still offensive. Advantage Sarid.</p>
<p>Sarid mentions the prohibition against one who <em>&#8221; looks even at a woman&#8217;s little finger&#8221;.</em></p>
<p><em></em> Rabbi Hoffman explains that this is actually a preferred approach to women. In effect in &#8216;deobjectifies&#8217; women because it ensures that women will not be looked at as pure objects of desire. In fact it ensures that women will not be looked at, at all. Not a great job by Rabbi Hoffman, he could have added that the translation of Sarid is not perfect. It would be more accurate to state that the prohibition is against &#8220;gazing&#8221; at a women with lust.</p>
<p>One of Sarid&#8217;s last complaints is the statement in the Talmud that &#8220;calls women&#8221;, and I quote, <em>&#8220;a sack full of excrement&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman is absolutely correct here. Sarid willfully distorts this source. The Talmud is saying that EVEN if a woman was a  &#8220;a sack full of excrement&#8221; a man would desire her physically. This is a statement about the strength of physical attraction. It is not a referendum on women. Sarid loses this one badly.</p>
<p>So in the four points of attack, Rabbi Hoffman argues valiantly. In some places he is better than others. But he does a good job.</p>
<p>The problem is that there are TWELVE more sources that go unaddressed. Among them, the most difficult to reconcile. Rabbi Hoffman does not address the law that prohibits women from testifying in court or becoming a judge, nor does he address the statement criticizing those who teach their daughters Torah. He ignores the obligation to save a drowning man before a drowning woman, he ignores the Talmud&#8217;s statement that allows men to divorce without his wife&#8217;s consent and the requirement that women be at her husband&#8217;s disposal when he desires her.</p>
<p>Some of these statements can be explained. Others really cannot. In some ways Sarid is right. The world does not look upon many of these laws and statements favorably.</p>
<p>In none of his explanations does Rabbi Hoffman invoke the argument that things may have changed since the time of the Talmud. In no place does he say that the statements in the Talmud are reflective of an ancient society and that we have evolved from that society into a more contemporary version of Rabbinic Judaism. Rabbi Hoffman is not willing to say, in any case, that these any of sources are actually offensive and have fallen into disuse or reinterpreted because they are offensive.</p>
<p>In my opinion, that might be the only way to answer some of the questions raised by Sarid. But for some, saying this amounts to kefira or at least knocks one out of orthodox Judaism. But isn&#8217;t it true? Have we not adapted and evolved since the times of the Talmud? I think we have. I think it is also futile to deny it. I would really love to see a bona fide, contemporary Torah authority legitimize this approach. I can dream, can&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>This approach will not answer all the questions either. It will not fix some of the built-in disadvantages that women encounter in halachic Judaism. But I think it is more honest and gives us a chance to continue to adapt and evolve if necessary <em>and if our rabbinic leadership allows it</em>. But freezing us in time as Rabbi Hoffman has done will not win every argument. In this case it only won four out of sixteen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/220px-Yossi_Sarid.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4998" title="220px-Yossi_Sarid" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/220px-Yossi_Sarid-210x300.jpg?resize=210%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>I read the recent op-ed written by Yossi Sarid and published in Haaretz. I found the article highly offensive, despicable and ugly. I thought I would &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking" target="_blank">fisk</a>&#8221; the article and counter each and every one of Sarid&#8217;s twisted, angry points. I got through about half of Sarid&#8217;s ugly diatribe and I was forced to quit. I could not win. I was unable to refute every one of his points without twisting myself, Chazal and halacha into a stale pretzel.</p>
<p>So I gave up.</p>
<p>Instead, I offer two independant points in this blog post inspired by Sarid&#8217;s disgraceful article.</p>
<p>Sarid&#8217;s main point is that the extremists in Israel are only applying the lessons that are taught in our holy tradition. He proceeds to quote several sources that demonstrate his view of the way Judaism treats women. A few of his sources are misquoted. A few others are opinions of one rabbi and not every rabbi. But by and large, one can build a solid case against orthodox Judaism&#8217;s approach to women using Sarid&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>By pointing to these sources, Sarid proposes that the extremists are just following the logical conclusions of halacha and traditional Judaism. Therefore the problem is not the extremists, the problem is all Jews who adhere to halacha. All forms of Judaism that believe in the veracity of Torah are to blamed. This is akin to one of Hitchens&#8217; more well-known arguments against religion. If extremists can follow the text of a religion and be bad people there is a flaw in the religion. Sarid lumps all Jews who follow halacha together. The extremists are extremists but only because they follow the same texts as I do, they just do it better.</p>
<p>Sarid is wrong. Dead Wrong.<span id="more-4997"></span> He is wrong because the extremists may be following the texts that he cites. But halachic Judaism does not follow those texts today. Yes. Believe it or not, even the most charedi of Jews do not have the same beliefs about women that some of our great rabbis had throughout our history. He claims that halacha prohibits teaching women Torah. This is obviously very easy to refute. Every orthodox Jewish woman studies Torah. This is an evolution of Judaism to conform to modernity. Some things are up for negotiation. Some things are not. But to represent orthodox Judaism as a whole by quoting a few obscure (and few less obscure) texts is ugly.</p>
<p>It is ugly because in practice, 99% of orthodox Jews don&#8217;t agree with the texts he quoted. The 1% who do are the extremists. Thus, is it disingenuous and provocative to lump all orthodox Jews together with regard to the way women are treated in orthodox Judaism. For this I am fuming with anger at Yossi Sarid. How dare he take a few quotes and a few crazies and paint the entire spectrum of orthodox Judaism with that brush? It is inexcusable. I hope he can find his way and retract his article. An apology would be appropriate as well.</p>
<p>The second point is that these texts do exist. They do need to be dealt with in a mature way. I am not qualified to dismiss these texts and I would not dare make a unilateral statement about these texts. But it would be wise for our rabbinic leadership (and by <em>our</em> rabbinic leadership, I mean the orthodox Jewish leadership from across the spectrum) to formulate responses and interpretations or dismissals of these texts. We need to have an approach that codifies the modern approaches that we have taken towards women over the last few centuries. The offensive texts cannot remain the only authoratative views on women.</p>
<p>It is clear and without a doubt that attitudes have changed towards women over the last 2500 years. This is not a Jewish phenomenon. Women have only had the right to vote and own land for a relatively short amount of time in the secular world. Jewish law has adapted as well. Women work outside the home. Women learn Torah. Women are expected to be treated with as much respect as one would like to be treated by others.</p>
<p>The problem is that the most authoratative sources that remain are those that are no longer followed by the majority of orthodox Jews. We need to educate ourselves and hateful people like Yossi Sarid that neither those texts, nor the extremists represent mainstream halachic Judaism.</p>
<p>I suggest you read Sarid&#8217;s diatribe. If only so that you should know what kind of perception one can have if one cherry picks from the traditional sources and to try to figure a way to explain these texts without becoming overly apologetic and without rejecting the sanctity of our tradition.</p>
<p>As much as I hate what the religious extremists are doing to pervert Torah Judaism, I hate what Yossi Sarid has written even more.</p>

Riding in the back of the bus has become identified with discrimination.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that when Hillary! Clinton, feminist extraordinaire, expressed her dismay when she heard that a democratic country like Israel had bus routes that were segregated by gender. On several bus routes in Israel men are in the front and women ride in back.</p>
<p>Hillary!&#8217;s comments drew the ire of many religious Jews. To them, this was such a minor issue in the grand scheme of things, and so unrelated to foreign affairs that Hillary! could only have been commenting on the bus situation because she is a jerk / anti-Semite / hates Israel / liberal / feminist / whatever. Now, I concede that Hillary! probably should not have created a big deal out of the segregated buses. However, I agree with her dismay.</p>
<p>There are three very big problems with these segregated buses.<span id="more-4964"></span></p>
<p>1) They are illegal. I am indebted to <a href="twitter.com/noahroth" target="_blank">Noah Roth</a> for summarizing the Supreme Court of Israel&#8217;s ruling that public transportation may not be segregated. The reasoning for the holding is similar to the separate <em>is not</em> equal argument that was made in Brown v. Board of Education in the Supreme Court of the United States. The bus drivers are not supposed to let the bus riders enforce a &#8220;voluntary&#8221; segregation and there is litigation in the lower Israeli courts right now attempting to force the drivers to enforce the law.</p>
<p>2) They are halachically unnecessary. Halachically speaking, there is no requirement for segregation between men and women. Some will argue that men and women are not allowed to touch each other and incidental touching is very likely to occur in a crowded bus. This has already been deemed a non-issue by R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein (Even HaEver 5:14). In his responsa, R&#8217; Moshe says that incidental touching on a bus is not a problem because it is not &#8220;derech chiba&#8221; which means that it is not intimate touching. (Again, HT Noah Roth for the cite.)</p>
<p>3) Segregated buses are a big deal with minimal benefit. Let&#8217;s assume that &#8220;kedushas einayim&#8221; is a super-vital element of worshiping God. (I believe it is overblown, but lets pretend that it&#8217;s not overblown for a moment). Does that mean that it is more valuable than many other Torah values? Does that mean that it is more important to have one&#8217;s eyes averted by default than it is to demean women?</p>
<p>If you are an apologist, you are saying to yourself that the women volunteer to move to the back, so what is the big deal? The big deal is the message it sends. It sends a message to the public that we appear to discriminate against women. Even if you don&#8217;t believe that seperate buses are discriminatory, and I concede that in some situations they might not be, they send a message to the less informed public that we do discriminate. This is an awful message. Not only does it affect our interactions with our non-Jewish friends and neighbors but I believe that the message of segregated buses to the public reflects back upon us and affirms to us that we are in fact discriminating. In other words, what others think of us can affect how we feel about our own actions.</p>
<p>But I think the more important message is the message we give ourselves when we institute (or tolerate) separate buses.  The message is that people are so highly sexualized that a casual encounter with any woman is enough to wreak havoc on a man&#8217;s soul. This is not a new trend, but no less disturbing. Charedi periodicals don&#8217;t show pictures of women. Even modestly dressed women. Even saintly women. None. (Let&#8217;s not forget that Hillary! was photoshopped out of a historic photo by a Charedi publication.) Little girls are not portrayed either. In fact, I&#8217;ve seen periodicals that had the faces of female INFANTS blurred out. That is sick.</p>
<p>This is a real problem. First of all, it legitimizes thinking sexually about every female in the world. It&#8217;s as if there is no choice. Women are purely sexual and we are helpless to our base desires. It says that it is impossible for men and women to interact normally.</p>
<p>It also tells our community that women are required to be out of the public eye no matter what. They are the unseen and unheard part of our community. I believe we lose a strong voice in our community if women are marginalized or at the least, made to think that that they suffer an incurable disease of attractiveness. We should focus our attention and efforts into learning how to function as normal, healthy, well-adjusted people in a society of men and women. Fighting this hard for separate buses indicates a horrible state of missed priorities.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the buses will reintegrate and holy Jews will learn how to be holy in the real world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/6-Suffragist-Picketing4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4349" title="6 Suffragist Picketing(4)" alt="" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/6-Suffragist-Picketing4.jpg?resize=300%2C288" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I am a big fan of Hakirah, a really nicely done Torah journal. I was turned onto the publication by a friend of mine who was published in the journal and am now a subscriber.</p>
<p>The most recent Hakirah attempted to begin to tackle the issue of women in the rabbinate. It began with a short article from <strong>Rabbi Herschel Schachter</strong> who did not do the subject justice but concluded, based on the laws of <em>tznius</em>, that a position such as Rabbi is not a preferable place for men or women due to its very public nature. However in choosing who should perform the public duties of a Rabbi, it is better to have men in a position of non-tznius than women.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s article is interesting but too short. It leaves way too much wiggle room and seems to be referring mostly to women pulpit rabbis.</p>
<p>The next article does a much more comprehensive job of dealing with the issue. Its authors are <strong>Rabbi Michael Broyde</strong> and <strong>Rabbi Shlomo Brody</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first broached this topic on this blog I did so in the context of social change. (PLEASE READ: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/23/patience-is-a-virtue-and-an-important-ingredient-for-change/">Patience Is A Virtue and An Important Ingredient For Change</a>) My premise is that all social change happens slowly. Change that is too quick or premature can backfire. I predicted that women would continue to see more prominent roles in areas of religious leadership over time.</p>
<p>My good friend <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a> vehemently disagreed with this wait and see approach. <span id="more-4344"></span>In his mind an injustice cannot be tolerated at all. Since he feels that the current situation for women in orthodox Judaism is an injustice, patience is a curse, not a cure. Now DovBear is entitled to shriek from the rooftops but that doesn&#8217;t mean anything will change. Personally, I am concerned with real change not just proclamations.</p>
<p>I view the issue primarily as a social one, not a <em>halachic</em> one. The reason for this is that I believe that the law will adapt to the social environment. However this is only possible if there is a halachic mechanism to give women a more prominent role in religious leadership. It has been demonsrated by Rabbis Broyde and Brody that it can. Certainly it can also be prohibited by law if one makes certain halachic decisions. But it would be equally halachically acceptable to adapt what is currently halachically acceptable. One major factor the Rabbis cite, is the public needs, desires and perception.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend reading the full article. I have uploaded an annotated version of the article with specific key points underlined. Read that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Vol-11-Broyde.pdf" target="_blank">Hakirah Vol 11</a>.</p>
<p>My summary of the women in religious leadership roles in orthodox Judaism is as follows:</p>
<p>Many women in the Bible are heroes. They frequently possess keener insight than their male counterparts. Sometimes they are stronger than the men. Other times they play a secondary role, but star anyway. <em>Midrashim</em> also speak highly of women. In the law, women are afforded much more liberty and equality than in other ancient legal systems. In ancient times, the Torah was a progressive woman&#8217;s best hope. There is no indication in the Torah that women could not and should not be able to achieve the same level of scholarship or religious leadership as men. The one example where women are severely limited is in becoming king or by extension any other position of <em>serara.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Talmud</em> has several statements that seem to disparage women. The most classic example is the oft repeated prohibition against teaching women Torah. The Talmud explains this statement by one <em>Tanna</em> in a <em>Mishna</em> with the statement &#8220;<em>Nashim daatam kalos</em>&#8220;. Which literally translated means that women are weak-minded and since that is the case, it is futile to teach them Torah. The Rambam codifies this into halacha.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, for the bulk of the last 2000 years since the beginning of the Mishnaic period the sentiment that women are inferior has been accepted as fact. It is plain as day to see this fact when considering the great lengths women had to go in order to get equal rights in the greatest democracy in the world. Even as few as 103 years ago, the Supreme Court has no problem publishing an opinion based on the fact that women were primarily vehicles of reproductivity and must be protected from working too many hours lest we harm their reproductive prowess. As per the summary on Oyez.org &#8220;Brewer&#8217;s opinion conveyed the accepted wisdom of the day: that women were unequal and inferior to men.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1901-1939/1907/1907_107" target="_blank">Muller v. Oregon</a>).</p>
<p>2000 years ago it was a given. Women are inferior. It took thousands of years for the secular world to escape that mentality.</p>
<p>I am aware of the mental gymnastics and apologetics to excuse or &#8220;explain&#8221; what the Talmud meant. To me, they are useless. In a world where women have every opportunity that men have, women are choosing to accomplish things their grandmothers could never have dreamed. Orthodox Jewish women expect and should expect to have similar opportunities within their religion. AH! But it wasn&#8217;t ever this way! We ALWAYS did it the old way! How can we break from Tradition? Worse, are we violating halacha?!</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is no shame in admitting the mistakes of our past. The rabbis in the Talmud were entirely justified in using the feelings and temperament of their era in applying them to Torah and Law. I don&#8217;t believe that we are bound to maintain their opinions of women or anyone. Certainly they were wise and certainly they did the best they could to serve Hashem and teach us for posterity how to do the same. But they were people and people are subject to the notions and vicissitudes of their time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>[I have been accused of being a &#8220;Conservative Rabbi&#8221; and a &#8220;fraud&#8221; for holding this position. I don&#8217;t believe this is a fair criticism. As per the Rambam, the variety of opinions on matters such as these are not part of the Oral Law passed down from Sinai to Moses and beyond. Thus, acknowledging that the rabbis of the Mishna and Talmud were able to formulate their own opinions and were not merely transmitting previously known information that was received at Sinai is not any more the attitude of a &#8220;Conservative Rabbinics&#8221; than it is the attitude of the Rambam.] </em></span></p>
<p>There is no shame in recognizing that the social environment and scientific data have changed our opinion of what women are capable of accomplishing. It would be foolish to assume that women are able to function at the highest levels of academia, science, politics, or any non-physical activity but would be unable to achieve great accomplishments in Torah and religious leadership. Indeed, they can.</p>
<p>The question is &#8220;may they?&#8221;.</p>
<p>To this question Rabbis Broyde and Brody answer a resounding&#8230; &#8220;Possibly&#8221;. But a key to their analysis is public acceptance of change in attitude towards women&#8217;s ever increasing role in orthodox Jewish religious life.</p>
<p>A century ago women had far fewer opportunities than they do today. As I wrote previously, the fact that women can study Torah in schools and places of higher learning and maintain positions of authority in Torah institutions is certainly a great innovation of the last 100 years. It is not to be taken lightly or for granted. The wisdom of our rabbis in allowing this change must be noted. The point is that women are on a track and the track is leading to a place of even greater opportunity for women. The only remaining question is how long it will take to get there.</p>
<p>When the public demands it, it will happen. When it becomes necessary it will happen. When the only obvious choice is to take that train to the next station, it will happen.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am not condoning the recent ordination of orthodox Jewish women as Rabbis (or Rabbas, or whatever). Nor am I proposing that within a few decades women will be taking positions as pulpit rabbis and Roshei Yeshiva. I am saying that there will be more opportunities for scholarship at least on par with the opportunities men have to study Torah vigorously. Correspondingly, there will be a need for women leaders and educators who have demonstrated mastery over their studies. Today, women are chosen as teachers and educators and yet, generally, compared with a mediocre yeshiva student they are ignoramuses. Creating greater opportunities for higher learning will change that. Women who are so inclined will able to receive recognition for scholarship and Torah knowledge. Our children will benefit from better school teachers. Our synagogues will benefit from better Torah classes given by women.</p>
<p>All this being said, it remains a choice for each woman or family to decide. Every family is different and some women may be happy or happier with more traditional roles. But those roles will be borne out of a choice as opposed to lack of choice. It will help women who make either choice, or if they can somehow choose both better Jews and better mother, each in their own way.</p>
<p>What should we do in the meantime? Rabbis Broyde and Brody said it best:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Women should sit and study for increasingly long periods of time, write serious scholarship in Torah, develop as inspiring spiritual personas, and lead Torah institutions, in function if not in form. In short, they should build the Orthodox community brick by brick, and see what happens over time.</em></p>
<p>So to summarize my summary:</p>
<p><em>Women used to be thought of as inferior. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with admitting that. But now we know they aren&#8217;t. They may have different roles. That should not preclude them from scholarship and recognition as Torah scholars and leaders. Eventually it won&#8217;t. Meanwhile, become scholars as best you can. This is all reconcilable with halacha. Of course it is.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Susan B. Anthony" src="http://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Susan_B_Anthony_Older_Years.png?resize=206%2C287" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />The 19th Amendment gave  women the right to vote in the United States 1920. You can thank Susan B. Anthony (over there on the left) for that one. That was 90 years ago. That right to vote is essential because it gives women a voice in communal matters which directly affect them. It is fundamentally unfair to subject women to laws that are created by agencies that have no responsibility to women by virtue of the fact that women have no say whether they get voted or not.</p>
<p>It is really obvious that women must have the right to vote in a democracy.</p>
<p>An interesting issue has been raised in Crown Heights, the headquarters of Lubavitch and in particular regarding the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council. The CHJCC receives millions of dollars in Federal money and provides a huge amount of social services to local families.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s leadership, like the leadership of many orthodox Jewish organizations, is entirely male. The reason the CHJCC is led my males is actually written into its bylaws. In order to vote, one must be religiously observant, married, previously married or at least 30 years old and male.<span id="more-4143"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear to me if the bylaws prevent a woman from being voted into a leadership position, but that is unlikely given that women cannot vote.</p>
<p>There is a halachic precedent for women not taking religious leadership positions. This has been slightly marginalized in the last century with women taking positions of leadership in religious schools. Certainly, many Jewish organizations that are not religious in nature are permitted halachically to have women and do have women in positions of leadership.</p>
<p>Now, a young man from Chabad is challenging the validity of the male requirement.</p>
<p>Unable to use halacha to justify the rule, CHJCC has used a variety of &#8220;excuses&#8221; to explain the rule. modesty (as per usual), &#8220;tradition&#8221; and maintaining a peaceful marriage are among the reasons given during the discussion over this issue.</p>
<p>The current director conceded that the issue of women voting is being reconsidered by the council. A lawyer for the council has promised that women will be able to vote in the next elections.</p>
<p>Feeling that progress was not being made in private, closed door, conversations, the man challenging the council is considering taking the issue to the courts. Legally speaking, this would not a 19th Amendment issue, rather a 14th Amendment issue, under the equal protection clause. It could apply because the council is accepting Federal funds. It&#8217;s not a very strong case and would likely become a very difficult precedent if it required all organizations accepting a penny of Federal funds to adhere to the strict standards of the constitution regarding separation of church and state as well as the slightly discriminatory policies that many religious organizations may have.</p>
<p>Honestly, the policy really bothers me but I don&#8217;t think they would win a constitutional challenge. Especially not these days&#8230;</p>

<p>(What is Hijab? click <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hijab" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Most of us think of the black, shapeless head to toe covering when we think of the Hijab. According the article, the black color, and amorphous shape is not required in Islamic Law. Hijab is a modesty that requires that the body be covered completely by clothing. It is permissible to add color and style to the Hijab.</p>
<p>The article highlights some locals who are celebrating their personal style within the limits of what is required by Hijab.</p>
<p>I think that is great.<span id="more-2531"></span></p>
<p>It is really very similar to the way many orthodox Jewish women follow the Jewish laws of tznius. There are rules of modesty but in no way does that need to hinder one&#8217;s sense of style. Many of the drab dressing folks are just drab dressing folks, it is not that they are more pious in their adherence to tznius. Rather, they just don&#8217;t use the opportunities within the system to look great.</p>
<p>It is important for people that are religious to maintain their standards. But I believe it is also important to modernize the social things that are not determined by religious law. These Muslim women are doing just that. They are taking their religious law and strictly adhering to the law. But they are also making it more comfortable for a 21st Century Woman.</p>
<p>Just as some people are uncomfortable wearing the black, amorphous HIjab, there are those who are uncomfortable when they see women dressed that way. It defies the Western Standards of how women should dress. I understand how it can be offensive. Trying to adapt to a more current way of following Islamic Law is a great way to bridge the gap. The more common ground that is shared between the &#8220;West&#8221; and Islamic World the greater our chances of peace.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1618" title="Obama Basketball" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Pres.Obama_basketball_w_WH.jpg?resize=180%2C240" alt="Obama Basketball" data-recalc-dims="1" />Has the White House traveled back in time and space to the Mad Men era? To a place in time where women are 2nd class citizens and were refused equal opportunities?</p>
<p>Most people would say, &#8220;of course not&#8221;. But there are those who disagree.</p>
<p>Just ask Terry O&#8217;Neill the president for the National Organizatin of Women (NOW) about it. <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/10/now-president-on-president-obamas-allmale-athletic-outings-its-troubling.html" target="_blank">O&#8217;Neill says that this is a real issue</a>.</p>
<p>The brouhaha started with the President&#8217;s pickup basketball games. Apparently, only men have been invited to play so far. According to O&#8217;Neill, this is an affront to women everywhere.</p>
<p>Yes, she is serious.<span id="more-1617"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe, as the Obama Administration has been the portrayed as the most inclusive and minority friendly administration to inhabit the White House.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ridiculous because women don&#8217;t play NBA basketball. It is not because they are discriminated against, but just because they are not as good as the men. Women don&#8217;t have the same physical bodies that men have.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Neill takes this to mean that women are 2nd class. That is her problem. She can take it how she wants, but it would be prudent to be rational about it , as opposed to politically charged and driven. Here is her take:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;we need to see the White House leading the way for desegregating the work places all around the country and it is troubling.&#8221; (Hat tip <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/10/now-president-on-president-obamas-allmale-athletic-outings-its-troubling.html" target="_blank">ABC News Blog</a>)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/us/politics/25vibe.html" target="_blank">NY Times is reporting </a>that the Obama Administration does not think there is a problem here. But the NY Times digs deeper and sees that there is a sense of of &#8220;manliness&#8221; in the White House. And somehow that is a big problem as well.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Still, some high-profile sectors of the White House — economics and national security, for instance — are filled with men and exude an unmistakable male vibe.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So apparantly, not only are women offended by not being invited to play basketball, but women are offended by &#8220;manly&#8221; men in the White House? Is it a crime for a man to be masculine. That sounds to me like discrimination against men!</p>
<p>Women are not expected to be men and men should not be expected to be like women!</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t we all just be what we are and get along?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve come a long way from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" target="_blank">Mad Men</a> era, I think this could be the start of the Mad Women era.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry too much. This just in! <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/a-first-for-president-obama-female-aide-joins-round-of-golf/?scp=1&amp;sq=women%20obama%20basketball&amp;st=Search" target="_blank">Obama has invited a female aide to play golf with him.</a> This is a first and not a moment too soon. Who thinks O&#8217;Neill will be happy with this?</p>
<p>(Not me)</p>

Every post I feel like writing is connected with parenting.</p>
<p>The last time this happened I was hooked on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/clothing/" target="_blank">clothes</a>. Those posts are all linked <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/24/mesillas-yesharim-052409/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/03/the-clothes-make-or-break-the-man-connections-2209/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/13/clothes-in-the-nba/" target="_blank">here</a>. I recommend checking those out.</p>
<p>One of the most popular articles on NYTimes.com this week is an Op-Ed about women&#8217;s happiness.</p>
<p>Cleverly titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/opinion/20dowd.html?_r=1&amp;em" target="_blank">Blue is the New Black</a>&#8220;, the article&#8217;s basic premise is that women having more opportunities and doing more does not contribute to their happiness.<span id="more-1235"></span></p>
<p>Some of the money quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Women around the world are in a funk&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Though women begin their lives more fulfilled than men, as they age, they gradually become less happy&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Choice is inherently stressful&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a bit of an issue with &#8220;Happiness Surveys&#8221; in general, especially across time and space. We all have different definitions of happiness and I find it hard to believe that there is a universal definition that can be compared across 40 years of women.</p>
<p>What disturbed me even more was this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Across the happiness data, the one thing in life that will make you less happy is having children. It’s true whether you’re wealthy or poor, if you have kids late or kids early. Yet I know very few people who would tell me they wish they hadn’t had kids or who would tell me they feel their kids were the destroyer of their happiness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Children are a lot of work. Children take up a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money. But I cannot fathom how people can have such a negative outlook on the effect of children on their lives.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that when one has no children they have more free time. Is free time the key ingredient to happiness in the minds of these people? What is it about children that can guarantee these people will be less happy?</p>
<p>Love is a great feeling. Loving one&#8217;s children must add good feelings to one&#8217;s life. More good feelings should help one feel more happiness. I find it shocking that these parents claim not to find more happiness in their lives.</p>
<p>Further, is happiness something that depends on external factors at all?</p>
<p>To me, happiness is a state of mind that exists irrespective of outside stimuli.</p>
<p>Even if someone is oppressed they can be happy. Even during trying times like tragedy or even Holocaust one can be happy.</p>
<p>Did women&#8217;s roles change in response to <strong>happiness</strong>? I think they changed in deference to <strong>fairness</strong>. In which case the entire article is meaningless. The happiness of women or anyone else was never the issue.</p>
<p>Ms. Dowd makes the issue &#8220;happiness&#8221; and then says &#8220;it didn&#8217;t work&#8221;. Color me confused. Blue or black&#8230;</p>
