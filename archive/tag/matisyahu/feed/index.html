<p>Remember the brouhaha from few months back when Matisyahu shaved his beard? We talked about it extensively on this blog over here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/13/the-shave-heard-round-the-world/">The Shave Heard ‘Round the World</a>. In that post we noted two primary things (in reverse order). 1) A beard is no big deal and 2) Orthodox Judaism is structured by definition and leaving chasidic Judaism might not save him the existential angst of being directed by religious constructs for most of one&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>That incident was directly addressed by Matisyahu and he tried to allay the fears of his orthodox Jewish supporters by letting them know he was still committed to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>This week, Matisayahu seems to have taken more drastic steps in his relationship with orthodox Judaism. Photographs of a bare-headed Matisyahu are circulating the Internet and an article on Ynet indicates that he has abandoned external displays of orthodox Jewish observance. At this moment, no public statement has been issued by Matisyahu to address these developments.<span id="more-5666"></span></p>
<p>First of all, how interesting is it that shaving his beard was &#8220;<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/13/the-shave-heard-round-the-world/">The Shave Heard ‘Round the World</a>&#8221; and this next step has barely registered a peep on the orthodox Jewish richter scale. I can think of three reasons this is the case. 1) A chasid shaving his beard is a bigger deal than a clean shaven orthodox Jew taking off his yarmulka. 2) Once he shaved his beard dropping orthodox Judaism was to be expected (by superficial people) so no one is surprised by this. 3) His public statement helped fuel the discussion last time and this time he has been silent.</p>
<p>More importantly, what are we to make of this story?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin by saying how difficult it must be to live in the music industry and the orthodox Jewish community. Indeed, it seems impossible. Not just because of the challenges inherent in living in two worlds with vastly different priorities, but because of the orthodox community&#8217;s reluctance to accept the compromises that are inevitable in a situation like this one. What I mean is that the orthodox Jewish community has standards that it expects of the people associated with orthodox Judaism. Some of these standards are arbitrary. For example, in some places tznius is more important than honesty in business. Improper dress will invite negative attention but a trial for fraud will not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these standards exist and they are routinely enforced by social convention. I have a feeling that being a rock star crosses the social standards of most orthodox Jewish communities. Despite one&#8217;s personal beliefs and practices, the mere existence of a pop star career is enough to discredit one&#8217;s affiliation with orthodox Judaism. This is not because it is impossible to manage both or that being a Hollywood celebrity is a violation of a Torah or Rabbinic statute. [It is possible and &#8220;I told you so&#8221; sentiments are awfully childish]. It is because the social environment of orthodox Judaism simply does not tolerate it.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that a bare-headed male is likely to be considered persona non grata in the orthodox Jewish community. This is true despite the possibility that the bare-headed Jewish male is more stringent in a myriad of other laws and customs. In other words, the true level of one&#8217;s observance becomes irrelevant. The lines are drawn and enforced by social convention, not objective truth.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that in many industries, men go to work without a yarmulka and just 30 years ago it was considered acceptable and normal for orthodox Jewish males to go to work without a yarmulka. Isn&#8217;t Matisyahu entitled to the same latitude in his line of work? Somehow, I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Most importantly, in my opinion, is the predictable complaint of the orthodox Jewish Mayisyahu fan.<em> &#8220;Matisyahu, you were our hero, how could you do this to us? How could you abandon us? Don&#8217;t you see how much it pains us to see you struggle with your religious observance?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, this is obscene. None of us own Matisyahu. He doesn&#8217;t need to consider us when he makes his choices. It&#8217;s his life and he needs to live with whatever decision he makes. We don&#8217;t. In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion that all the pressure of &#8220;representing orthodox Judaism&#8221; had more than a little bit of a negative effect on Matisyahu. Imagine a world where your every action is scrutinized by the media on the one side and on the other side by your fellow orthodox Jews. Imagine having to live up to the impossible standard of perfection that was seemingly demanded of him. Imagine a life where one&#8217;s choice to become orthodox / chasidic no longer felt like a choice and instead felt like living up to someone else&#8217;s perception of what one should be.</p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t have been easy.</p>
<p>And so I say, let the poor man be. Obviously he is going to through a lot. Some of the most talented people in the world deal with so much existential angst. Stop propping him up to be our religious superhero. Don&#8217;t expect anything out of him other than good, (hopefully) clean, inspirational music. He is not our paradigm or example of perfection. He is just another Jewish dude struggling with the same things we all struggle with albeit in a much more public manner.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/matisyahu_beardless.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4906" title="matisyahu_beardless" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/matisyahu_beardless.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This morning, Matisyahu shaved his beard.</p>
<p>Matisyahu, the self-proclaimed chasidic reggae pop-star, has always identified as an orthodox, chasidic Jew since his rise to stardom almost a decade ago. His signature look was that of a chasidic man. He had an untrimmed beard, long side locks and wore the chasidic garb. All of this while singing songs that made it on the pop charts.</p>
<p>Matisyahu explained his sudden departure from religiously inspired hirsute facial hair maintenance:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>No more Chassidic reggae superstar.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Sorry folks, all you get is me&#8230;no alias. When I started becoming religious 10 years ago it was a very natural and organic process. It was my choice. My journey to discover my roots and explore Jewish spirituality&#8211;not through books but through real life. At a certain point I felt the need to submit to a higher level of religiosity&#8230;to move away from my intuition and to accept an ultimate truth. I felt that in order to become a good person I needed rules&#8211;lots of them&#8211;or else I would somehow fall apart. I am reclaiming myself. Trusting my goodness and my divine mission.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Get ready for an amazing year filled with music of rebirth. And for those concerned with my naked face, don&#8217;t worry&#8230;you haven&#8217;t seen the last of my facial hair. &#8211; Matisyahu</em></p>
<p>Many people interpreted this as a departure from orthodox Judaism. They felt that this meant that Matisyahu was reverting to his pre-orthodox Jewish lifestyle and would no longer identify as an orthodox Jew. Heeb Magazine made this point in the most cynical way possible.<span id="more-4905"></span></p>
<p>After an Internet firestorm, Matisyahu clarified his newfound religious freedom with a more careful statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>For all of those who are being awesome, you are awesome. For all those who are confused: today I went to the Mikva and Shul just like yesterday.</em></p>
<p>So, it seems that all the bellyaching and nervous twitching over losing the one and only orthodox Jewish pop star and the first since my friend Evan from Evan and Jaron paved the way for Matisyahu, was premature and overly judgmental.</p>
<p>This leads me to two less than obvious thoughts. (I&#8217;ll save the obvious thoughts for the obvobloggers. You know who you are.)</p>
<p>First, Matisyahu must think that non-chasidic orthodox Judaism (NCOJ) has less rules than chasidic orthodox Judaism (COJ). This is not necessarily the truth. What is true is that COJ has more rules about appearance and external practices than NCOJ. Further, NCOJ is adopting more and more of the COJ appearances and rules on appearance.</p>
<p>By and large, I think this is a fair distinction. COJ glamorizes a certain mode of dress and appearance as holy. NCOJ also glamorizes a certain mode of dress and appearance as holy but it is less distinctive and less sharply enforced. So I hope Matisyahu is not too disappointed with NCOJ when it comes to appearances. That is, unless he will be self-identifying as Modern Orthodox or a Yekke. Those two groups are the least concerned with external appearances within the orthodox Jewish spectrum.</p>
<p>Second, the beard. To some, especially those in the COJ community, the beard is holy. It has religious significance. It is not to be touched by human hand, scissor, shaver, razor or garden shears. This idea is based on mystical teachings and kabbalah. This religiously inspired love for man-hair contributed to the shocking, but brief image of a religiously shattered Matisyahu. One blogger announced that he was &#8220;off the derech&#8221; because he had shaved.</p>
<p>When Matisyahu announced he had shaved, I was actually proud of him. To me, it meant that he was thinking critically about his Judaism and felt a beard was not necessary or integral to his love and service of God. I agree.</p>
<p>Beards in orthodox Judaism are a funny thing. They mean a lot to some people. But really they mean nothing at all. A beard does not make someone holy. A holy person does not need a beard to be complete. Let&#8217;s not forget that a beard is simply just that, a beard. The Torah prohibits destroying one&#8217;s facial hair. This law is similar to the law prohibiting cutting one&#8217;s self or getting a tattoo. Using a scissor or similar mechanism to trim or shave one&#8217;s beard is not a violation of law or the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>The emphasis placed on things of lesser importance is common in all forms of orthodox Judaism. It can be a harmful force if it causes us to lose sight of what truly is important. If Matisyahu can show non-Jews that being an orthodox Jew is a beautiful life let us hope he can also show orthodox Jews that even a beardless man can live a beautiful life as well.</p>

I hope to publish the sermon in its entirety in the coming days.</em></span></p>
<p>I would like to share with you an important message that strikes me as central to Chanukah and in particular to Chanukah in 2009.</p>
<p>In Friday&#8217;s NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/opinion/11brooks.html?em" target="_blank">David Brooks writes</a> about the Chanukah story. The article is interesting, a bit provocative and very thoughtful. I recommend reading the article in its entirety.</p>
<p>In his words:<span id="more-1840"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Mattathias’s five sons, led by Judah Maccabee, then led an insurgent revolt against the regime. The Jewish civil war raised questions: Who is a Jew? Who gets to define the right level of observance? It also created a spiritual crisis. This was not a battle between tribes. It was a battle between theologies… The lesson of Hanukkah is that even the struggles that saved a people are dappled with tragic irony, complexity and unattractive choices. And he is right and the struggle </em><em>continues today.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Maccabees fought their own Jewish brothers and sisters in an effort to regain control over a Jewish people that were spiraling into assimilation. As Brooks says, in their victory there remains a tragic irony.</p>
<p>Chanukah is a festival that reminds us of the fragmentation within Judaism. Whether it is the ancient epic struggle of Yosef and his brothers or the more current struggles between Jews from along the spectrum of politics, different hometowns in Europe, different Rabbis, different neighborhoods and even between more observant and less observant Jews, unity eludes us.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why the element of <em>pirsumei nisa</em>, of publicizing the grand events of Chanukah is so central to its mitzva. In no other mitzva is there so strong an element of publicizing that the observance of the mitzva depends upon it. How are we to publicize? Is it with bullhorns or billboards? TV ads or  2 page spreads in the NY Times?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It is by lighting candles. It is with fire. It is with light. The light unites us. The light does not play favorites. The light knows no sides. Fire is fire. The way we celebrate the festival of Chanukah is by publicizing a message of light. A universal light. A light that knows no friend or foe. Where there is light, there is light for all. We proclaim the Chanukah story with light. We proclaim a dedication to unity.</p>
<p>This Chanukah let us reunite.</p>
<p><em>We can do it </em>and we have the resources to do it. It is time to set aside differences and unite under the themes and ideals that we agree upon and not look to our differences for fuel towards animosity. Let us look for unity in one another.</p>
<p>If we can do that, it will be a modern day Chanukah miracle.</p>
<p><em>Part of my recent inspiration: (Matisyahu &#8211; One Day). Play the song and listen very carefully to the words.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1638" title="Matisyahu-One_Day" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Matisyahu-One_Day.jpg?resize=240%2C240" alt="Matisyahu-One_Day" data-recalc-dims="1" />I first heard of <a href="http://www.matisyahuworld.com/" target="_blank">Matisyahu</a> while working as a <a href="http://jamoncampus.com" target="_blank">Campus Rabbi</a> at USC. The Jewish students on campus were really into his music (this was ~5 years ago) and some of my students invited me to join them at a Matisyahu concert.</p>
<p>He was performing at the <a href="http://la.knittingfactory.com/" target="_blank">Knitting Factory</a> in Hollywood which was right near my home. I went and it was really cool. The music was great, the message was equally wholesome and the connection that I got to build with my students was profound.</p>
<p>I liked it enough that I took my wife to a Matisyahu show at the <a href="http://www.ajula.edu/" target="_blank">American Jewish University</a> a few weeks later. It was a bad venue for a concert. It was more like a movie theater than the right venue for a reggae concert. Still, we enjoyed the music.</p>
<p>I knew that Matisyahu had made it, when<span id="more-1635"></span> I was listening to my then favorite sports radio show, &#8220;<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2009/01/loose-cannons.html" target="_blank">The Loose Canons</a>&#8221; on AM 570 in Los Angeles (oh how I miss those guys&#8230;) and they played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO3ca5FshCY" target="_blank">Chop &#8217;em Down</a> as their bumper music. That was an epiphany for me. At that point, Matisyahu has &#8220;made it&#8221; in my books.</p>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t sufficient proof that Matisyahu had &#8220;made it&#8221;, I received another clue a few weeks ago. I was playing the <a href="http://2ksports.com/games/nba2k10" target="_blank">NBA 2K10</a> video game and the background music was&#8230; Matisyahu!</p>
<p>I found a video of the NBA 2K10 playlist so you can see for yourself.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="634" height="502" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_c76U_Eenhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="634" height="502" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_c76U_Eenhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>I thought that was pretty cool.</p>
<p>But today around the blogosphere and on Twitter the latest Matisyahu news is regarding the new NBC advertisement for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>This is, by far, the best exposure that Matisyahu has seen in the public eye. The commercial is perfect. The content, the timing of the cuts, the slow &#8211; motion, the music and the message are woven together to create a really perfect ad. The emotion that the 30 second spot exudes are exactly what NBC wants you to feel.</p>
<p>I like NBC as a network and I hope that they can mount a comeback and become relevant again. This ad is a great start.</p>
<p>I am sure Matisyahu is proud to be part of such a great ad. I am proud to share it with you.<br />
