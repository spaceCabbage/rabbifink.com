Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</address>
<h2>Parshas Vayeitzei</h2>
<h2>Vayishma Yaakov!</h2>
<p>After more than 20 years in Lavan’s home, Yaakov Avinu overhears his cousins, (Lavan’s children) speaking despairingly of him. We are told “Vayar Yaakov es pnei Lavan v’henei ainenu emanu imo kismol shilshom” &#8211; and Yaakov saw that Lavan’s face wasn’t the same as it was the day before. What was it that Yaakov saw? In truth, upon learning of his true standing in the house of Lavan, Yaakov introspected. He reexamined his relationship with his uncle and realized it was one sided. He reassessed his life in Golus away from Eretz Yisrael and away from his parents. He realized he didn’t really belong. Something was amiss. Hashem Yisborach had not spoken with him for over twenty years. It was time for a change.<span id="more-3283"></span></p>
<p>Comes the next Posuk: “Vayomer Hashem El Yaakov Shuv El Eretz Avosecha Ul’moladtecha” &#8211; Hashem says to Yaakov, “Return to the land of your fathers and your birthright”. What happened? Why is it that Hashem Yisborach finally speaks to Yaakov Avinu again, in the very next posuk?</p>
<p>The answer is obvious and insightful. Until Yaakov Avinu recognized that something was wrong, Hakadosh Boruch Hu could not help him make it right. Once Yaakov understood the realities of raising his children in Golus he longed for his true home in Eretz Yisroel. He was then blessed with Geulah, as Hashem spoke to him and directed his return.</p>
<p>This maxim is true in both Ruchniyus and Gashmiyus. The first step to correcting any problem is recognizing it. Once one identifies the issues, steps can be taken to go and improve. Indeed, in dealing with the challenges of rearing our children, educating them for success and building their self-esteem we must take honest stock of their strengths and weaknesses. Then we must look at ourselves and the environment we provide to nurture these goals. If we are honest in our assessment, we can create a game plan for advancement and our children will IY”H thrive.</p>
<p>As soon as Yaakov Avinu realized the risk of further remaining in the Golus of Lavan’s home, he was blessed to merit redemption with his return to Eretz Yisroel. “Maasei Avos Siman LaBanim”: May we, too, be blessed to sense the urgency and danger of our long Golus and our need to reconnect spiritually so that we may strive to merit the brachos of Geulah, bimahara biyameinu, amen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Supreme-Court1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2269" title="Supreme-Court" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Supreme-Court-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /></a>A few weeks ago my brother-in-law asked me which branch of government I thought was the most powerful. I immediately answered, &#8220;Legislative&#8221;. He was surprised. As a fellow law student we read case after case where the Supreme Court overturned laws that it felt were unconstitutional. While that is true, it requires Herculean effort for the Supreme Court to overturn a law. The legislature can just write a new law whenever they want. That gives them almost all the power.</p>
<p>It has long been my feeling that legislatures are the best place to effect change in laws. Citizens can petition their law makers to make laws that they want and of they don&#8217;t make law that their constituents like, they can vote someone who will into office. Is this a slow process? Sure. But the Supreme Court process is even slower and the chance that your case will be heard is slim.</p>
<p>There is a second issue when the Judicial Branch speaks from &#8220;on-high&#8221; and mandates a change in law.<span id="more-2267"></span> This was illustrated to me by my supervising research attorney at the California Court of Appeals. He agreed with me that the Legislative Branch is most powerful. He added that sometimes a Supreme Court opinion can have the reverse effect that it intends. For example, in Roe v. Wade, the court held that laws banning / highly regulating abortion in the first trimester were unconstitutional. The reaction from the strident voice of opposition was not the acquiesce and lay low. In fact, it had the opposite affect. Millions and millions of dollars were poured into &#8220;overturning Roe&#8221;. This went on for decades. Interest groups spent all their energy trying to get Roe reversed. But if Roe had not sued in the Supreme Court or if the Supreme Court had denied to see hear Roe, it is very likely that the legislatures would have come around to see the law the way the Supreme Court saw it. In other words, if all the money and time and energy of the Supreme Court case had been spent on activism and PR in favor of looser abortion restrictions, it would have happened organically. And the reaction would not have been so severe.</p>
<p>Sometimes the people are not ready for the ruling of the Supreme Court. Sometime they need time to adjust their old views and in time, they will get it right. This is one of the main reasons there has been weak attempts to take the issue of same sex marriage to the Supreme Court. Even if the Supreme Court rules in their favor, a huge backlash is predicted. This would wind up having the opposite of the intended effect. Time, energy and money would be spent on &#8220;overturning&#8221; the decision. It is wiser to just wait until the people are willing to give them the rights they desire. (Of course this assumes this is bound to happen. As I wrote a while back in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/03/human-beings-are-social-beings/">Human Beings Are Social Beings</a>, more and more people know gay individuals and couples, it is going to be harder and harder to look them in the eye and say &#8220;no rights for you&#8221;. So I am pretty sure it will probably happen eventually.)</p>
<p>Another perfect example of change having the opposite of its desired effect is in the area of Health Care Reform. President Obama and almost all the Democrats want to regulate Health Care. They promise that rates will drop, insurance companies will be forced to be fairer and less discriminatory and everything will be wonderful. As I am self-insured, the new laws may actually help me, but probably not before I get a job with medical benefits.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the proposed bill is having the OPPOSITE effect. My health care premiums went up by 30% a couple months ago. My coverage is the same. My plan is the same. I just pay way more. The NY Times even had a write-up on MY insurance company. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/opinion/19fri1.html?scp=1&amp;sq=anthem%20blue%20cross&amp;st=cse">Editorial &#8211; The Lesson of California&#8217;s Anthem Blue Cross on Health &#8230;</a>) Sometimes, when change is forced down people&#8217;s throats, the effect is the opposite of what is intended. HCR may be wonderful, but in the meantime, it is squeezing millions of self-insured folks as they wait&#8230;</p>
<p>So how does change happen? It is best for it to happen organically. It is best for things to evolve, change slowly without huge monumental changes from &#8220;on-high&#8221;.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a story I read once:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The sun and the wind were having a contest to see you could get the man to remove his coat. The wind blew hard and the man clutched his coat tighter. The wind blew even harder and the man redoubled his efforts to hold his coat. The sun shone bright and the man got warm and took his coat off on his own.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>(Where are we going with this? You&#8217;ll see soon.)</p>

<p>It has been a while since I posted a video of Ozzie. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/11/take-a-smile-break-another-cute-baby-post/" target="_blank">The last video showed him crawling to his toys</a>. That was 4 months ago and boy how things have changed since then.</p>
<p>Even more has changed since I posted the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/21/i-could-not-help-myself/" target="_blank">first video of Ozzie playing a game</a>.</p>
<p>Babies change every day. They learn new things every day. We can learn a lot from babies.</p>
<p>Especially at this time of year as we attempt to make changes in our lives. Sometimes it is hard to make change, I think it can be helpful to observe others who are succesful at learning to behaviors and attitudes. Babies definitely change drastically from day to day and month to month and year to year.</p>
<p>As adults we need to &#8220;re-learn&#8221; how to change. We need to be more like babies to a certain extent. <span id="more-1329"></span>We must be hungry for knowledge, quick to change and ready to adapt.</p>
<p>Ozzie understands a lot of words and can respond accordingly. In this video he is asked to &#8220;Bang&#8221; and he does so very well. Ozzie also says his first word. Incredibly it is the same first word that Rami said, &#8220;Uh-Oh&#8221;. He says it when things fall. In fact he said it recently and we thought he was kidding, but later we realized that he was right, we had dropped something&#8230;</p>
<p>Sometimes kids know best!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1145" title="9/11 memorial" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/3362543427_cfc43cb647-300x200.jpg" alt="9/11 memorial" width="300" height="200" />It has been eight years since that fateful day.</p>
<p>9/11/01</p>
<p>Much has changed in the world since then and much has changed in my life. I got married. I have two sons. I am a Rabbi. I am a Law Student. I am a blogger.</p>
<p>For me, 9/11 was a signpost along the way. My last few months of bachelorhood were marked by the aftermath of 9/11.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to that day.<span id="more-1143"></span></p>
<p>I had the flu and was stuck in bed. I got up late and hobbled to the bathroom. Some guy says to me &#8220;they got the second tower&#8221;, I had no idea what he was talking about. I overheard someone say to turn on the radio. When I turned on the radio my heart dropped.</p>
<p>For my friends and I, studying at Yeshiva of Far Rockaway, we were so close to Ground Zero we could see smoke from our dorm.</p>
<p>The pain of the thousands of victims was felt by an entire nation. We connected with each other in a way that only war can unite people. We were united by a common enemy but we picked each other up in every way possible. It went beyond 9/11 and it became about being human. Eventually, humans will cease to get along, but it sure was nice while it lasted.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most emotional part of the entire 9/11 attack and recovery was the camaraderie that it created. I know that I feel a similar camaraderie when I visit Israel. I know everyone there is family. My brothers and sisters surround me when I go to Israel. Post 9/11 New York felt very much the same.</p>
<p>Around that time the band U2 had made a comeback. Their mid to late 90&#8242;s albums all flopped. They returned to their roots with &#8220;All That You Can&#8217;t Leave Behind&#8221; in October 2000. The album had astronomic appeal and was just as popular in September 2001 as it was when it was released a year earlier. The feel of the album was soulful, inspirational rock. It worked.</p>
<p>In October of 2001 U2 had a concert in Madison Square Garden. When u2 sang their Grammy winning song &#8220;Walk On&#8221; they pulled off the most powerful moment I have ever seen on video. The song message is to move on from pain and hurt and to take the lessons of tragedy and difficulty and use them to make our lives better. To &#8220;Walk On&#8221;. With names of all the victims scrolling in the background, U2 called a contingency of NYC Firefighters onto the stage for a heroes welcome.</p>
<p>I am not 100% certain why, but the video makes me cry every time and even as I type this blog post my eyes fill with tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps you will feel the same way. (The first 4:30 is the song, and the FDNY comes on towards the end). Thanks to Bill Simmons aka The Sports Guy for <a href="http://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/3914950307" target="_blank">tweeting the link</a> to this video.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/frC8fno4TfI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/frC8fno4TfI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">I would like to personally thanks those heroes who saved lives and my thoughts are with all those who lost friends and family on that tragic day 8 years ago.</p>
