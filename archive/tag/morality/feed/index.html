				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/the-lighthouse/.premium-1.632217" target="_blank">was a terrible movie</a>, but that won’t stop me from finding some redeeming value in its new interpretation of the Exodus story. I waited for the Torah readings about the Exodus story in our Torah reading cycle to tackle the most thought provoking aspect of the recent film.</p>
<p>The familiar version of the Exodus story includes a litany of harsh punishments levied by God against Pharaoh and the Egyptian people. Their suffering during these plagues is so immense that we have an ancient custom to spill some wine from our of goblets at the Pesach Seder as we recount each plague to demonstrate our sympathy for their pain. Nevertheless, the story is focused on <em>our</em> pain. We eat matzah to recall the bread of affliction that we ate in slavery. We eat maror to relive the bitterness of our servitude. We dip in salt-water to taste the tears of suffering we endured. In our version of the story, we are the good guys, the Egyptians and the Pharaoh are the bad guys, and God is our Secret Weapon.<span id="more-9112"></span></p>
<p>The movie presents a more objective view.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/01/19/why-did-god-punish-all-the-ancient-egyptians/%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%b3/" rel="attachment wp-att-9114"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9114" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/باانس.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> It tells the story with less self-interest than when we tell it, so we are able to see things in the film that we may normally overlook. I believe it’s a huge flaw in its storytelling that viewers of the film empathize more with Ramses II than Moses (see my review linked above), but it also speaks to a greater challenge the movie presents. We get the sense that the Egyptians are also victims of the Pharaoh. They are not innocent parties, but the average citizen can hardly be held accountable to the degree that Joe the Breadmaker must be made to suffer so greatly. In the film, fishermen do not deserve to be eaten by giant crocs. They’ve done nothing wrong. It is excruciating to hear the primal screams of the mothers of the stricken first borns during the final plague. They don’t deserve that either.</p>
<p>The movie is making a decent point. Great suffering and harm must be justified in order to balance the moral scale. How are we to understand Divine collective punishment? It is disconcerting. I thought we were supposed to be the good guys in the Exodus story? Why is our Secret Weapon causing so much unnecessary suffering?! Perhaps more importantly, what are we supposed to think of all this? Is it okay to even ask this question?</p>
<p>There is something that must be done before suggesting answers to this challenge. We need to establish the validity of the question. If you’ve wondered about this, I salute you. This is a question that has to be asked, and the ability to ask this question is a fundamental skill that has infinite value to me. To step back and wonder if the story demands clarification is important and sophisticated. This is not a childish or rebellious question. This is a genuine question that we should all struggle with. Further, the question is sometimes better than the answers available to us.</p>
<p>I can think of four accepted approaches in Orthodox Judaism:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. All of the Egyptians must have deserved it. God does not punish the innocent and if they were punished they must have been guilty. Here you can be creative about their sins. I call this the Ray Lewis approach. <em>“God does not make mistakes.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Some Egyptians deserved it and others were collateral damage. God was punishing the leaders and the oppressors within the Egyptian nation. Once shots are fired, innocents will be harmed. I call this the Hiroshima approach.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Only the guilty Egyptians actually suffered from the plagues. In other words, the descriptions of the plagues are generalizations that seem to include every Egyptian. The truth is that only a small number of leaders and oppressors were punished, and their experience is described in the Torah. The innocent were not harmed; only a few guilty parties felt the terror of the plagues, and the rest of Egypt watched in horror. I call this the Selective Anecdote Becoming History approach.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Some argue that collective punishment is moral. Handwringing over death to Egyptians is a corrupt symptom of modernity and we need not think twice about innocent victims. There’s no problem here in the first place. I call this the Old-School Morality approach. <em>“Woe to the wicked person. Woe to his neighbor.”</em></p>
<p>It’s also possible that an indirectly related novel idea I posted on Facebook before Parshat Va’era might reduce some of our anxiety about innocent Egyptians dying.</p>

</div>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Finally, I think there might something else worth exploring. The question we are asking is certainly built on modern sensibilities. I don’t think the ancients were bothered by such concerns. (I could be wrong.) Just a few years earlier, the Pharaoh had decreed that all Israelite males be killed for population control purposes. Clearly, we are dealing with a society that is at odds with our views of morality.</p>
<p><em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> superimposed modern morality on an ancient civilization. It’s not a perfect fit, and the act of forcing them to work together creates collateral damage to the narrative. Judging the way God deals with an ancient civilization with objectionable moral standards using our progressive modern standards of morality is worse than someone who only understands English judging Ugaritic poetry. It’s impossible to do, and if one tries, it demonstrates a lack of maturity.</p>
<p>I don’t think we have to think that God would do the same thing as God did in ancient Egypt. God does not conjure supernatural miracles to punish entire peoples anymore. Meanwhile, the world has changed. The way God interacts with the world could be reflective of the way we act toward each other. Thus, it’s not a problem for me if God’s actions toward an ancient civilization do not square with modern moral standards. I wouldn’t expect otherwise.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we should not even think about this sort of question. On the contrary, we must ask these questions and discuss the various options. The inquiry is more important than the conclusion, and should be encouraged. <em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> helped me think about the Exodus in a new way. It invited new questions and new questions invite new discussions and new discussion invite new answers.</p>
<p>This is beauty. This is Torah. This is where we experience the beauty of Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/shmuly-yanklowitz-why-this-rabbi-is-swearing-off-kosher-meat-1401404939" target="_blank">opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal</a>, the world read that Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz &#8220;cannot pretend anymore that kosher meat, poultry and dairy is any healthier or ethical than nonkosher food.&#8221; Long before Rabbi Shmuly wrote this article in the WSJ he was a vegetarian. Nothing has actually changed in his eating habits as a result of this epiphany but it&#8217;s still interesting to hear what he has learned over the years. I guess.</p>
<p>The problem with this article is not that it airs dirty laundry in public or that some of the facts about slaughter are imprecise. Those are allegations that have been made, but there is a much more severe problem with the article. Why did Rabbi Shmuly ever pretend that kosher meat, poultry and dairy is any healthier or ethical than non kosher food in the first place?<span id="more-8471"></span></p>
<p>We have no idea why the Torah commands us to observe the laws of kashrut. Any attempt to assign specific reasons to the mitzvot in the Torah is pure speculation. The Sefer HaChinuch famously provides moral and religious lessons for each commandment. But in his introduction he makes certain that the reader knows that his ideas are just suggestions to make Torah life more meaningful. He is not stating that these are the reasons God commanded us to observe these laws. <img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Ethics-Graphic.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Ethics Graphic" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8473" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Further, several reasons are provided for keeping kosher and nothing have any relationship to ethics and a small minority connect kashrut to physical health. The most common thread between the various opinions of the speculative benefits of keeping kosher is spiritual health, not physical health. But none of the interpretations I have seen say anything about ethics.</p>
<p>Whoever taught Rabbi Shmuly that kosher had anything to do with ethics made a severe error. Not only did one person find this teaching hypocritical, but this caused that person to publicized this teaching as if it were truth and then demonstrated that Orthodox Jews are not keeping kashrut properly because there are ethical concerns. Truly unfortunate.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know why we keep kashrut. Teaching one reason as the reason can yield dastardly results. Outreach organizations need to be so careful with the way they teach the moral lessons of Torah. I&#8217;ve heard too many anecdotes of well intentioned people creating serious problems for their students later on in their lives. Unless the Torah tells us why we were given a mitzvah, we cannot say with confidence that we know what the objective is for any mitzvah. Every time we speak of the rationale or benefit of mitzvot, we are in the area of art, not science. It&#8217;s philosophy, not law. It&#8217;s conjecture, not dogma.</p>
<p>When it comes to kashrut, there are plenty of wonderful lessons to be learned. There may even be lessons about ethics. But food that is prepared unethically is still legally kosher. There is no law that states otherwise. Kashrut is binary. It either is, or it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>However, the Torah does demand that we treat animals with kindness and respect. Animal cruelty may not render something nonkosher, but it still violates a severe prohibition in the Torah. Are kosher slaughterhouses possibly playing with fire? Absolutely. They have an obligation to treat the animals well and we are responsible to apply the social pressure so that they will conform. But the food is kosher even if they treat the animals poorly as long as they do not render the animal legally nonkosher.</p>
<p>The Torah and the Prophets exhort us to act ethically and morally even when the other laws of the Torah are not being violated. Nachmanides even has a moniker for one who keeps the laws of the Torah but acts unethically and immorally. One is called a <em>&#8220;naval b&#8217;rshut haTorah&#8221;</em> &#8211; &#8220;a depraved person who acts within Torah law.&#8221; It&#8217;s possible to be such a person. But that does not make it right. It&#8217;s possible to provide unethical kosher food, that does not make it right, but the food is still kosher. One has nothing to do with the other.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the Agunah problem. People are often outraged that the Torah &#8220;allows&#8221; a recalcitrant husband to harm his estranged wife by withholding the get. As I remarked <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/07/answering-the-most-difficult-question-about-the-agunah-crisis/" target="_blank">in a previous article</a>, the Torah does not allow that at all. The Torah merely does not make it part of divorce law. But a Torah abiding Jew is required to be a kind and moral person at all times. Withholding a get violates several other laws in the Torah. According to divorce law the husband can be a jerk. But according to Torah law, he may not.</p>
<p>We have mitzvot and verses like:</p>
<p>&#8220;Love your neighbor like yourself.&#8221; &#8211; Lev. 19:17<br />
&#8220;Do not oppress a stranger.&#8221; &#8211; Ex. 23:9<br />
&#8220;Justice justice you shall pursue.&#8221; &#8211; Deut. 16:20</p>
<p>And the collection of prohibitions and laws against Tzaar Baalei Chaim &#8211; causing pain to living beings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that we are precise with our explanations of Torah, mitzvot, and Jewish law. Kashrut and divorce law only inform us of the procedures and obligations specific to their areas of law. But that does not mean we are permitted to forget about the moral and ethical admonitions found throughout the rest of our law and tradition. The laws of the Torah work together to cultivate a good, moral society. But each commandment is not independently ethical or moral. There is a system and all the parts play a role. We are miserable failures if the Torah life we teach opens the door for <em>&#8220;naval b&#8217;rshut haTorah&#8221;</em>. We can do better and we should demand better. But it&#8217;s not because of the laws of kashrut or divorce. It&#8217;s because that&#8217;s what the Torah and the Prophets demand from us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ongoing conversation about the agunah problem in the wake of the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/05/the-ny-post-agunah-story-is-about-much-more-than-jewish-divorce/" target="_blank">Gital Dodelson article in the NY Post</a> consistently raises one impossibly difficult question. I’ve been asked this question many times and in many different ways. In my opinion, it’s the fundamental issue of the agunah crisis.</p>
<p>The public is justifiably angry with a husband who does not give a get. But the recalcitrant husband has a pretty compelling argument in his favor.<span id="more-7805"></span></p>
<p>The Torah itself gives the husband absolute authority in the matter of the divorce. If this is Torah law then we are forced to say that this is God’s will. If God gave the power of divorce to the man alone, how can it be considered wrong or evil if he does not give his wife a get? And how can we call it an injustice when he does not give a get? Don’t blame the husband, blame the Torah. The Torah is at fault. God is at fault. Change the laws of divorce and the problem will be solved!</p>
<p>Some variant of this question is the crux of the agunah problem. In simple terms, why is the husband a bad guy when he doesn’t give a get if God gave him the power to decide if he wants to give the get? It is a very difficult question for an Orthodox Jew. And now it is being asked over and over again.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-9564591.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7807" alt="large-9564591" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-9564591.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I think I have an answer to this question.</p>
<p>It’s true that in terms of divorce law, the power to divorce vests in the husband and he is the only one who can dissolve a marriage. The husband must willingly give the get. We are stuck with that law. Pure legalistic Torah matters are almost always unassailable. There is almost no way for contemporary rabbinic authorities to change a law derived from the Torah or even established by Chazal. There’s just no acceptable mechanism within Orthodox Judaism to make changes to Torah law.</p>
<p><em>(Rabbinic laws often have loopholes baked into the law, e.g. eruvei chatzeros, eruv tavshilin. Pruzbul and hefker beis din hefker are examples of the rabbis creating a legal fiction that circumvents Torah laws with regard to money, they do not change the actual Torah laws.)</em></p>
<p>The thing is, divorce law is not the only part of the Torah that informs us how to behave in case of divorce. That part of the Torah is will never change. There are other parts of the Torah that do fluctuate and are subject to societal norms and niceties. Ethical and moral laws in the Torah depend on the context. Kindness and virtue largely depend on the subjective expectations of one’s friends and community. Perhaps at one time a certain act or behavior was considered normal and fair. But at a different time it could be considered evil or wrong. Things in this arena are more subjective and they do change. These <em>bein adam l’chaveiro</em> elements of the Torah always apply and I think they are especially important during a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> One is obligated to love his fellow as himself. “That which is hated to you, do not do to others.” Would a husband want his wife to hold him hostage? No. Thus it is prohibited to hold the wife hostage.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> It is prohibited to cause an animal pain. All the more so it is prohibited to cause pain to a fellow human being. Withholding a get causes extreme pain to the estranged wife.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> One who causes emotional damage to another person is obligated to compensate the victim. One cannot act in a way that causes other emotional harm. R’ Elyashiv <em>paskened</em> that sexual abusers were <em>rodfim</em> (pursuers) because of the emotional harm caused by their violence toward their victims. Causing another person emotional harm is a very serious issue and is absolutely against the Torah.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The Torah requires that we help unload the animal of our enemy. Many authorities learn from this that we are required to lend a helping hand to anyone who requires help. Does a wife waiting for her get not require assistance?<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> We are obligated to follow in the merciful ways of God. Is it merciful to withhold a get? Clearly not. A recalcitrant husband violates this mitzvah as well.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Read the prophets. Their words often constitute rabbinic obligations. They admonish us for mistreating the underprivileged. A wife at the mercy of her husband is underprivileged.</p>
<p>The list goes on. There are many interpersonal obligations and prohibitions that are blatantly trampled upon when one withholds a get. I don’t think there is an doubt about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the objective laws of divorce won’t ever change. But the subjective laws of how to treat one’s wife during a divorce are subject to change. Maybe at one time it was not evil to withhold a get. I don&#8217;t understand it, but I accept that it may have been normative behavior at one time in history. But our common sense tells us that today it is amoral to cause this kind of pain to anyone, let alone one’s wife.</p>
<p>Turns out that while the Jewish laws of divorce don’t obligate the husband to give a get and a wife really cannot divorce her husband, by refusing to give a get the husband is violating several other mitzvahs. In other words, if one isolates the get issue as a pure question of Jewish divorce law it’s true that the wife is powerless and seemingly unprotected. But the Torah is not so simple. We don’t isolate civil law from religious law and we don’t sequester civil and religious law from the Torah’s moral and ethical laws. It’s all part of one Torah given by one God. Exploiting a legal loophole does not justify violating ethical laws in the Torah. It’s forbidden to be a jerk. It’s an <em>issur d’orysa</em> in many instances. It does not matter that the Torah gives him the right to be a jerk. It’s still assur.</p>
<p>I think that the original question obfuscates just how terrible it is to withhold a get. It is so obviously a horrible way to act towards a fellow human being. Regardless of whether it is within the husband’s legal right to withhold the get, it is patently clear that by refusing to give a get a husband is in violation of the ethical and moral laws as well as the spirit of the Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/busy-brain.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4577" title="busy-brain" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/busy-brain.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A little while back, the NY Times Magazine published a fascinating article that I think everyone should read.</p>
<p>The article is based on several comprehensive studies about decision making. People make many decisions each day; the data shows that decision making can wear a person down. Not physically as much as mentally.</p>
<p>It turns out that our brains do have something akin to will power and it can be drained and replenished. The studies show that when people are forced to make a multitude of decisions during the course of a day their decision making power can become so markedly diminished that they are to mentally weak to make any more decisions. Instead people will defer or worse, acquiesce to others and allow them to make their decisions for them.</p>
<p>Clearly, this has broad ramifications across the entire spectrum of people and situations.<span id="more-4576"></span> In one study, parolees had a much greater chance of being granted parole if their case was heard early in the day or session. This factor was more decisive than length of sentence or severity of crime in determining whether parole was granted.</p>
<p>Socially, poor people are often criticized for their bad decision making. The proverbial &#8220;buying candy with food stamps&#8221; can also be understood using this data. For middle class and wealthy people, food shopping is not decision intensive. The choices are relatively harmless and don&#8217;t carry much weight. But for people living on a tight budget, each item is an agonizing choice that slowly but surely drains their will power. Eventually, the brain is too tired to make sound choices and impulse buys become too difficult to resist.</p>
<p>There is a strong correlation between the number of significant choices one makes and one&#8217;s general will power. This is one reason dieting is so difficult. After making all the right food choices throughout the day, the brain can become weakened to the point that it cannot withstand the temptation to indulge in &#8220;bad foods&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of the studies is the Mardi Gras Principle. The idea that one can increase will power by indulging before a period of self control is a common one. The data says it works, but only kind of works. Other things are equally effective in boosting self control. Indulgence cannot be excused simply because of subsequent self control.</p>
<p>Jewish philosophy intersects with some of the issues raised in the article. For one, in Judaism one is defined by their choices. Our moral choices is what makes us or breaks us. Since this is so, it is very important that we set ourselves up for success and help ourselves to make the right choices. One needs a strategy to make good choices. The article provides this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;people with the best self-control are the ones who structure their lives so as to conserve willpower. They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it’s available for emergencies and important decisions.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>I agree with all the above. In addition, I think Judaism believes that the self control and decision making abilities we possess can be strengthened through hard work like any other physical capacity. Practice makes <del>perfect</del> better. Judaism helps one to be on the alert for decisions and not allow our brains to cop out and defer or decide poorly. We are to be conscious of our decision making at all times and it is supposed that by working on one&#8217;s self to make good, positive conscious decisions, one will strengthen their decision making prowess and avoid the problems created by decision fatigue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scales-of-justice-legal-aid-toronto-gta-canada.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4235" title="scales-of-justice" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scales-of-justice-legal-aid-toronto-gta-canada.jpg?resize=245%2C299" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>One of the confusing things about the Bible is the different names attributed to God. To Bible critics this is an indication that more than one God or more than one version of God or simply more than one author is present in the Bible.</p>
<p>Talmudic Judaism has a different approach. God, the One God, has more than one name (see yesterday&#8217;s Rambam class: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/15/rambam-class-51511/">Rambam Class 5/15/11</a>). Since God is infinite and cannot be limited to one &#8220;mood&#8221; or &#8220;characteristic&#8221; therefore different names are used when God is Acting in a specific way. That specific way cannot define God because it would limit God. Instead, the Torah uses different names to identify the character of God in that Act, commandment, prophecy. The Ineffable name of God, יהוה, refers to God&#8217;s mercy. The other commonly found name in the Bible is אלוהים. This name refers to God&#8217;s precise Judgment.</p>
<p>The two Names play off each other. Without mercy, the judgment would be too harsh and without the judgment, the mercy would be too forgiving. There is a balance. A Perfect balance.</p>
<p>God is both our Father and our King. God loves us and we are expected to love God back. God also metes out punishment and we are expected to fear God.</p>
<p>This is all very nice, but why talk it about it today?<span id="more-4232"></span></p>
<p>Because of  a (fairly) recent article in LA Times.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago the LA Times reported on a study that determined the willingness of diffferent kinds of people to cheat on a test. Three very interesting things arose from the peer reviewed and published study.</p>
<p>First, that there is no difference between the ethical behavior of atheists and believers. This is surprising to believers because there is a lot of rhetoric directed against non-believers. The rhetoric often claims that non-believers prefer not to believe to give them license to act immorally. After all, if there is no God, why act morally? This study debunks that assumption. There is a better, more precise argument about the difference between the morality of atheists and believers. That is, the believer&#8217;s source of morality is a Creator. The Creator can better establish the baseline of morality than humans. An atheist&#8217;s version of morality is subject to the ideas of flawed people. (Of course the counter argument is that the word of God is subject to interpretation. To which the counter to that counter is that the interpretations of a specific religious sect are claimed to be Divine as well. And so on and so one&#8230;)</p>
<p>The second was that 95% of americans believe in God. Which does skew the perception that God is losing and falling out of the collective american soul. But those 95% have many very different views of God. Some believe God is very involved in the daily lives of humans and others believe God created the world and took a vacation. Others believe that God will render judgment in the afterlife and others do not. The point is that while 95% agree God exists, who that God is, is still very much in debate. But also, I believe the significantly smaller sample size of atheists does affect the results of the this study in some way. I am just not certain how.</p>
<p>The third, even more interesting part of the study demonstrated that there is a difference in the ethical decisions of believers in a punitive God and belief in a compassionate God. Turns out that believers in a punitive God were less likely to cheat than believers in a compassionate God. At first glance, this is not surprising. But it is discouraging. It seems to me that the believers in a compassionate God are able to excuse unethical behavior on account of the belief that God will forgive their sins. Even if God does forgive their sins, isn&#8217;t it important to be honest and moral anyway? I believe it is.</p>
<p>Talmudic Judaism accounts for both of these versions of God. We believe that God is compassionate and God is perfectly just. There exists a balance and perhaps this would serve as a correction for those who focus on the compassion of God. This balance is important and upsetting the balance appaers to threaten to affect the morality of believers.</p>
<p>To me, this study affirms the wisdom of the Torah and Talmudic tradition by including both of these aspects of God and not the exclusion of the other.</p>

(See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/19/is-a-ban-on-circumcision-constitutional-probably-not/">Is a Ban on Circumcision Constitutional? Probably Not</a>.) Plus there was more on Twitter&#8230;</p>
<p>The previous post was about the legality of such a ban. That is an important question.</p>
<p>An important question has been volleyed back to those who want parents to have the choice to circumcise their sons without government interference.</p>
<p><em>How is it moral to perform elective surgery on a non-consenting child? If the child wants a circumcision later, then they can get it on their own. What right does a parent have to force a circumcision on their innocent child?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fair question. I have no gripes with the question.</p>
<p>But there is an answer. A return volley.<span id="more-3321"></span></p>
<p>Orthodox Jews follow the commandments of the Torah (Old Testament) and the Oral Tradition of how to keep those commandments. The Torah commands us to circumcise our sons when they are 8 days old. Nearly every single child born to an Orthodox Jewish family will grow up to be an Orthodox Jew as well. The percentages are very high. Sure, some people venture off, but even those folks are likely to keep some basic traditions like circumcision.</p>
<p>So, the kid is going to grow up to be an Orthodox Jew. The kid is going to be obligated to have a circumcision and he is going to want fulfill that obligation. It almost guaranteed that the kid will want a circumcision.</p>
<p>Turns out, the parents are doing the kid a favor. The kid wants the circumcision. It is not something that the kid might or might not choose later on. It is a fait accompli.</p>
<p>Intactivists need to realize that the circumcision is not a &#8220;choice&#8221; like favorite sports team. A circumcision is something that the child is required to do and will accept that obligation as they grow older.</p>
<p>In other words, it is not an elective surgery foisted upon an unsuspecting youth who is likely to regret or will even possibly regret the procedure, thus rendering it barbaric. Under those circumstances, it is not barbaric.</p>
<p><em>(If you are someone who grew up as an Orthodox Jew and will not circumcise your kids or regret that you have been circumcised, please email me or comment below. I am interested for information gathering purposes.)</em></p>

<h2>Avram&#8217;s Journey</h2>
<h2>Lech Lecha 2009</h2>
<p>The Torah begins the story of our forefather Avraham in this week’s parsha. Thus begins the story of the Jewish people. The first Jew begins his journey in Lech Lecha and that journey defines us for all time. We still feel the effects of that journey. The better we can understand and appreciate that journey, the better we can understand and appreciate ourselves and our personal journey.</p>
<p>God commands Avram (not yet named Avraham) to go. “Lech Lecha” means to go. If we analyze the Torah’s words there is more than meets the eye. The Torah says that GD commands Avram: “Go from your land, from your birthplace and from your father’s home.” If all the Torah wanted us to know was that Hashem had commanded Avram to leave or to go, it would have been sufficient to say “lech” or “tzei” – go.<span id="more-3101"></span> Further, the entire section that mentions leaving his land, birthplace and home is superfluous. And it is in the wrong order! First one leaves one’s home, then one’s birthplace or city, and only then does one leave his land or country.</p>
<p>R’ Hirsch says that the word lech comes from the word halach. And that word is related to Chelek, divided and chalak which means smooth, a surface to which nothing adheres. So halach means to go but it connotes separation as well. Sometimes one can separate for the purpose of going to another place, but in this case, the separating was lecha – for Avram’s self.</p>
<p>Avram is separating from three things: Eretz / country, moledes / hometown, and bayis / home. R’ Hirsch says that these three things form the foundation for one’s personality and true essence. Eretz, the country or nationality with all its moral implications. Eretz is like eres – married.  Eres also means cradle. In comparison to  shamayim (heaven) which is sham (over there), the land, our country gives us our cradle in which we learn our morality. Our land gives us national characteristics and the tremendous power of participation in a nation.</p>
<p>Moledes, birthplace, gives us civic position and independence Even narrower is the bayis, the home where we find our individuality and we grow as unique people.</p>
<p>These Hebrew words make it clear that the Torah values the worth of one’s home and homeland. The Torah is not belittling these concepts by asking Avram to isolate from them. Rather, the Torah is telling us the value of these realms and the greatness of the isolation GD demanded from Avram.</p>
<p>In fact, these demands place Avram in direct conflict with the strongest ideals of his era. Centralism was the prevalent tendency of his age. The feared monarch Nimrod, from whom Avram was running, led the Tower of Babel campaign. That campaign was marked by the slogan of “naaseh lanu shem” – we can make ourselves a name. The tower was to represent the community in general for the glory of mankind. This tendency begot an erroneous conception of a majority which has sway in every direction and every case. And eventually, what is honored by the majority ipso facto becomes the thing that is honored by everybody.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that the majority opinion should be well represented in the community and it should represent that which is highest and holiest by everybody. And in Judaism we would expect the same. Still at the very start of the Jewish journey we are taught: Lech Lecha, go for yourself. Stand on your own, separated from the crowd. No one should limit him or herself to the majority. You cannot be only as honest as everybody else, or as moral as everybody else. We must rise above the majority.</p>
<p>Each person is responsible to GD for himself and if necessary to be alone with GD if he can find no partners with whom to worship. This is what GD demanded from Avram at the start of his journey and the start of our collective journey. The beautiful insights into Hebrew language show us how important eretz, molad and bayis are to us and lech lecha tells us that they are only trumped by the bond that attaches us to GD.</p>
<p>There are always those who say that Judaism should be current and up to date with modern ideals. There are some modern ideals that are consistent with Torah; perhaps social conventions caused them to be ignored until they became prevalent in a modern world. We should and must celebrate those ideals. But, Avram’s first stand was not in accordance with the ancient cultures with whom he lived. While the whole world sought every effort to establish themselves; as civilizations became more complex, Avram was giving up his citizenship and his homeland. He protested the idol worship of the other nations. He separated from it all.</p>
<p>Avram was appointed the first Jew, but he had to prove himself first. He had to prove that he could rise up above the fray and be separate. Avram showed us by example.</p>
<p>Our country, our city, our homes all represent inertia. When we revert to the comfort of habits, customs, and thoughts that we are accustomed to, we are relying too heavily on our cradle that we were raised in. We often fail to move forward because of fear or doubt. Hashem tells Avram, Lech Lecha, do what is right. Do what you know you must do to ensure that you will be separate, that you will be elevated and above the customs and traditions into which you were born.</p>
<p>The lesson of lech lecha is that we must act with conviction and that we must act with a trust and hope for future. Avram could have been reluctant to leave all that he left behind. After all one’s country, hometown and home cane be good values, our core values in fact. But sometimes we need to rise above our complacency and elevate ourselves to heights that can only come when we act with the conviction of lech lecha and we make a substantial break from our inertia and instead act in a way that will bond even more strongly with our families, our neighborhoods, our homelands and above all with GD</p>
<p>In our lives we are called upon to make that same choice so many times. What are my priorities? What is the deciding factor in my decisions?</p>
<p>Avram was also faced with tough choices. How did he respond? What was GD’s call to him? Choose GD, above all. Choose spirituality and Torah above all.</p>
<p>Lech Lecha tells us that our homeland, our city and our homes are all important. They all have tremendous value, but ultimately the choice that is right is the choice that will bind us closest to GD. The choice that brings us the greatest spiritual growth and opportunity to sanctify the name of GD is the right choice. That is the call of Lech Lecha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1710" title="Electric Chair" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/03ElectricChair.gif?resize=207%2C210" alt="Electric Chair" data-recalc-dims="1" />In the last few months there have been a few death penalty executions. Most notably the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/10/the-d-c-snipers-execution/" target="_blank">D.C. Sniper was executed on November 10, 2009</a>. Since that time I have been thinking about the death penalty. I have discussed it on Twitter and in real life.</p>
<p>The last unit of our Criminal Law course was the Death Penalty. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Levenson" target="_blank">Professor Levenson</a> asked for volunteers to argue for and against the death penal. Normally, I don&#8217;t jump at opportunities like this, I prefer to watch and observe other students try to make coherent arguments in front of their skeptical peers&#8230; Yet, my had shot up. It was almost involuntary. And I found myself on the side representing &#8220;against&#8221; the Death Penalty.</p>
<p>There were three of us and we split duties. I chose to make the moral argument against the death penalty. What follows was my basic argument.<span id="more-1709"></span></p>
<p>In the USA, murder is against the law. One citizen may not take the life of another. This is a good law and is a basic law in any civilized country. The law is based upon our sense of morality. That means that the starting point when thinking about the morality of taking another&#8217;s life is, that it is immoral.</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions. One who fears for his life may defend his life and is justified in killing his would-be murderer. This is called self-defense.</p>
<p>The application of this defense is very specific. There are other defenses or justifications to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder#First_and_second_degree" target="_blank">First Degree Murder</a> but none will serve as a complete defense, they will only mitigate the charge or perhaps affect the sentencing. In other words, taking the life of another is never completely justified unless it to save one&#8217;s own life.</p>
<p>There should be no exception for the government. The State and Federal Governments have a duty to observe the same laws of morality the citizens must observe. The only moral excuse for killing is in self defense. Self defense can only be argued when the danger is imminent. Once a murderer is apprehended and incarcerated there is no self defense excuse. An incarcerated prisoner poses no imminent danger, thus the taking of his or her life is by definition immoral.</p>
<p>We are not bound to punish criminals by the same heinous acts they committed. The law of our country does not hold <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye" target="_blank">lex talionis</a>. We don&#8217;t punish a criminal with the same act he criminally committed. We shudder at the thought of torturing a torturer or raping a rapist or battering a batterer, how could we be so callous about taking the life of a killer.</p>
<p>We have no moral ground to stand on if we take the life of a murderer. Taking the life of a killer simply turns us into murderers.</p>

Our Criminal Law professor is world famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Levenson" target="_blank">Laurie Levenson</a> (<a href="http://news.google.com/news?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=laurie%20levenson&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wn" target="_blank">she is in the news very often</a>). She is an incredible teacher and a very successful practitioner. Studying Criminal Law in her class is a privilege. (Plus, she brings baked goodies for the class and sometimes stops at Schwartz&#8217;s Bakery to get some kosher goodies for the two Kosher observant Jews in the class. Pretty nice!)</p>
<p>After learning the building blocks of Criminal Law we began our unit in homicide.</p>
<p><span id="more-1099"></span>One of the first homicide cases we read was a <a href="http://www.4lawschool.com/anderson.htm" target="_blank">brutal murder of a 10 year old girl</a>. The defendant offered no defense. He undeniably killed her in a brutal fashion, while intoxicated he took a knife to her, stabbing her about 60 times as he chased her around the house. The court decided that he could not get the death penalty.</p>
<p>Why? The court says that brutality of a murder is not a factor in considering whether a murder is in the 1st degree (incurring the death penalty). First degree murder requires &#8220;premeditation&#8221; and that is analyzed by looking at 3 factors. 1) planning 2) motive and 3) manner. In this case, the defendant did not plan, had no motive and the manner was not a methodical way of killing. It was random and unnecessary. The court sentenced him to life in prison and he escaped the death penalty.</p>
<p>Many of my co-students found this very difficult to swallow. Here we have a violent, brutal murder who will not get 1st degree murder. Some of my co-students wanted the murderer brutally killed in retribution.</p>
<p>In Jewish Law, murder and some other capital crimes are punishable by a death penalty. How does one &#8220;qualify&#8221; for the death penalty? A murderer must be warned by two witnesses that his offense will incur the death penalty. He must acknowledge their warning. Then he must commit the murder with 10 seconds. This approach to capital punishment reflects a basic tenet of Judaism.</p>
<p>Judaism is all about moral choices. Therefore, Judaism punishes the murderer who is making a clear, coherent choice. Only with fair warning and a true understanding of one&#8217;s actions are the murderer&#8217;s actions a clear indication of moral choice to commit murder.</p>
<p>In our Law School case, the fellow did not make a conscious choice. The 3 factors that demonstrate premeditation all demonstrate a choice by the murderer. Planning a murder shows that the murder truly understands what he is doing and is choosing his action of murder. Same for motive and manner. We need to see a conscious choice to take a life for murder to be in the 1st degree.</p>
<p>A drunk man who crazily kills for no reason is not a murderer in the 1st degree. He is a sociopath and must be locked up. But to take his life away via the death penalty requires more than just killing another. It requires a moral choice.</p>
<p>Judaism teaches us that our life is made up of little more than the moral choices we make. Our choices are who we are.</p>
<p>Choose wisely.</p>

<p>The topic of mesira is complex.

Aside from teaching law at University of Maryland, Rabbi Breitowitz is a practicing Rabbi in Silver Spring Maryland. When I lived in Baltimore, I heard Rabbi Breitowitz speak on the topic of mesira and I was able to find the same speech online to refresh my memory.</p>
<p>This is my basic understanding of his take on mesira.<span id="more-1000"></span></p>
<p>He mentions three contemporary positions, Reb Moshe Feinstein, the Aruch HaShulchan and Rav Wosner.</p>
<p>He begins with Reb Moshe. Reb Moshe holds that there is a prohibition of mesira when the secular punishment is worse than the Torah&#8217;s punishment. A moser has a halachic status of a rodef, one who is trying to kill another, and must be stopped from his mesira. There are 3 big exceptions. 1) When the person about whom the moser is speaking of is a rodef himself. This is because a person who kills a rodef is not a killer nor is his act of attempting to kill the rodef is not considered a rodef. As an aside, a sexual or physical abuser is considered a halachic rodef and thus there is no prohibition of mesira in those situations. 2) If the moser is preventing a major communal disaster then there is no prohibition. 3) If it one&#8217;s job to inform, then mesira will not apply.</p>
<p>This is the most narrow view of when one is permitted to be moser that Rabbi Breitowitz mentions.</p>
<p>The Aruch Hashulchan says in a footnote to section 318 in Choshen Mishpat that in a benevolent and fair country where there is a justice system that does not unfairly imprison Jews, one is not guilty of mesira by informing the government of a fellow Jew&#8217;s crimes. He continues by saying &#8220;for example in wonderful Czarist Russia&#8221;. There is a question as to the seriousness of this footnote as he could not have possibly meant that Czarist Russia was fair and benevolent. The question is whether the entire footnote has value or if the entire thing was a false gesture of good faith to the Czar. It is not likely that the Aruch Hashulchan would add a deliberately misleading footnote and the reasoning of his footnote stands whether his country was wonderful or not. Thus, the Tzitz Eliezer holds that the Aruch Hashulchan means that wherever there is a &#8220;procedural justice&#8221; there is no mesira.</p>
<p>The third opinion is that of Rav Wosner. His approach integrates the rules of dina d&#8217;malchusa dina with mesira. His reasoning is that when the non-Jews follow the Noachide law of creating a set of laws it becomes a halachic basis for the Jew to obey those laws. Thus, he concludes that it cannot be possible to violate the prohibition of mesira if one is following the laws of their country. Since, he must follow the laws of that country his mesira is not against halacha. This does not mean one is required to be a moser, rather the reporting is not a violation of mesira.</p>
<p>It is necessary to define when dina d&#8217;milchusa dina constitutes to determine when mesira is not prohibited according to Rav Wosner. The Mechaber says that dina d&#8217;malchusa dina is limited to government interests. The Rama disagrees and says that it applies to anything that is designed to promote the well being of society. Most poskim agree with this definition which includes but is not limited to, criminal law, minimum wage laws, environmental laws and child labor laws.</p>
<p>In conclusion, mesira is a term bandied about to protect our own criminals. In reality, it is very difficult to pin down a halachic moser according to the Aruch Hashulchan or Rav Wosner and although it is possible according to Reb Moshe to be a moser it is still unlikely. We need to be honest with ourselves and stop hiding behind archaic halachic terms to justify false ideas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the world witnessed another wonder of our universe, the Solar Eclipse. This eclipse was visible from Southeast Asia and was the longest eclipse in 18 years and will remain the longest for the next 123 years.</p>
<p>The eclipse has long been associated with mythology and supernatural acts. If you are a fan of the TV show, <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/" target="_blank">Heroes</a>, you know what I mean.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iX8d-T09U9BY--80N9QWImFwW2ewD99JN2T01" target="_blank">many Hindus were gripped by fear</a>. According to Hindu  tradition, the eclipse can cause harm to unborn children. Many ancient cultures attached mythological meaning to solar eclipses. Today, we know that the eclipse is part of the solar pattern that is predictable to the second.</p>
<p>What about Judaism? What do we say about the solar eclipse?</p>
<p><span id="more-894"></span>The Talmud in Sukkah (29a) gives us a clue.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>The Rabbis taught: </em><span style="font-weight:normal;"><em>An account of four things the sun is [eclipsed]: An improperly eulogized head of Jewish court, a betrothed girl who is raped and her cries go unheeded, [&#8230;], and two brothers killed on one day.</em></span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">What in the world does this mean?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">Is this more mythology? </span></strong></p>
<p>The 19th Century German Torah Scholar, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Ettlinger" target="_blank">Yaakov Etlinger</a>, writes in his Aruch L&#8217;Ner, that the Talmudic Rabbis certainly knew eclipses were natural phenomena running their course. (He proves this with inferences from within the text which are too tedious and lost in translation to English). It is similar to what Nachmanadies writes with regard to the Biblical promise after the Great Flood that God would not flood the world again, and he sealed the promise with the rainbow. Of course, the rainbow always existed, it is a natural phenomena. Nachmanadies explains that the rainbow is a sign, a reminder to us and in a different sense to God that He made a promise never to destroy His world again.</p>
<p>Simililarly, when a solar eclipse occurs and the light is temporarily removed from the physical world we are reminded of the moral implications of a dark world. A world in which good leaders are quickly forgotten, women are treated as objects and blood is spilled within one family, is a world of darkness.</p>
<p>When we see the eclipse we are to remember that it is our job as human beings to bring light into our world. The light of morality, mindfulness and sensitivity will protect our society from these terrible social ills mentioned in Sukkah. It is important to recognize what a world we would have if there was no moral light. If our world was thrust into spiritual darkness just as the physical world is thrust into sudden solar darkness during an eclipse our world would be quite different. Seeing this occur in the natural world &#8220;enlightens&#8221; us to provide that light and prevent the spiritual darkness from overcoming the light.</p>
<p>I think it is absolutely magnificent to live a life where we find meaning and messages from every part of our lives. A life where each moment makes a difference and each of our choices can change the world.</p>
<p>Equally magnificent is the sheer physical beauty of the solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this post. In appreciation I have provided some of the best footage (seen on NYTimes.com) of last week&#8217;s eclipse. Enjoy it &#8211; you deserve it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those folks who report on and follow Hollywood gossip and news it sure has been a busy week.</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://images.usatoday.com/life/_photos/2006/07/13/mcmahon.jpg" target="_blank">Ed McMahon</a> died, then <a href="http://www.virginmedia.com/images/farra-300x400.jpg" target="_blank">Farrah Fawcett</a> and then <a href="http://www.mjkingofpop.com/images/Mike146.jpg" target="_blank">Michael Jackson</a> (oh, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vUxHZ5EoPg" target="_blank">Billy Mays</a> too). Of course, the death of Michael Jackson garnered the most attention. Michael Jackson completely revolutionized the entire music industry (Jewish and not Jewish music) and made all kinds of news for his questionable extra-curricular activities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=513330776&amp;ref=ts" target="_blank">A friend of mine</a> in the music industry (Jewish and not Jewish music) wrote this on his Facebook page <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;</span><span style="color:#333333;"><em><span style="color:#000000;">Goodbye Michael! We will miss you! You taught me so much&#8230;</span></em><span style="color:#000000;">&#8221; and that got the ball really rolling.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span id="more-815"></span>People responded to his status by referring to his notorious trouble with accusations of impropriety with young children. My friend fired back that yes he was flawed but that takes nothing away from his talent. And they went back and forth for a little while.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="color:#000000;">I am certain that this was not the only such discussion following MJ&#8217;s death. We all grapple with the paradox of a deeply flawed and incredibly talented person.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="color:#000000;">To me, it is really a micro and macrocosm of all of our personal struggles. It is a microcosm because he was just one person and &#8220;we&#8221; are everyone else, but it is also a macrocosm because while his talent was greater than any of ours, his flaws were deeper as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="color:#000000;">The next level of contemplation regarding MJ is whether his flaws nullify his contributions. Or more precisely, can we still appreciate his talent all the while knowing he was so challenged in other areas? Is he a role model? No. Is he immensely talented? Yes.</span></span></p>
<p>Does this sound familiar?</p>
<p>This reminds me of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/" target="_blank">my take on LeBron James and his poor sportsmanship</a>. We need to be sensible enough to differentiate athletic talent, musical talent, or any other talent for that matter and the talented one&#8217;s behavior in other arena of life.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect or care if an athlete or celebrity &#8220;acts out&#8221;. They are not famous for their ability to act morally. They are famous for their talents. That is all I care about when I think about that person. MJ&#8217;s liabilities in one area do not influence my opinion of his other accomplishments and my appreciation of those accomplishments.</p>
<p>If you are nervous about this because he is a &#8220;role model&#8221; my response is that you have categorically poor taste in role models. If you are nervous that children look up to him as a role model, my response it that it is the job of the parents to train their children to choose good role models. MJ was not a good role model but then again he should never be looked to as a role model.</p>
<p>And if your child looks to MJ or LeBron or any other famous person who is not famous for their superior ability at making good moral choices you need to parent them and educate them real role models.</p>
<p>A real role model is a person that we can look towards for inspiration and guidance in our daily challenges. Find those people and cherish them. Even if they <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRsM_rU_80g" target="_blank">can&#8217;t do the moonwalk&#8230;</a></p>
