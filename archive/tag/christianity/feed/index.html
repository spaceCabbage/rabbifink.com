				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pew Research Center released their recent study, and the results paint a bleak picture of our religious future in America. It is clear: God’s poll numbers are down across the board, and especially among Millennials. Immediately, frantic media headlines prophesied the end of religion as we know it.</p>
<p>Is this fate? Are we destined to live in a non-religious world? I don’t think we are doomed, unless we keep doing the same things we are doing now. If we want to reverse the trend, we need to reverse course. Suggesting change in religious circles is often taboo. It reminds me of one of my father’s oft repeated (aren’t they all?) jokes. <em>How many Ultra-Orthodox rabbis does it take to change a lightbulb?</em> [beat] <em>Change?!</em><br />
<span id="more-9356"></span></p>
<p>We believers think God gave us our religions. They are not ours to be tinkered and toyed with on a whim.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/07/13/religion-is-dead-long-live-religion/sf/" rel="attachment wp-att-9357"><img class="alignright wp-image-9357 size-thumbnail" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sf.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="sf" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Thus, many believers exclaim that people are abandoning religion because we have become too flexible, too apologetic, too concerned with popular opinion and trends. Their solution is fundamentalism, as it was for the Puritans after the Renaissance, premillennial dispensationalists after Darwin, and Evangelicals in the 80’s after the sexual revolution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, post-modern fundamentalists are making a fundamental mistake. Most Millennials will never be fundamentalists. Above all, they reject the idea that there is only one universal truth. Where hippies rejected authority on principle, Millennials reject appeals to authority because there is no such thing as an authority of ideas. For my entire lifetime of active learning, I’ve been able to fact check anything asserted by an authority as fact. I have never needed to trust authority or rely on the opinions of one person. Self-guided research, diversity, and subjectivity are native to the Millennial generation.</p>
<p>When presented with fundamentalist ideas, we don’t find the “all or nothing” packages attractive. Some of the ideas that are preached by fundamentalists have merit, but that does not translate into adopting fundamentalism. It did in the 80’s. Evangelical Christianity and the Jewish “returnee” movement were massive movements that took hold in the 80’s, and both remain in their own shadows from that time. More fundamentalism is not the answer. In fact, it&#8217;s part of the problem.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the non-fundamentalist option has been to change. When the rules get tough, change the rules. If some of the theology is at odds with modern ideals, just rewrite it. By drawing a target around the arrow after it is lodged in the tree, liberal religious groups can make participation effortless and guiltless. The appeal of change is that is promises everything, but the reality is that this sort of change completely undermines religion.</p>
<p>Millennials flock to authentic experiences. Burning Man is a perfect example of this.  A Burning Man experience is powerful, unique, and above all, authentic.  Similarly, artisanal foods are quintessentially Millennial. No Millennial is trading fine French cuisine for a Big Mac. We want the real thing. We want meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>A counterfeit religious experience is no religious experience at all. It might keep families together at church and synagogue for a few more years, but without authenticity and engagement, nothing will connect Millennials to the experience. It’s hollow. When the structural shell is removed, nothing remains.</p>
<p>But all is not lost. I think there is an alternative approach that respects tradition, does not compromise authenticity, and works for Millennials. The first part of my proposal is that religion is actually a collection of beliefs and practices which ask us to struggle in the tension they create. There is beauty in tension. Ambiguity and doubt are key ingredients to great art. Poetry, music, theater, visual arts, culinary arts, love, and beauty are all ambiguous. They are all open to interpretation, and they all ask us to insert our struggles into the space they create for creative understanding.</p>
<p>We must stop preaching certainty and begin preaching doubt and struggle. Find beauty in the tension, instead of satisfaction in certainty. Religious leaders must be honest, and publicly acknowledge their own struggles and doubts. Instead of occupying the space of certainty that is anathema to Millennials, religion must occupy the space of subjectivity, ambiguity, and struggle. Religion is not the answer to life’s questions. Religion is the tool for exploring the big questions.</p>
<p>We can tolerate mistakes, difficult challenges, unanswered questions, and tension between tradition and modernity. We will not tolerate platitudes, over-confidence, false bravado, and apologetics. Be honest. Acknowledge the problems. Admit your own struggles. Then, invite the Millennials in your life to join you for an authentic experience of engaging with life’s struggles through the lens of religion. The Biblical heroes were flawed and they struggled. Let’s emphasize those stories and animate those Bible passages in our teachings.</p>
<p>The second part of my proposal is found in the tension between nostalgia and relevance. So much of our religious instruction and experience is nostalgic. We try to recapture something magical from our childhood, or a latent memory from a place and time that tugs at us. Millennials love nostalgia, and it’s a valuable tool when, but religion cannot subsist on nostalgia alone.</p>
<p>Our world is so different from the world of our Biblical heroes. Our lives are virtually nothing like the lives of the centuries of interpreters and teachers of religion. We must continue to lean on the eternal teaching they have bequeathed to us, but their teachings felt contemporary to their direct audiences. When we retell their teachings, they may feel nostalgic at best and irrelevant at worst. We must continue to write and create teachings that resonate with us and tell our story.</p>
<p>The Bible is an incredible canvas. Religious texts offer innumerable opportunities for modern interpretation. Not the kind that strips religion of its precepts, rather, the sort of modern interpretations that bring ancient teachings to life. When we explain our rituals, we must choose explanations that add meaning to our lives today. Take ownership of our religions. We can&#8217;t expect Millennials to be spectators of their religion. Millennials want to participate with mind, spirit, soul, and body. Relevance is key to hooking religion to our lives, and not merely relegating our traditions to museums and mausoleums.</p>
<p>I believe in God. I believe in religion. I believe in Millennials. This is fixable problem. Let’s fix it. Acknowledge our struggles. Live in the tension. Make religion relevant with new and modern interpretation. Live a life infused with religious meaning. When the results of the next Pew report on religion in America are released, we can shock the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best advertised features of the Purim story, as told in Megilat Esther, is the absence of God’s name. In fact, the story is perfectly viable without God playing any role in the tale. Much like our lives, the presence or absence of God is impossible to prove or disprove. Some people are able to see God’s trademark in everything, while others are incapable of seeing God in any part of their lives.</p>
<p>In book in the Jewish Biblical canon,  God’s conspicuous absence is particularly striking. These are the books of God, yet God is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, God’s absence in Megilat Esther is even more significant than most people realize.<span id="more-9139"></span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/03/05/rabbis-hid-god-reason/esther-goes-to-the-king-to-plead-for-the-safety-o/" rel="attachment wp-att-9141"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9141" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Esther-goes-to-the-king-to-plead-for-the-safety-o.gif?fit=600%2C600" alt="Esther-goes-to-the-king-to-plead-for-the-safety-o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Esther was a late inclusion in the Biblical canon. The Talmud says it was written by the Anshei Knesset HaGedolah along with a few other late books. Within a few hundred years, another version of Esther crops up in Greek and Hebrew. One later version has additions throughout the text and these additions are footnoted in another later Esther text. All of the additions share one general guiding principle. They all add God into the story.</p>
<p>For example, Mordechai is shown a prophetic vision at the beginning of the narrative, and it comes true at the end of the story. Also, the prayers of Mordechai and Esther are included in some versions. In the non-Tanach version, God plays a starring role in the scene where Esther breaches protocol and sees the king unannounced. Many of the small additions are found in our Midrashic sources.</p>
<p>This means that our Tanach specifically did not include God in the text of the story, and when we had the opportunity to add it back into the text or to infuse a little bit of religion into the story, we rejected that option. It’s not merely that God wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the Megilah. It’s that God was deliberately omitted from Megilat Esther. Why?</p>
<p>The answers to this question are not really different than the answer to the question of why God is simply not mentioned in the text. Those answers still work. But the question changes, and that means there can also be new and different answers.</p>
<p>God may have been <em>reinserted</em> into the text for religious reasons. But not our religion. Christians also see significance in the story of Esther. Some say she was a proto-Mary. Others say that Esther was a proto-Jesus. Some even say that Esther’s bravery preserved the Jewish people and the Davidic line, which allowed their messiah to be born several centuries later. The point is that Christians used the book for very Christian teachings, and that might be a reason some people inserted God into the text.</p>
<p>At that time, the Christian god was very “present” and the Jewish God was very hidden. Thus, it also might be that the Jewish God of the time was a hidden God while the god of the Christians at that time was thought to be more readily accessible. Between a version of Esther with a hidden God and a version with a very active God, the Jewish path is clear. It was a time of great peril for the Jewish people. Giving up hope in the invisible God likely made the very active god of the early Christians and pagans much more attractive. The rabbis wanted to help avoid that kind of thinking, and instead they wanted to train people to see the Hidden God.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense that the rabbis declined to edit God into the text. They specifically wanted to give the hidden God to the Jewish people. This would be their God for the duration of exile. So the rabbis made the somewhat controversial decision to give us this one book starring a Hidden God. The rabbis of the Anshei Knesset HaGedola were right. Our God is the Hidden God. One day, our God will no longer be hidden, but until then, we have Esther.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was asked to do a review of Noah for Haaretz so I took some time to see the movie today. My full review will be posted there, but there are a couple of things I want to say about the movie that are more appropriate for my blog.</p>
<p>In general, I’m not much of a Bible movie guy. But I was excited for Noah because I think it’s a story that is rich with complex questions that leave a ton of room for exploring old and new ideas. In this respect, Noah excelled. It did explore old and new ideas. Some of it was odd and very far afield, but it all makes sense in the context of the story.</p>
<p>That’s why I say Noah is a very Jewish movie. As far as I know, Christians have pretty monolithic views of the Old Testament. It’s just not as important as the New Testament to them and perhaps that is why there is less creativity and homiletics in Christianity. Also, Christianity is not a text based religion so there are fewer scholars and fewer opportunities to analyze text. Further, when studying religious trends, one scholar refers to “Biblical Literalism” as a marker of devotion to Christianity. Even the most fervent Orthodox Jews are not Biblical Literalists. Orthodox Jews treat the Old Testament as the basis for a sophisticated oral tradition. We are absolutely not Biblical Literalists. There are certainly boundaries of acceptable allegory and well established interpretations that are preferred over others. But it’s not true literalism.</p>
<p><span id="more-8276"></span></p>
<p>For Jews, Midrash has such a prominent place in Torah study. There are many kinds of Midrash, and one form of Midrash adds details and background to the Biblical narratives. It’s common for great Torah scholars to learn a new approach or twist on a Biblical story found in a Midrash. Our versions of these stories encompass competing and contradictory views. Even today, long after the closing of the Midrash texts, many great rabbis, especially in Chasidic circles, will derive new lessons and find new twists in the story to teach an important idea.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Noah-2014-Movie-Image-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8277" alt="Noah-2014-Movie-Image-2" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Noah-2014-Movie-Image-2.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In that sense, Noah takes the Jewish approach. The movie strays very far from the text. In the Bible, the story of the flood is long on construction details and specific dates but short on lessons and drama. The movie contrives much of its drama, but it’s not completely Hollywood imagination. Many of the superimposed conflicts and stories have roots in Torah and Jewish tradition. Whether it’s borrowing from the Book of Enoch or adapting from actual Midrashic teachings, much of the movie, with one giant exception, felt familiar enough to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most vocal and most common criticism I’ve seen from conservatives has been their objection to the ecological overtones of the movie. Aside from my personal opinion that worrying about this kind of not subliminal, subliminal message in a movie is silly, the truth is that our tradition supports this idea.</p>
<p>One Midrash teaches us that until Noah saved the animals in his ark, Man was prohibited from eating meat. Adam was a vegetarian. The animal world was protected and Man had no right to kill for his lunch. Only because Noah was responsible for the survival of the animals was he permitted to eat meat after the flood. Another tradition says that we couldn’t eat meat for our personal pleasure until we entered the Land of Canaan in the time of Joshua. According to one stream of Jewish thought, even then, eating meat is not ideal. Rav Kook famously held that vegetarianism was part of the Utopian Messianic era. This is not hippy drippy Hollywood. This is Judaism.</p>
<p>Similarly, in our tradition Noah was named for his farming innovations. One Midrash says that Noah invented the plow. It’s not a disconcerting invasion of foreign modernity to see Noah as a symbol of agrarian life. Another Midrash teaches us that Noah was super sensitive to the needs of the animals in the ark. He was a sort of proto-animal rights activist. That’s not the liberal movie industry, that’s Torah.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Throughout the </span>movie<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> there is a magical light source called <em>zohar.</em> It can be mined like a precious stone and could provide light and fire if used the right way. I thought </span>this was a clever adaptation of the Midrash that explains the <em>&#8220;tzohar&#8221;</em> that Noah placed in the ark for light. One opinion in the Midrash is that the <em>tzohar</em> was a precious stone that provided light. It seems obvious to me that this is the source for <i>zohar</i> in Noah. The movie simply turned <em>tzohar</em> into <em>zohar</em> (which means radiance) and assumed that these stones were available to everyone.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Here are some other adaptations from Midrash that occurred to me during the movie. Don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t reveal how these examples are used in the movie.  There is a Midrash that says that the animals came to the ark on their own. One Midrash teaches that people began to attack the ark as the rains began and the wild animals surrounded the ark to protect Noah and his family. Some rabbis teach that Noah had little faith and did not enter the ark until the water rose above his ankles. We have a tradition that Og was a kind of stowaway on the ark. There are more examples, but you get the picture. To someone familiar with Midrash, embellishments like these are expected and accepted. To Biblical Literalists, they might be offensive.</span></p>
<p>I also loved the portrayal of Noah as a conflicted hero. He is so easy to love and admire for much of the movie. Later in the movie he becomes an anti-hero. You’re rooting against him. To me, this was a modern take on the famous dispute between the rabbis about whether Noah was only righteous compared to the sinners of his time or if he was truly righteous despite his evil milieu. Before everyone is killed in the flood, Noah is objectively good. He is good compared to the people of his time. But when it’s just him and his family, there are no more evil people to compare with Noah, he falls and seems less righteous.</p>
<p>Noah is a pretty good movie. For people accustomed to learning lessons and studying rabbinic teachings that add to the Biblical text, the movie should not offend. But I do see why Biblical Literalists are so disturbed. I just don’t understand their expectations. At worst, they could view the movie about a fictional Noah the way they might view Neo from the Matrix as a fictional version of Jesus.</p>
<p>I thought it was really cool to see a modern retelling of the Noah story. Of course there is a ton of stuff that is decidedly not Torah or Judaism. But that didn’t bother me. I didn’t see the movie to learn the story of Noah. It’s a movie that tells the story of Noah in a new way but borrows heavily from text and tradition. Its purpose was to entertain, but it also has the side benefit of promoting discussion and debate about Torah. That’s a good thing too.</p>
<p><em>My full review in Haaretz touches on the themes and message of the movie. Read it here: <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/the-lighthouse/.premium-1.583432" target="_blank">Haaretz.com</a></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Atlantic takes note of a growing class of Americans. Fewer people identify as religious, but more people identify as spiritual. It&#8217;s far more common to believe in God than it is to be affiliated with a religion. Over 30% of people under 30 claim no religious preference. This might sound like they are all atheists. But over 70% of these same people who are not part of any religion believe in God.</p>
<p>Historically, these sort of people were dismissed. They were considered not to be serious about life and social issues. This might be changing. The article in The Atlantic argues that the political party that is able to tap into the needs of this emerging group will gain an advantage in future elections.</p>
<p>I see this trend in a different light.<span id="more-8055"></span></p>
<p>There are two main groups of religious people. One group is very spiritual. They follow God&#8217;s instructions in order that they should achieve spiritual gain. Perhaps they are interested in the spiritual rewards of the afterlife. Or maybe they are just afraid of the burning fires of hell. These people pay attention to what I call the Giant Scoreboard in the Sky. Others believe that every good deed they do will affect the world in a spiritual way. A sort of spiritual butterfly effect or religious form of Karma.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/photo-28.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8056" alt="photo (28)" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/photo-28.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The second group is more concerned with tangible effects of religious observance. They see God&#8217;s instructions as a moral imperative to act in a way that improves their lives and the lives of the people around them. This groups believes that the spiritual benefits to religious practice are unknowable and undetectable so they prefer to focus on the more social benefits of their religion.</p>
<p>To illustrate: One person might accept Jesus as their God and savior because they want to be spared eternal damnation. Another person might believe in Jesus because it enables them to be a better friend or spouse. Same result, but different motivations.</p>
<p>Another example: One person might keep the Sabbath because they know that keeping the Sabbath is good for the spiritual state of the universe and they will reap the rewards of this spiritual activity in the next world. Someone else might keep the Sabbath because they think God&#8217;s instruction that we rest one day per week will be good for them because it will give them an opportunity to focus on religious activity and their family. Same result, but different motivations.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think either of these paradigms are absolute. Some people will mix and match elements from both groups in their observance. I also think both of these paradigms are acceptable. Some people would never be able to adhere to religion if they had to go all in on either of these ideas. Some people are spiritually averse. Others need spirituality to sustain their observance.</p>
<p>But I think that the rise of spiritualists who do not believe in religion slightly threatens the second group. If more people become spiritualists and fewer people carry the mantle of appreciation for the social benefits of religion it will become harder and harder to sustain the second group.</p>
<p>Even if it&#8217;s not a threat per se, it indicates a trend toward more spiritual forms of religions. My own anecdotal experiences corroborate this trend. I notice more and more people taking an interest in more spiritually centric forms of Judaism. If the words &#8220;mystical,&#8221; &#8220;kabbalah,&#8221; or &#8220;secret&#8221; appear in the title to a class it generates more interest than a title without those words. When people meet me for the first time and they ask questions about Judaism, they are skewed toward the spiritual side of things. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this of course, but for people who fit more neatly into our second group, it can be alienating.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that this is all happening while the world is also trending away from belief and religion. It seems that the more atheism and rejection of God our world experiences, the more we see an increased interest in more spiritual forms of religion. It makes perfect sense. If there is a fear that too much rational or scientific thinking might lead people to atheism, it stands to reason that religions will prefer to focus on their more spiritual sides. And so we see an increased infusion of spirituality among people with no religious affiliation as well as within religions themselves.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great that people who opt our of religion are not giving up on God and they are finding spiritual fulfillment in unorganized religion. Many non-Orthodox Jewish communities follow a similar path. It&#8217;s a good thing overall. However, there are some consequences to consider as well. Less spiritual religious people might find they have less and less in common with other believers and that could become a problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that we ensure that both groups have a place in our religious communities. We can&#8217;t change human nature. So while many people feel intimately tied into the spiritual cosmos and it seems to be more popular now than ever before, others do not. Those people can&#8217;t be forced into seeing or feeling spirituality. It&#8217;s just impossible to legislate feelings. These people need the other kind of religion. Let&#8217;s make sure it doesn&#8217;t become extinct.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6761" alt="Westboro Baptist Church members protest at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/westboro.jpg?resize=300%2C200" data-recalc-dims="1" />We&#8217;ve all heard of the Westboro Baptist Church. They are the guys who protest at the funerals of U.S. soldiers blaming their deaths on gays in the military. They also hate Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Lady Gaga, obviously President Obama, and they love using the word fag.</p>
<p>But the church is not really a church and their worldview is not limited to making public protests. The church is more like a family. Almost everyone is related to the head of the church, Fred Phelps. Their theology is a very chaste brand of Baptist style Christianity and is consistently conservative. Check out this great documentary on the WBC: <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtfgxo_the-most-hated-family-in-america_shortfilms" target="_blank">The Most Hated Family in America</a>. <em>(Another previous documentary filmmaker wound up joining the church!)</em></p>
<p>Megan Phelps-Roper was considered the future of the church. A few weeks ago she left the church and won&#8217;t be going back. I learned that one of the keys to her successfully leaving the church was David Abitbol, otherwise known at @Jewlicious on Twitter. Abitbol used theological arguments to diffuse much of what Megan had been taught. She didn&#8217;t leave right away. She kept trying to revive her faith and believe as she always had. But she simply could not. So she left.</p>
<p>As an aside, how cool is that? Amazing work by Abitbol. He was outraged by the WBC so he did something about it. Very impressive.<span id="more-6760"></span> The rest of us were just outraged. The best I could muster was a 25 page paper trying to figure out a way they could be sued without protection from the 1st Amendment.</p>
<p>I found Megan on Facebook and requested to be her friend. She accepted and I thanked her for accepting the request and in the process called her a hero.</p>
<p>To me, she is a hero because she is &#8220;one who shows great courage&#8221; and also because she is &#8220;an object of extreme admiration.&#8221; Obviously it takes great courage to leave one&#8217;s family and entire life behind. But what about Megan is worthy of &#8220;extreme admiration?&#8221;</p>
<p>More to the point, should, as a religious orthodox Jew, be admiring someone who has forsaken their religion? Is there something hypocritical about admiring her for leaving her group and me sticking to mine?</p>
<p>I have two responses.</p>
<p>First, there is no comparison between the beliefs of the WBC and orthodox Judaism. The WBC puts the focus of their religion on hate. While orthodox Judaism does have some abhorrent beliefs, these are not core beliefs, nor are they central to observance today. If a person didn&#8217;t believe in the abhorrent parts of Judaism, no one would even know. Whereas in the WBC, those beliefs are the cornerstone of their religious observance. You can&#8217;t possibly avoid it.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think everyone should challenge their beliefs. It&#8217;s not easy to challenge one&#8217;s own beliefs and subject one&#8217;s views to scrutiny. Many of our great rabbis prohibited us from doing that. They felt it is too dangerous. We are strongly urged not to read books that are contradictory to our faith. They might be dangerous. But it&#8217;s also dangerous not to analyze one&#8217;s beliefs at all. It&#8217;s also dangerous if one expects every answer to be perfect. There are not always good answers. We need to be able to be comfortable without all the answers. But as our great rabbis taught us, we must know what to answer. Sometimes, the answer is &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Other times, the answer is &#8220;A is better than B, but A is not perfect.&#8221; Clearly, we are supposed to subjugate our beliefs to some testing so that we will have some answers.</p>
<p>Questions without any answers led Megan away from the WBC but Megan has not left religion. She simply left a hateful, hurtful, twisted brand of religion.</p>
<p>Megan challenged her beliefs and her beliefs failed to stand up to the most basic of questions. Walking away from one&#8217;s entire family because one is fairly certain their beliefs are false and harmful takes great bravery. It is admirable to do what one feels is right against the odds. If I was as convinced that what I was doing is wrong as Megan was convinced about her beliefs, I would hope to have as much courage as Megan. So yes, what she did was admirable. Challenging conventional wisdom and changing one&#8217;s beliefs is admirable. Doing it and acting on it is heroic.</p>
<p>The world would be a far greater place if more of us challenged conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>I hope we will hear more from Megan in the future. Hers is an important voice in the religious discourse of the 21st century.</p>

<p>The best book I read this year was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists: A Non-believer&#8217;s Guide to the Uses of Religion</a> by Alain de Botton. The author is a Jewish atheist and apparently a direct descendant of the author of the Lechem Mishnah commentary on Maimonides&#8217; Mishnah Torah. The book is excellent and I highly recommend that everyone read it.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the book is written for atheists. I think believers should read this book at least as much as atheists should read it. The book tries to show that there is a lot that atheists can learn from religion. Generally speaking, de Botton argues that even if religion is  complete bunk there is a reason it developed, evolved, and flourishes. There are evolutionary needs that religion addresses. Religion serves a very important role in the scheme of man&#8217;s existence and when people abandon religion as atheists, they risk losing the very important evolutionary benefits of religion.</p>
<p>In other words, atheists cannot abandon the principles of religion simply because they disbelieve in God. In fact, it almost makes no sense to do that. An atheist must believe that religion evolved as a response to a human need because the atheists does not believe that religion could possibly be a revelation from God since God does not exist according to the atheist! It follows that according to atheists, religion is a human response to some innate needs and its development and success are vital to the success and progress of humanity. Excising religion from the human experience may be necessary for the atheist, but it is fraught with risks. There are elements of religion that are necessary for human development and without religion, those needs may not be met.<span id="more-6667"></span></p>
<p>So the book then goes on to describe some of the humanistic benefits of various religions. Most of the focus is on Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. I found the references to Judaism very fascinating and enlightening. The author even uses some of the harshest victims of atheistic criticism as examples of worthy ideas that should be emulated. For example, he uses mikvah, (yes mikvah!), as an example of attaching ritual and meaning to washing. He says that there is something valuable in attaching bathing to renewal and associating outer washing with inner purity. As orthodox Jews, we may scoff at this humanistic approach to mikvah and it may not be sufficient to allay some of the discomfort that some orthodox Jewish women have with mikvah, but it is refreshing to see a non-believer try to find beauty and meaning in this practice.</p>
<p>Another great example in the book is his section on forgiveness. Yom Kippur is an ingenious way of reconnecting people. It is a day where we are forced to reconcile with our past. Non-believers need such a day as well.</p>
<p>Most importantly, religion creates community and responsibility toward one another. The book mentions Jewish weddings and Bar Mitzvah celebrations as important rituals within a community that should be emulated by non-believers.</p>
<p>The follow up point to each example is that atheists must create analogous practices and rituals for their lives in order to satisfy their needs that are not being met by the absence of religion in their lives. The book proposes cathedrals for atheists, yearly celebrations of bounty, and other corollaries to religious practices for atheists. The proposals are fantastic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mostly theoretical book because I don&#8217;t see how any of this would every come into being. But if it would happen, I think it would be great for society.</p>
<p>Although the book is written for atheists, I think there is something important here for believers as well. We need to appreciate the depth and beauty of our religious practices. We need to see how to a non-believer many of our practices are useful even if God did not exist. To us, who believe God does exist, the benefits of religion are even greater. We need to appreciate how incredibly useful our religion is to our psyche and wellbeing and we need to thank God for giving us such a wonderful way of life to satisfy those needs. This is the true value of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> to the believer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not recommending orthopraxy. I am suggesting that the believer take into account all that religion does for the believer in a religious but also in a secular, psychological, and evolutionary way. We need to realize that what we are doing was given to us by God and it goes beyond just ritual or Divine command that has no non-religious benefit. We should acknowledge and explore the potential humanistic reasons for practicing orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The book also can serve as a bit of a bridge between atheists and believers. It gives us common ground and serves as an antidote to the Dawkins inspired derision of religion. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to see a debate between Dawkins and de Botton. I also wish the Chief Rabbi would have read this book and incorporated some of its lessons in his Op-Ed earlier this week.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> enough. It is a great book for believers and non-believers alike.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/angus_t_jones_blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6546" title="angus_t_jones_blog" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/angus_t_jones_blog.jpg?resize=195%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>There is a very lowbrow television show called Two and Half Men. It used to star Charlie Sheen, but he went off the reservation. Ashton Kutsher took over for Sheen. But the other two stars have been there since the start. Believe it or not, despite capitalizing on bathroom humor, objectification of women, and recycling its own jokes, Two and Half Men is the #1 comedy on TV every year and it makes zillions of dollars. (What does that say about American culture?)</p>
<p>The stars of the show make upwards of $350,000 per 30 minute episode. Angus T. Jones is the actor who plays the youngest member of the household. He is a very, very wealthy young man.</p>
<p>Recently he has been doing some soul searching. Apparently making millions did not satisfy Mr. Jones, he needed some spirituality in his life. So he joined a black Mega Church in Atlanta that is Seventh Day Adventist (my favorite kind of Christians), where a man named The Forerunner preaches about the ills of today&#8217;s society. The Forerunner did a two part video of Angus T. Jones&#8217; Testimony. This is Mega-Church-Speak for one&#8217;s story of how they found Jesus.</p>
<p>If you want to hear Angus&#8217;s story click the YouTube link at the bottom of the post. Fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>But there is one quote in there that has become newsworthy.<span id="more-6545"></span> Angus says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;If you watch &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217;, please stop watching &#8216;Two and a Half Men,&#8217; I&#8217;m on &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217; and I don&#8217;t want to be on it. If I am doing any harm, I don&#8217;t want to be here. I don&#8217;t want to be contributing to the enemy&#8217;s plan&#8230; You cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like that. I&#8217;m not okay with what I&#8217;m learning, what the Bible says and being on that television show.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Now this set off a bit of a firestorm. Angus has since apologized and all seems okay at this point.</p>
<p>The question I have is whether Angus should be working on a show that he feels goes against his morals. If he feels that it is such a disgraceful show, how can he not be a hypocrite if he still acts on the show?</p>
<p>Perhaps the fact that he is under contract makes fulfilling the terms of his obligation the morally correct thing to do. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>It just seems so disingenuous to talk about not wanting to be on the show and then being on the show. No one is forcing him. He should have the strength to act upon his convictions. If it&#8217;s really so bad (and apparently it is) he should put his money where his mouth is, and quit.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&#8217;s just a lot talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/western_religious_symbols.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5278" title="western_religious_symbols" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/western_religious_symbols.jpg?resize=214%2C167" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Remember Tapps? Tapps is the governing body of Texas parochial schools including Beren Academy. A few weeks ago they became a household name after they refused to adjust their tournament schedule out of deference to Beren&#8217;s observance of Shabbos. Everyone from CNN, the NY Times, ESPN, and others reported the story and eventually Tapps acquiesced. Beren played Friday afternoon and won. They moved on to the championship on Saturday night and lost in the final game.</p>
<p>At the time, some people accused Tapps of anti-Semitism. I didn&#8217;t feel like it was anti-Semitism as much as it was myopia and insensitivity to others. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/28/beren-academy-forfeits-tournament-game-because-of-shabbos-and-the-world-reacts/">Beren Academy Forfeits Tournament Game Because of Shabbos and the World Reacts</a>).</p>
<p>The NY Times decided to do a little digging and has made some interesting discoveries. While Tapps may not be anti-Semitic on its face, some new information forces us to reconsider.<span id="more-5277"></span></p>
<p>It seems that not only did Tapps make life difficult for a Jewish school, Beren, but they have made it impossible, if not extremely degrading, for Muslim schools to join Tapps. While their decisions with regard to the Jewish school were ambiguous, their actions toward the Muslim schools can only be described as bigoted.</p>
<p>One school was given the opportunity to be considered for acceptance in Tapps and was asked to fill out a questionnaire. No  non-Muslim schools were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The queries on the questionnaire were also quite offensive. Here are some of the nuggets discovered by NY Times:</p>
<p><em>Historically, there is nothing in the Koran that fully embraces Christianity or Judaism in the way a Christian and/or a Jew understands his religion. Why, then, are you interested in joining an association whose basic beliefs your religion condemns?”</em></p>
<p><em>It is our understanding that the Koran tells you not to mix with (and even eliminate) the infidels. Christians and Jews fall into that category. Why do you wish to join an organization whose membership is in disagreement with your religious beliefs?</em></p>
<p><em>How does your school address certain Christian concepts? (i.e. celebrating Christmas)</em></p>
<p><em>When was the Bible allegedly polluted? Does the Koran actually state that the Bible is polluted?</em></p>
<p><em>What is your attitude about the spread of Islam in America? What are the goals of your school in this regard?</em></p>
<p>The school answered the questionnaire and was still not accepted into Tapps.</p>
<p>Tapps also sent a survey to the other schools asking questions like &#8220;would you leave the association if Muslim schools were included?&#8221;and &#8220;Is it in the best interest of Tapps to accept Islamic schools for membership?&#8221;. The results may be even more disturbing. 67% of respondents felt Muslim schools should not be allowed in Tapps.</p>
<p>There are multiple levels to this. First, Tapps is clearly not a friendly place for non-Christians. They are fervent in their beliefs and the beliefs of others not acceptable to them. They don&#8217;t play on their Sabbath, but refused to acknowledge the Jewish Sabbath. They believe that Muslims and Jews are doomed because they do not accept Jesus. (Generally, Christians really believe this, it says so in the <a href="http://www.openbible.info/topics/non_believers" target="_blank">Bible</a>, just many Christians don&#8217;t act on these beliefs in the public sphere.) But they challenge those same beliefs in others. These beliefs are abhorrent and are not acceptable in 2012. One can, <em>no, one must,</em> be fervently religious without being hateful toward other religions.</p>
<p>I am sure there are some of you who think that the questions asked of Muslims are legitimate. I have a few things to say to you. First of all, this is sports league, not a religious debate league. It should not matter one bit what the beliefs of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are with regard to anything other than the scheduling and executing of the league schedule. The idea that the Muslim schools need to be &#8220;vetted&#8221; just so that they could play in the same league is extremely xenophobic.</p>
<p>Second, a questionnaire is not appropriate even if the league were a debate of religion league. They betray a deeply held prejudice against non-members of Christianity in general and an even deeper prejudice for Islam. These kids are living in Texas, not Saudi Arabia! Obviously their parents are more comfortable in a free country like America than they would be in a fascist country. Further, they are asking to play basketball, a Western game. They just want to be American kids. The questioning is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Third the particular questions are even more inappropriate. All religions condemn other religions. That&#8217;s a fact of religions. Move on. Accept it. The Christmas question is hilarious. Christians have asked me with incredulity &#8220;You don&#8217;t celebrate Christmas?!&#8221;. That&#8217;s right. Non-Christians don&#8217;t celebrate Christmas. Why is this an issue? The question that gives it all away is the last one. The &#8220;spread of Islam&#8221; is an irrational fear that has become a deeply rooted fundamental belief of non-Muslims. American Muslims who I know and talk to about these issues have no such agenda. Sure, there are insane fundamentalists who live in backwards, oppressed countries who want to convert the entire world to Islam. They have nothing to do with normal American Muslims. But thanks to the tireless efforts of heroes like Pam Geller, the average, bigoted, non-thinking, Christian American actually thinks that his religious beliefs are under siege from normal American Muslims. This is hate. Pure and simple.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t really blame Tapps. They are just buying what their heroes are selling. I blame those who are selling it. The best way that I know of eliminating hate is by getting to know one another. When people who are different on the outside get to know each other, preconceived notions are burst and understanding and appreciating can begin. The unfortunate result of Tapps&#8217; bigotry is that it reinforces itself by discouraging their schools from increased interaction with the Muslim students. No interaction means no opportunities to unlearn their bigotry. But perhaps that is what Tapps wanted all along.</p>
<p>Although I was willing to overlook Tapps&#8217; faux pas with regard to Beren as simple-mindedness, I am now changing my opinion and declaring them general bigots towards anyone not of the same religious beliefs as them. In 2012 this is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for Christians in Texas and it is unacceptable for Jews and Muslims as well. We are all part of a global community now. Deal with each other in a civil way or go away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Religious-Symbols-II1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5190" title="Religious-Symbols-II1" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Religious-Symbols-II1.jpg?resize=298%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Every religion has abhorrent beliefs. An abhorrent belief is a part of one&#8217;s religion that would offend an outsider. All religions have these beliefs. Whether they concern non-members of the religion, women, slavery, genocide or the afterlife, many religious beliefs are upsetting to members of other religions.</p>
<p>Historically, these beliefs were kept within the bounds of the religious group and no one was the wiser. By and large, people didn&#8217;t have access to religious texts and codes of other religions. There was little interaction between people of various religions. Abhorrent beliefs were safe.</p>
<p>But things have changed. The international community has become like a small village. We all know each other&#8217;s business. Television and the Internet have made us all virtual neighbors. Enemies used to be neighbors or neighboring territories. Now enemies can be anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Last week, one abhorrent belief of Mormonism was exposed (again).<span id="more-5188"></span> I don&#8217;t mean to pick on Mormonism, we will get to Judaism soon. And while on the topic of Mormons, let&#8217;s not forget the comment made by a presidential candidate aide dismissing all Mormons as non-Christians. Anyway, the Church of Latter Day Saints has a practice of <a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;sourceId=1ec52f2324d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____" target="_blank">baptizing all sorts of people who are dead</a>. They don&#8217;t deny it. In fact you can read several fascinating article on the LDS website about the practice. They base it on sources in the Old and New <em>(sic)</em> Testament and in their eyes it is a beautiful honor to the deceased. When it was discovered (again) that they were posthumously baptizing Holocaust victims, outrage ensued. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/elie-wiesel-calls-on-mitt-romney-to-make-mormon-church-stop-proxy-baptisms-of-jews/2012/02/14/gIQAZK6bER_story.html" target="_blank">Elie Wiesel and the Wiesenthal Center demanded that they stop and that they apologize.</a> Somehow Mitt Romney was being asked to apologize as well.</p>
<p>I found myself conflicted. On one hand I have always had a distaste for baptism for the dead. It is the reason I won&#8217;t use a site like Ancestry.com which is owned by the Mormon Church and the data is mined for baptism purposes. I find the practice abhorrent. It really is a little twisted to think about baptizing people who were killed simply because they were Jews! On the other hand I also find it silly and meaningless. Why should it bother me if they say some magic words that in my opinion accomplish absolutely nothing? It&#8217;s a tough call. It&#8217;s certainly not as bad as Elie Wiesel thinks.</p>
<p>Either way, the issue is really what should the Mormon Church do about its abhorrent belief that they should baptize dead non-Mormons? They think they are doing a good and moral act. To outsiders it is offensive. What to do?</p>
<p>Closer to home, Judaism has its fair share of abhorrent beliefs. Most of them no longer apply. Most of them have either been reinterpreted or require circumstances that are not currently at play. Some people want to accelerate those circumstances and create the environment that would allow and require those abhorrent beliefs be put into practice.</p>
<p>Sometimes religious people have abhorrent beliefs or ideas that are not essential to their religion. They may think that these are religious rules, but they are not. These are social conventions that are more likely the result of years of persecution, insularity, and fear as opposed to drawn from religious texts. But the lines are rarely so clear. More recent texts are likely to mix the two and then provide sources for new abhorrent beliefs that are not intrinsic to the religion.</p>
<p>What does the orthodox Jew do about these beliefs?</p>
<p>There are two approaches that I know. The first is based on a famous thought experiment called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma" target="_blank">Euthyphro Dilemma</a>. In short, the idea is that if God commands something it is intrinsically moral. Thus, the social conventions that may make a belief seem abhorrent are really false and true morality only exists in God&#8217;s commandments. This has appeal but it is a tough pill to swallow. Are we really comfortable with Divinely commanded genocide? I&#8217;d rather not have to make that choice. It also seems incongruous that God would create humans who would develop over time into beings whose sense of morality is at odds with God&#8217;s word.</p>
<p>The second approach is to interpret abhorrent beliefs in a way that makes them less abhorrent. This doesn&#8217;t always work, and could rankle the feathers of the more traditionalist among us, but when it works, it works well. For example, there is a commandment to hate (and kill) Amalek. This seems at odds with human perception of fairness and compassion. Over on Hirhurim, R&#8217; Norman Lamm is quoted and I direct your attention there (<a href="http://torahmusings.com/2012/02/when-hatred-is-a-mitzvah/" target="_blank">Hirhurim</a>) as his answer is not relevant to this discussion.</p>
<p>Which all leads to the most fascinating question of all: When these abhorrent beliefs are exposed or shared with outsiders and they make us look bad or old-fashioned, or immoral, or bigoted in the eyes of those outsiders is that a desecration of God&#8217;s Name?</p>
<p>Maimonides codifies several examples of kiddush and chillul Hashem in Chapter 5 of Yesodei HaTorah. None of them really concern the opinions of outsiders about our beliefs. They all concern how we act. There are times we must die for the sake of God&#8217;s commandments and there are other instances where our status as Jews or scholars requires us to act in a refined manner. Failure to do so is a chillul Hashem. The principle of chillul Hashem as it relates to how others think of our beliefs does not enter the conversation.</p>
<p>I think we can safely say that exposing what the Torah says cannot be considered a chillul Hashem.</p>
<p>However, this does not account for social conventions, prejudices, and anti-social ideas that emanate from insularity or superstition that are confused with religious fervor or beliefs. I think it is fair to say that exposing a non-essential abhorrent belief might be a chillul Hashem. That is unfortunately the inevitable result of the new global community. So what is the appropriate response when these secrets are revealed (as they were in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/20/unorthodox-book-review-and-analysis/">Unorthodox</a>)?</p>
<p>The solution is not to cry chillul Hashem and force the issue back into the dark hole from where it came. The solution is to eradicate non-essential abhorrent beliefs. There is little we can do about our essential beliefs that don&#8217;t jive with modern sensibilities. We have to hope that others recognize that every religion and even many non-religions have abhorrent beliefs and so long as they don&#8217;t cause any harm, they can be ignored. Much in the same way as I can ignore baptism of the dead. But if there are non-essential abhorrent beliefs in our community that can be changed or removed, I think it is wise and prudent to do all that we can to eliminate these items from our community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion-and-politics2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5104" title="religion-and-politics2" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion-and-politics2.jpeg?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Politicians from the Right often cite God or Jesus as a basis for political positions. Some even make the claim that they are running for office upon the advise of God Himself.</p>
<p>Now, it is impossible for God to have told more than one particular person that they are destined to be the next president. So either all but one are lying or they are all lying. You decide.</p>
<p>Either way, the whole concept of appealing to God&#8217;s authority in politics is very silly. The reason it is silly is because none of these people have had any specific revelation. Rather, they apply their interpretations of ancient texts, or worse, their personal feelings or emotional stirrings and claim that these are Divine messages. What makes matters even fuzzier is that politicians are usually businessmen or lawyers. They are not theologians or members of the clergy. Their understanding of their own religions is as basic as the average American&#8217;s understanding of their religions. Their understanding of other religions is even poorer.</p>
<p>Case in point: President Obama invoked the teachings of Jesus as a basis for taxes. The response has been vicious. Most of the criticism has been because of the seeming transparent pandering to the religious voters. This is a valid criticism. But only to a point. Politicians are professional panderers. We just don&#8217;t like it when <em>we can tell</em>.</p>
<p>The more important point, that is being overlooked, is how religious beliefs are able to conform to political positions. <span id="more-5102"></span>It&#8217;s too easy to make an argument for almost any predetermined position using religious faith or texts. The stories are obscure, the analogies are tenuous and the bias is overwhelming. It&#8217;s to the point that I can&#8217;t take any appeal to religion seriously. Further, not everyone <em>wants </em>to follow the teachings of Jesus. Those same teachings were used as a tool for death and destruction for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Are taxes some form of charity, as Obama suggests? Maybe. But religion is not going to provide the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Political policy should be based on reasoning that is free from religious influence. It should not be guided by love for God or religion nor should it be guided by disbelief in God or hatred for religion.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t blame politicians. I blame the religious fervor of American citizens that demands that their politicians double as religious leaders. It&#8217;s foolish to assume that politicians know enough about religion to have intelligent opinions on theological matters. We should stop demanding it. Along the same lines, we should not turn to one specific version of a religion to solve our problems or as a basis for setting policy. At best, it is silly and at worse it is offensive.</p>
<p>I think the other speaker at the event at which the president spoke had good advice. Eric Metaxas suggested we remove phony religiosity from public discourse. Since it is all phony, I say we remove it all.</p>

I saw it just after I wrote about the modern day exorcist here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/28/demons-dybbuks-devils-and-exorcism/" target="_blank">Demons, Dybbuks, Devils and Exorcism</a>. Buying this book was a smart decision. I read the book a little while back and neglected to do a review but I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you all about this book since I read it.</p>
<p>The author, J.H Chajes, is a professor at University of Haifa. He is a distant relative of the great Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> is very scholarly and well researched. Yet, it reads like a novel, well almost like a novel, and it kept me engrossed in its content from start to finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> chronicles the rise of recorded incidents of dybbuks and exorcism in the era of mystical writings of the Arizal&#8217;s students. Most of the book takes place in the 16th and 17th centuries. The book traces the relationship between Christian, Muslim and Jewish exorcism legends and practice as well. An appendix has full accounts of exorcisms found in rabbinic literature from that era.</p>
<p>As a skeptic, I found the restraint of Chajes astounding. It is almost as if he is winking the entire time that he is writing about demonic / disembodied soul possession. You just know that he can&#8217;t believe what he is writing as fact is even possible. But he writes as an objective 3rd party about rabbis and others performing exorcisms with a straight face.</p>
<p>There are a few points that I took away from the book that are worth sharing.<span id="more-4968"></span> First of all, the book mentions some disputes between rabbis. They were vicious disagreements. Accusations of philandering, abject immorality and horrible insults are hurled the way of one particular rabbi. I can only imagine what our rabbinic disputes will look like to historians some time in the future. Fascinating to read and fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>Second, the book supports the theory that &#8220;the more knowledge becomes accessible, the more some religious leaders will try to &#8216;esotericize&#8217; their religion to maintain a level of separation between the masses and the public&#8221;. I know, that theory is a mouthful. With regard to exorcism it works as follows. The masses were becoming more literate throughout the world. Exorcism was an art reserved for spiritual leaders and scholars. It was not available to the masses no matter how learned they became. Thus, the existence of demons and dybbuks reinforced the need for leadership. It is similar to today&#8217;s maximalist position of Daas Torah. In a time that more orthodox Jews can study the sources and responsa on a given subject, the religious leaders have reserved a segment of inaccessible knowledge under the maximalist position of Daas Torah. I&#8217;m not saying this is wrong or intentional, rather it is a pattern and it happens.</p>
<p>My third point for this review is the nature of the relationship between Jewish scholars and their Christian and Muslim counterparts. It seems that there was much interaction between them and they worked together, at least for the sake of exorcism. It was nice to see cooperation instead of the stereotypical debates and polemics against one another. If they could do it, so could we.</p>
<p>If you have ANY interest in dybbuks or demons or exorcism or 16th century mysticism, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20071121-first-thanksgiving.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4873" title="20071121-first-thanksgiving" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20071121-first-thanksgiving.png?resize=300%2C252" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>You might find it odd that the day after Thanksgiving I am writing about Thanksgiving. The truth is that I am not really writing about Thanksgiving rather some of the nutty things that happened this year on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Of course I am talking about some the controversies that arose regarding the celebrations of Thanksgiving that don&#8217;t fit the mold of the religious Christian Thanksgiving. Two incidents in particular created some buzz but I am sure there were others as well.</p>
<p>First we turn to the Butterball Turkey situation. One blogger called upon her readers to boycott Butterball because they dared to have their Turkeys Halal certified. This means that it is slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law. It is very similar to Shechita, the method of slaughter required by Jewish law. According to Ms. Geller:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Halal turkey, slaughtered according to the rules of Islamic law, is just the opposite of what Thanksgiving represents: freedom and inclusiveness, neither of which are allowed for under that same Islamic law.&#8221;<span id="more-4872"></span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, Thanksgiving DOES NOT represent freedom or inclusiveness. It never has and never will. I can provide Ms. Geller with a hint as to what the holiday represents &#8211; it&#8217;s in the name. Oh yes. It&#8217;s thanks and appreciation.</p>
<p>More importantly, any religious ceremony is by default not free or inclusive. Jewish law, Canon law, Islamic law, any religious law that makes specific requirements is not (on the surface) &#8220;freedom&#8221;. They are restrictions. Moreover, religious law is never going to be inclusive. It calls for rituals that make the performer of the ritual a religious person and by default the one who does not perform the ritual irreligious. This can create a barrier between the religious and irreligious. All religions suffer this potential flaw.</p>
<p>Just look at my Tim Tebow post from a couple days ago: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/23/tim-tebows-relationship-with-his-god/">Tim Tebow’s Relationship With His God</a>. Not everyone is so comfortable with Tebow&#8217;s religious proclivities. But have a look at the comment left by the Christian fellow in the comments. Do you think his religion is &#8220;inclusive&#8221; of me? (Or Ms. Geller?) Is that the sound of freedom? In Ms. Geller&#8217;s world that makes Tebow the commenter people who should not allowed to celebrate Thanksgiving. They are not inclusive enough.</p>
<p>Ms. Geller calls Halal slaughtering a form of torture. This is obviously offensive to all kosher eating people as well.</p>
<p>But the real point is that Ms. Geller is being as two-faced as one can be. By denying an entire group the right to have a Thanksgiving dinner, Ms. Geller is being as freedom hating and non-inclusive as one can be. But that was obvious.</p>
<p>Finally, I imagine that the reason Butterball markets Halal turkeys is because it is good business. To me, that&#8217;s just the free market that Ms. Geller loves so much.</p>
<p>Now we turn to controversy number two. The President gave the traditional Presidential Thanksgiving address and neglected to mention God in his words. The president dedicated this year&#8217;s holiday celebration to the troops fighting our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also thanked the volunteers in soup kitchens across America. So what was the problem? He did not mention God. This is a terrible sin that violates the ancient and holy laws of Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Never mind that in the Presidential Thanksgiving Proclamation he did mention God.</p>
<p>The omission set off a firestorm of vitriol toward the president.</p>
<p>A particularly bombastic twitterer called Obama a &#8220;militant atheist&#8221; for not mentioning God in the address. As irresponsible and insane of a statement it is to &#8220;out&#8221; someone as an atheist when they clearly are not an atheist, the tweet ignores the Proclamation and Obama&#8217;s 2009 and 2010 Thanksgiving addresses where he did mention God.</p>
<p>How is this reconciled? Was he a believer before but now he is all of the sudden a &#8220;militant atheist&#8221;? Or maybe he was a &#8220;militant atheist&#8221; all along but he has finally decided to own up to his true non-beliefs?</p>
<p>As far as militant atheists go, Obama would hardly be very successful. He goes to Church, says the appropriate God Bless Americas and to my knowledge has never engaged a believer in debate trying to convince the believer that belief in God is wrong.</p>
<p>Obama is not an atheist and certainly is not a militant atheist. This the kind of message that someone tweets to pander to right wing conservative Christians and bait left wing liberal non-Christians. It&#8217;s a call for attention. Well, he got it. Congratulations. But at what cost? Credibility. You can only say so many crazy things before everything you say is considered crazy.</p>
<p>All the silliness aside, I think that Thanksgiving is one day that should be enjoyed and celebrated by people of all faiths and people of no faith. That Ms. Geller and the bombastic twitterer feel that Thanksgiving must be celebrated in one way and in no other is a fallacy. Thanksgiving is the perfect time to push aside our differences and be thankful for the wonderful things in our lives to whomever or whatever we attribute them to.</p>
<p>The irony is that both Ms. Geller and the bombastic twitterer are Jewish and that they would prefer a Christian version of the holiday than a non-denominational celebration tells me that they have sold out the ever important freedom of religion and inclusiveness of America&#8217;s Constitution for the sake making friends in religious right.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is for everyone. Let&#8217;s keep it that way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tim-tebow-tebowing.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4870" title="tim-tebow-tebowing" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tim-tebow-tebowing.jpg?resize=250%2C250" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>There is nothing quite like Tim Tebow.</p>
<p>He is one of the most decorated NCAA Football players of all time. He worked for years as a Missionary spreading the Gospel in Southeast Asia. He is arguably the worst passing quarterback in the NFL. He is by far the most talked about sports personality.</p>
<p>Quite a combination. Much of the talk of Tim Tebow relates to his very obvious religious beliefs. I say they are obvious because Tebow kneels in prayer during the game. He points to the sky all the time. He invokes the name of his God every time he has a chance to do so. Tebow&#8217;s antics inspired an entire internet meme called <a href="http://tebowing.com/" target="_blank">#Tebowing</a>. People would kneel as if in prayer at the most awkward times and places and snap a picture. This is aside from the very clever <a href="http://occupytebow.com/" target="_blank">#occupytebow</a> movement which is not relevant to this blog post.</p>
<p>The point is that Tebow takes his religion very seriously. Whenever athletes thank God and praise God for their accomplishments it can be irksome to everyone. Religious people of the same religion, religious people of other religions and atheists can all find ways to be offended.</p>
<p>Does God really want the Home team to beat the Away team? Does God really give special powers to some teams and not to other teams? Does a player&#8217;s religious conviction really have an impact on a game?<span id="more-4868"></span></p>
<p>I think the answer to all those questions is no. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/30/whose-fault-is-a-dropped-game-wininng-touchdown/">Whose Fault is a Dropped Game-Wininng Touchdown?</a> for my feelings on this one.</p>
<p>In fact, please read that post because you&#8217;ll see that I actually agree with Tim Tebow on this issue.</p>
<p>Tebow was asked about invoking God as part of his athletic accomplishments and he didn&#8217;t take the bait. He answered that he doesn&#8217;t give God the credit or the blame. He is merely using his platform as a way of teaching people about his religion. He emphatically denied that his religion gives him an edge or that he can play better because of God. He focused on the opportunity to use his fame and success to glorify the name of his God.</p>
<p>He also mentions that football does not define him. He is defined by his morality and good acts. He is defined by his character. So his religion is not a cause. It is merely a basis for his life. It is not part of his game on the field.</p>
<p>I think that is a great answer. Great job by Tebow.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me is that Tebow invokes the name of his God, Jesus, and that is somewhat acceptable within society. Imagine a Muslim player praising Allah or a Jewish person praising God (not Jesus). I don&#8217;t think they would be as accepted.</p>
<p>Christian displays of religious fervor are far more tolerated than that of any other religion. It can make the rest of us feel uncomfortable. Tebow is doing it in a way that minimizes the discomfort for others but even his way has rankled many people. It would be wise for people to limit religion to religious activities and not pepper it throughout their public lives.</p>
<p>Watch Tebow&#8217;s interview. The religious stuff is near the end:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/salt-lake-mormon-temple.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4833" title="salt-lake-mormon-temple" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/salt-lake-mormon-temple.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A couple of weeks ago the New York Times featured a Fashion and Style article that caught my attention. I never read that section. But the headline grabbed me because it was not really about fashion or style. It was about religion and Mormons in particular.</p>
<p>The article talked about modern Mormons trying to fit in with their non-Mormon social circles.</p>
<p>I have a &#8220;thing&#8221; with Mormons.</p>
<p>Of all the religions in the world, I think the closest religion to Orthodox Judaism in many respects is Mormonism. I don&#8217;t mean in a theoligical sense. I mean in a practical, real world sense.</p>
<p>The kinds of challenges and successes that Mormons have resemble that of orthodox Jews. Both are minority religions in a predominantly &#8220;Traditional Christian&#8221; country. Both give their adherents opportunities to thrive in the modern world. But both also have a bit of a tradition of reluctance to modernity. So it is striking that both have embraced modernity in their own ways.<span id="more-4832"></span></p>
<p>Brigham Young University is a Mormon college. It strikes me as being very similar to Yeshiva University or even my alma mater, Ner Israel. I wrote about that sometime a while back: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/02/the-byu-honor-code-and-me/">The BYU Honor Code and Me</a></p>
<p>To me the article in the NY Times sounded a lot like Modern Orthodox Judaism. Young people who aspire to achieve success in the secular world who are also extremely restricted by their religion within that secular world. The restrictions are different between but they are similar as well.</p>
<p>For example: Clothing. Mormons are required to wear modest clothing on the outside but also a religious article of clothing on the inside. Orthodox Jews have the same. Different in the details but similar in spirit.</p>
<p>Another example: Social Drinking. Alcohol plays a huge social role. Parties serve alcohol, bars are frequent places of meeting and Mormons are forbidden from drinking alcohol altogether. Orthodox Jews are allowed to drink. But there are many restrictions that prevent (perhaps by design) absolute fraternization with non-Jews. Wine must be kosher. Mixed drinks must contain only kosher ingredients. Social drinking can be cumbersome.</p>
<p>I think these sort of parallels reflect a greater parallel between the two religions. This all leads me to one important thing to consider.</p>
<p>We live in a country that is predominately Christian. By and large, Christians have been wonderful friends to the Jews and particularly to Israel. But there is always the sneaking suspicion that we are still &#8220;the other&#8221;. I know I sense it. Similarly, Mormons have also been subjected to feeling like &#8220;the other&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am not criticizing anyone for making Jews or Mormons feel like &#8220;the other&#8221;. I am just saying that it exists and sometimes it rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>Rick Perry&#8217;s campaign has managed to make both Jews and Mormons feel significantly like &#8220;the other&#8221;. First Jews at his Prayer Rally and then Mormons when a member of his staff said some not-nice things about Mormons.</p>
<p>So Mormons, we know how you feel, in more ways than one&#8230;</p>

<p>I have NOT read the book. I have read the interview.</p>
<p>The book is a study of how and why religions became part of the human experience from the perspective of social evolution. The premise is that humans need religion and this spawned religion.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not a perspective that most religious people are going to be comfortable sharing. For religious people, religion came directly from God. Not because of a human need to create religion.</p>
<p>Although, reading the interview made me think about how religions view other contemporary religions to their own and religions that preceded their own. For example, what does Judaism / Christianity / Islam / Buddhism / Hinduism / Native American religions etc. say about how the &#8220;others&#8221; practice. If each religion claims it was revealed by God then what are all those other people doing? Did God give them other instructions? Or did <em>they</em> invent their religions while <em>yours</em> is correct? Where did those religions come from if God only revealed your religion?</p>
<p>Very interesting questions.<span id="more-4524"></span></p>
<p>As for Judaism, Maimonides has a comprehensive approach to explain the existence of religions prior to Abraham and how one served God before the revelation of the Torah.</p>
<p>Briefly, God revealed to Adam some basic commandments but of primary importance was to recognize the existence of a Singular, All Powerful Creator. A few individuals were able to maintain this level of observance. But most people corrupted it and began to focus their attention to things that they viewed as &#8220;powers&#8221; such as the sun, moon, wind etc. Instead of worshipping the Creator they worshipped these &#8220;powers&#8221;. Eventually this gave way to full blown pagan religions.</p>
<p>The only monotheistic religion was the small group of people who followed Adam&#8217;s teachings. Abraham was chosen as the man from whom would grow a people who would teach this system. Eventually this became the Jewish people who got a much more complete set of instructions at Sinai.</p>
<p>Christianity and Islam are clear and direct branches off the Judaism tree.</p>
<p>We are forced to say that other religions either evolved from the original pagans who did not accept the monotheism of Adam / Abraham or that they borrowed ideas from existing Adam / Abraham monotheism. As for their claims that God revealed their religion to them through a prophet and the instructions differ from ours, there are two points. First, there is certainly room for prophecy among non-Jews but it is unlikely that a pagan would be a prophet considering the qualifications. Further, if the prophet contradicted the Torah or the Abrahamic version of monotheism we would be forced to say the prophet is a fraud.</p>
<p>Being part of a global community of religions sometimes means that we need to admit that our traditions are mutually exclusive. I think it is important and worthwhile to analyze how we deal with questions about how other religions were formed. Each religion believes it is the right one. But they cannot ignore the fact that others exist.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the presence of such questions and analyzing their answers does not prove or disprove the validity of religion in general or a specific religion in question.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gutenberg-bible.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3882" title="gutenberg-bible" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gutenberg-bible.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>There is a very prominent version of the English Bible that got a bit of a make-over week. There were some very notable changes that I think are worth some commentary.</p>
<p>How do these changes come about? About 50 scholars from all faiths have been working on this since 1994. I guess they need to agree or come to a sort of consensus. But it is interesting that 50 humans get the decision as to how words in the Bible will be translated for the next generation.</p>
<p>The scholars claim that the changes don&#8217;t really mess with the meaning of the Bible. They are just making adjustments that account for changes in language over the last few decades. For the most part these changes are needed and correct. For example, holocaust was used to describe certain sacrifices (not humans, obviously) and it has been changed to &#8220;burnt offerings&#8221;. A wise move in my opinion.<span id="more-3881"></span></p>
<p>Another good choice was changing &#8220;booty&#8221; to &#8220;spoils of war&#8221; because booty now means something completely different to most folks. (Or maybe not)</p>
<p>But the most significant change is the translation of the passage in Isaiah that supposedly foretells the virgin birth of Jesus. Believe me, I have gone at this with missionaries many times. They have always insisted that <em>Alma</em> means virgin. Well, lo and behold, the new edition correctly translates <em>Alma</em> as a &#8220;young woman&#8221;.</p>
<p>So is that it? Will missionaries stop proving the birth of a Jesus was predicted by Isaiah? Who knows.</p>
<p>And for the record, this translation DOES NOT indicate any change of stance on the virgin birth by the scholars. &#8220;None whatsoever&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well it seems hard to see how it won&#8217;t. But either way, honesty is a good thing. Accurate translations are a good thing. Hopefully missionaries will stop using that verse incorrectly to make their point.</p>
<p>Of course, sales will skyrocket for the new edition. After all, the Bible is a best seller.</p>

Hardly something ripped from the headlines. This kind of thing happens all the time. But this time, the Church has come under fire for it&#8217;s friendliness.</p>
<p>The Heartsong Church in Cordova Tennessee (it&#8217;s not named after anything Muslim, calm down) allowed the local Memphis Islamic Center to use its facilities while the Islamic Center was being renovated. Church members feel it is their duty as righteous Christians to open their doors to anyone in need. These Muslims were in need of a decent place to pray and the Church was more than willing to lend a hand.<span id="more-3824"></span></p>
<p>The two groups have a longstanding relationship and share a Thanksgiving meal each year as well. Sounds like a wonderful story to me.</p>
<p>Critics are saying that this is akin to &#8220;sleeping with the enemy&#8221;. In fact (friend of Israel) Mike Huckabee has (half in jest) compared it to showing adult films in a Church. The not in jest part of Huckabee&#8217;s statement was:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“If the purpose of a church is to push forward the gospel of Jesus Christ, and then you have a muslim group that says that Jesus Christ and all the people that follow him are a bunch of infidels who should be essentially obliterated, I have a hard time understanding that.”</em></p>
<p>Well, Mr. Huckabee allow me to explain it to you. (I&#8217;m not saying I believe this. I am saying that a religious Christian would / should believe this.) First of all, maybe the members of the Church are trying to teach the Muslims about charity and love the way Jesus tried to teach those same values to people of all faiths. That seems like a nice way to teach everyone about Jesus. Second of all, these people are friends! They are not trying to obliterate each other. They are neighbors and friends and have an existing relationship!</p>
<p>Look, Huckabee is over reacting. But I think everyone that is ignoring this story is under reacting. I don&#8217;t mean reacting to Huckabee&#8217;s inane comparisons. I mean reacting to supposed enemies getting along just fine.</p>
<p>When people are friends first and religious ideologues second (or not at all), they can be friends no matter what their beliefs. When people see others as people and foster good relationships it is hard to hate them. It&#8217;s a good thing. Isn&#8217;t this the kind of Christianity and Islam that will usher in a new era of peace among all religions?</p>
<p>I think so. And I hope that we will see more interfaith relationships among people of all backgrounds, faiths and political aspirations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tolerance.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3169" title="Tolerance" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tolerance.jpg?resize=289%2C289" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In the comment threads that follow the two posts I wrote about Esther Petrack (who has been eliminated from ANTM) (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/16/esther-petrack-modern-orthodox-jewish-girl-on-americas-next-top-model-drops-shabbos-on-television/">Esther Petrack: Modern Orthodox Jewish Girl on America’s Next Top Model Drops Shabbos on Television</a> and <a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/2010/10/19/esther-petracks-mother-speaks-esther-is-observant-it-was-all-editing/">Esther Petrack&#8217;s Mother Speaks: Esther is observant, it was all editing</a>) I noticed something that I feel needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>Much of the conversation was about whether Esther could be considered &#8220;Orthodox&#8221; or &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; in light of her decision to model. The first comment thread assumed that she dropped Shabbos (even though we knew it could be editing and my post was not about her per se) and the second thread assumed that even if she kept Shabbos there was a problem with her modeling.</p>
<p>Quite a few commenters found the need to &#8220;draw a line&#8221; between what they do and what Esther did. Some said she desecrated God&#8217;s name. Others said that violated a law and not being ashamed is enough for them to be ousted from orthodoxy or modern orthodoxy. I debated the merits of those claims on the thread (and even received a number of emails thanking me) and I don&#8217;t care to debate them further.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is this need that has been expressed to self define by whom we exclude.<span id="more-3168"></span></p>
<p>This phenomena is part of what drove the &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; laws of the first half of the 20th century. Sure blacks couldn&#8217;t be used as slaves anymore, but by excluding them from social life, and certain privileges the white majority still felt superior.</p>
<p>In politics you&#8217;ll see the same kind of lines of demarcation drawn. Someone is only as right or left wing as they are compared to the next guy. So political groups find it necessary to define themselves by who and what they are not. The last two major election campaigns (&#8217;08, &#8217;10) both focused on change. &#8220;We are not like them&#8221;.</p>
<p>In religions it is the same way. Folks want to feel superior or more authentic so they say &#8220;we are the REAL ____ [Jews / Christian / Muslims (/ Atheists)]. Huge sects of Christianity and Islam are built on this principle. Judaism is smaller and has been united by common persecution so these tendencies may have existed but it did not yield similar results.</p>
<p>Once Jews were freed from the ghetto this phenomena found its way into Judaism. Different sects within Judaism formed and people began to define themselves by whom they were not like. Most people do what their parents do. It wasn&#8217;t a conscious choice, yet they self define &#8220;real Judaism&#8221; as their version. And their version can be so narrowly construed that no one else can fit in to their little world. It&#8217;s isolationism at its best.</p>
<p>This is what many Modern Orthodox Jews find so disturbing about Charedi Judaism. The Charedi establishment excludes non-conformists. This includes in action and in thought. For example Rabbi Natan Slifkin performs the same actions / mitzvos as the Charedim. But he is excluded for his thoughts. On the other hand, those who look the part but don&#8217;t act like Charedi Jews are also excluded. For some (maybe most) this doesn&#8217;t affect them because they have self selected themselves out of the Charedi world. But for Rabbi Slifkin who self selected himself as a Charedi Jew, this created a personal conflict. Subsequent to the entire affair he self excluded himself. The merits of Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s opinions and the merits of the Charedi criticisms are not relevant. The point is that he was excluded for his thoughts.</p>
<p>Modern Orthodox Jews are more inclusive. There is a broader range of activity and thought that is acceptable. But when someone so much as tiptoes over the line they are out. Rabbi Avi Weiss dared tread just across the line and everyone and their grandmother has &#8220;excluded&#8221; him or proclaimed him to be &#8220;beyond the pale&#8221;. The truth is that Modern Orthodoxy is more inclusive but only because they have a broader definition of what is acceptable thought and action. However, going outside that self-defined perimeter means you are outside Modern Orthodoxy. There is not more tolerance, just more tolerated activity.</p>
<p>The same thing drove the comments that ousted Esther Petrack from Modern Orthodoxy. Esther&#8217;s mother wrote that her family goes &#8220;mixed swimming&#8221; (and wear bathing suits in public). This is an accepted action within Modern Orthodoxy. (Forget halacha for a minute, this is a social issue, not a halachic issue.) Yet, Esther&#8217;s modeling was outside what some people want to define as Modern Orthodoxy so she is out. Esther self defines as Modern Orthodox. Somehow people think they have a right to tell others how they are to be defined.</p>
<p>How does it help Modern Orthodox Jew be a better person or a better Jew by excluding Esther? What is the motivation?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same phenomena. People need to feel better about themselves and they take the feel good shortcut by telling themselves and others that they are better / more important / more religious / more privileged than someone else.</p>
<p>Isolating others from the place that they define as their place is self serving. Further it can hurt others. Esther is 18 years old. If you care about her as your sister and you want her to be successful professionally and more importantly, spiritually then you would be best served offering her support and reminding her that we are her family no matter what.</p>
<p>Teens who are at-risk are the darlings of the Orthodox Jewish community. Money, time, resources, blog posts and magazine articles are dedicated to solving their problems. Do we hear anyone trying to exclude them from the places they want to be included? Of course not. I am not equating at risk teens and Esther. All I am saying is that even we have come to understand that inclusion is a much more powerful tool than exclusion.</p>
<p>This is not just about Esther. It is about being inclusive. Halacha tells us how to act. It doesn&#8217;t tell us to exclude those who may not follow halacha to the standards that we arbitrarily create.</p>
<p>Above all else: V&#8217;ahavta l&#8217;reyacha kamocha, zeh klal gadol baTorah.</p>

All three religions share a reverence for Abraham. Abraham is credited with discovering monotheism. Belief in one God enabled religions to focus on action and philosophy of religion as opposed to constant appeasement of the many Gods. Thus it is not accident that Christianity, Islam and Judaism all focus on action and understanding of religion and have passed the test of time.</p>
<p>The article in the New York Times was written by<strong> Edward Rothstein</strong> who went to school with <strong>Judd Magilnick</strong> who is a member at the <strong>Pacific Jewish Center</strong>. Judd heaped high praise on the article and for good reason. The article threads a difficult needle. It recognizes that the exhibit&#8217;s focus is the commonality of the three religions while acknowledging the challenges, historic and current that the three religions face in modern times attempting to achieve a harmonious coexistence.<span id="more-3161"></span></p>
<p>The actual exhibit features some stunning artifacts. An ancient Talmud, a 13th Century Hebrew Bible, a Guggenheim Bible and a 14th Century Quran are part of the exhibit.</p>
<p>I hope I will have a chance to see this exhibit, but I don&#8217;t foresee being in New York before the end of February when the exhibit ends.</p>
<p>So, if you can get to the museum, I would love to hear what you think about the exhibit.</p>
<p>As for me, I find the current tension between these three religions beyond annoying. I would love to see more mutual understanding between members of all sects of all these faiths. I know that when it comes to tolerance and coexistence some are better and some are worse than others. But in the current era it seems completely anachronistic to be fighting holy wars that began 2000 / 1000 / 500 / 100 years ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just not worth it.</p>
<p>Exhibits like this that show the world and show us the common ground we share are important and hopefully will be a positive step towards all around tolerance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rabbi-joseph.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2855" title="rabbi joseph eisenbach" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rabbi-joseph.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Chabad of Litchfield Connecticut (Population ~8500) is trying to build a fancy new center that will house the rabbi, his family, a synagogue and a pool for the Chabad summer camp.</p>
<p>When the proposal reached the Litchfield planning board the center was denied.</p>
<p>The reasons cited by the board were mostly aesthetic. &#8220;The doors will be too big&#8221;, &#8220;The building will be a monstrosity compared to our small quaint homes&#8221;, &#8220;The Star of David may not comply with the historic district&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Fueling the tensions are claims that the opposition to the center is anti-Semitic.<span id="more-2854"></span></p>
<p>Without drawing comparisons to Park51 (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/18/ground-zero-mosque-vs-downtown-manhattan-islamic-cultural-center-video-debate/">Ground Zero Mosque vs. Downtown Manhattan Islamic Cultural Center: Video Debate</a>) or the Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Lebanon (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/15/maghen-abraham-synagogue-in-beirut-lebanon-a-symbol-of-tolerance/">Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Beirut Lebanon: A Symbol of Tolerance</a>), the issues raised in the spat are issues that go to the heart of religion in America.</p>
<p>In America, Religion is tolerated. In America, if yours is not the dominant religion, please keep to yourselves and don&#8217;t impose on the rest of us. In America, religion is okay so long as it is not &#8220;in my face&#8221;.</p>
<p>But for the dominant religion? In your face is totally fine. Prayers before sporting events, political policy in the name of &#8220;religion&#8221; and even laws that are rooted in a very specific Christian understanding of the bible are all part and parcel of the &#8220;American Experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>My opinion: Less &#8220;In Your Face&#8221; Religion from everyone would be quite welcome. Christopher Hitchens talks about the modernization of religion. This is vital to living in a world with more than one acceptanle viewpoint and especially when a competing viewpoint is right around the virtual corner. Religion can no longer be bully, it needs to place nice with the global community and respect all traditions and religions, even those who have neither.</p>
<p>I am no fan of blocking a Synagogue. Especially if and when it is fueled by anti-Semitism, but if it were me building the synagogue, I would try to fit into the aesthetic character of the community as best as I possibly could and be as unobtrusive as possible.</p>
<p>So, I choose neither side in this battle&#8230;</p>
