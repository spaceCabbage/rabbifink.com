				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6960" alt="iiTDIn4h" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/iiTDIn4h-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />There is an album of photos showing an amazing teapot on Reddit. Popchassid took the post from Reddit and turned it into a blog post. The teapot is pretty incredible. It has a bunch of compartments that hid several ritual items used in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The owner of the teapot says this about the teapot: &#8220;<em>I got this from grandfather before he died. First used by hidden Jews during the inquisition, it is shaped like a teapot, but contains many secret Judaica pieces. The Hidden Synagogue.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that there is no way this teapot dates back to the Inquisition.</p>
<p>The Inquisition was in 15th century Spain. One of the ritual items in the teapot is a dreidle. Many people are familiar with dreidle. They are a Jewish version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotum" target="_blank">teetotums</a>. Jews have played dreidle on Chanukah for at most a few hundred years. The word dreidle is Yiddish and it refers to the turning of the top.</p>
<p>Traditionally, teetotoums were played around Christmastime. That started in Eastern Europe a few centuries ago. We borrowed the game and made it work for Chanukah. No harm in that. But a tradition subsequently emerged that dreidle was played ever since the rabbis established the holiday of Chanukah. There is no evidence to support this claim.<span id="more-6959"></span></p>
<p>The Inquisition targeted Sephardic Jews. I am sure many Sephardic Jews used clever ways to disguise their practice of Judaism. It is possible that they may have used teapots to disguise their rituals. However, there is no tradition of dreidle among Sephardic Jews. There is no word for dreidle in a language other than Yiddish. Ergo, it is entirely improbable that a dreidle is in a teapot that dates back to the Inquisition.</p>
<p>My great-uncle has a boat that also has all the rituals hidden inside it. I don&#8217;t think that he claims that the boat was a disguise from persecution, I think it was just a cool way of incorporating Judaism into art. In other words, it&#8217;s possible that this teapot was not actually made or ever used to hide Jewish practices. It was an art form and it was for the sake of art.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an amazing piece of Jewish history, a true treasure. But let&#8217;s be careful to separate fact from fantasy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Jewish-Pirates.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2599" title="Jewish Pirates" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Jewish-Pirates-196x300.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="210" /></a>A little while ago I read the unfortunately mis-titled book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385513984?tag=eliyfink-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0385513984&amp;adid=08VJ6CN5645XHVXWS555&amp;">Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</a>.</p>
<p>I say unfortunately mis-titled because the book was excellent but it really was not about Jewish Pirates and certainly was not limited at all to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The book was good because it tells the story of some of the most famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converso">Converso</a> Jews following the Spanish and Porteguese Inquisition. The well footnoted text gave me a better appreciation for the 15 century Mediterranean Jews, their struggles and their success.</p>
<p>Perhaps above all, as I was reading the book I found myself with a greater appreciation for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews">Sephardi Jews</a>.<span id="more-2598"></span></p>
<p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385513984?tag=eliyfink-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0385513984&amp;adid=08VJ6CN5645XHVXWS555&amp;">Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</a> piecemeal. Every few weeks I would pick it up again and read another section. Meanwhile, in the real world, the Rubashkin saga has been dominated Jewish headlines. All the while, playing the victim card and charges of anti-Semitism in the legal system abound. The contrast of the Rubashkin campaigns and the reactions of the Conversos was striking.</p>
<p>Following decades of persecution and systematic genocide, the Jews of Spain and Portugal were forced northward. Many settled in Amsterdam. The local government tolerated the Jews but there were some blatantly anti-Jewish laws. The Jews were able to practice Judaism and in many respects they thrived there. For these refugee Jews, life was tough. It was not easy being Jewish.</p>
<p>The book follows the story of some of the Amsterdam Jews.</p>
<p>Not once, did I see a reference to &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221;. The Meditteranean Jews did not deal with their persecution by labeling it as anti-Semitism. I did not see any attempt to portray themselves as victims or the &#8220;lamb among the lions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ashkenazic Jews were also persecuted heavily. They were ousted from many countries and killed in many genocides. To cope with the hate and bloodshed, anti-Semitism was &#8220;blamed&#8221;.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. My impression of the current Sephardic Jewry landscape is very similar. I don&#8217;t recall hearing accusations of anti-Semitism when it comes to Sephardic Jews. Just last summer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Dwek">Solomon Dwek </a> was arrested on Federal charges of bank fraud. This criminal pled guilty and awaits sentencing. I did not hear a peep about any anti-Semitism in his investigation.</p>
<p>Dwek is Sephardic.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the bank fraud that Rubashkin has been charged with. I have spoke to otherwise reasonable people who are convinced the whole thing is a plot by the anti-Semitic government. They say things like &#8220;this is how it was in Germany 1935&#8243;.</p>
<p>Rubashkin is not Sephardic.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that they heritage play a role in our collective reactions.</p>
<p>On one level, it seems that Sephardic Jewry never had a culture of blaming anti-Semitism while Ashkenazik Jewry has been crying about anti-Semitism for six centuries and using the term for around 150 years. Thus, we still react differently today.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, there also exists an anto-Sephardic bias in the Ashkenazik community (see: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/06/24/somewhat-on-the-lighter-side/">Somewhat  On The Lighter Side</a>). Perhaps the Ashkenazic community does not consider anti-Jewish activity that harms Sephardic Jews &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps not. It&#8217;s just a thought.</p>
<p><em>(Either way, I recommend </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385513984?tag=eliyfink-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0385513984&amp;adid=08VJ6CN5645XHVXWS555&amp;"><em>Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</em></a><em>. It&#8217;s a fun read and I plan another post about the episode in the book that had the biggest impact on me.)</em></p>
