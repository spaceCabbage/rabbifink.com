				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7022" alt="1776" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Lag B&#8217;Omer is on Sunday. This means the entire State of Israel (and many Jewish areas around the world) will be lit with bonfires, the city of Safed and Meron will host thousands of pilgrims to the grave of R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai, schools will take their students on outings, some people will watch great rabbis shoot a bow and arrow, young boys will get their first haircuts, charity will be given for holy water, and songs will be sung to remember R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai. This is all aside from all proliferation of bogus Lag B&#8217;Omer segulos that bombard us.</p>
<p>These are all Lag B&#8217;Omer traditions that are a part of our culture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all great fun and all, and I don&#8217;t mean to rain on anyone&#8217;s parade (or bonfire) but we do need to question whether these activities are appropriate.<span id="more-7021"></span></p>
<p>Lag B&#8217;Omer is a very recent holiday. It&#8217;s not in the Mishna, Talmud, Geonim, Rishonim, Shulchan Aruch, or Rema. Because it is not found in our traditional books and sources, it is worth thinking about the contemporary celebrations of Lag B&#8217;Omer in the broad context of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>If I would tell you that there is a holiday where people make a pilgrimage to a tomb, light bonfires, dance around the fires, give money for holy water, sing songs about a great man, and make a religious ceremony out of a haircut, would you think that sounded like a traditional Jewish holiday? It wouldn&#8217;t to me. To me it sounds a bit pagan.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that it doesn&#8217;t sound familiar to the Jewish ear, because it is a new holiday which was certainly influenced by outside factors.</p>
<p>There are many halachic concerns regarding some of these practices. Just because they are done, does not mean they are right. Certainly it is possible to participate in all the Lag B&#8217;Omer fun and excitement without violating halacha. But it is not an easy task. If anyone starts to think that R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai is praying on their behalf, that could be idol worship. Or if someone venerates R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai as a spiritual power, that could be idol worship. If the haircuts at three years old at a tomb are borrowed from idol worship, it&#8217;s a problem. If giving money for holy water is a borrowed from Christianity, it&#8217;s a problem. Relying on charms and magic is a problem.</p>
<p>So you see, it&#8217;s not so simple to celebrate the new holiday of Lag B&#8217;Omer.</p>
<p>But the most important question we have to ask ourselves is why are we celebrating Lag B&#8217;Omer in this manner? How did this happen? How did it come to be that a holiday which was invented in the last few hundreds years has become a very religiously significant event? So much so that people will read this post and wonder if I am orthodox? How did this happen?</p>
<p>And one last question: Should R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai really be our biggest rabbinic hero? See this post on DovBear for more that: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/05/mitzvoth-not-magic-or-what-about-r.html">Mitzvoth not magic: Or what about R. Yehuda?</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but I don&#8217;t think we will like the answer if we ever find out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tours_maimonides_tomb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5515" title="tours_maimonides_tomb" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tours_maimonides_tomb-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>An article in Haaretz caught my eye.</p>
<p>Maimonides was a hyper-rationalist. He did not believe in mysticism and fought vehemently against it. One aspect of mysticism is praying at tombs of holy people. Yet, for hundreds of years people have made pilgrimage to Tiberias in the north of Israel to pay respect a the grave of Maimonides and pray at his tomb.</p>
<p>Compared with other holy sites, the tomb of Maimonides is in need of renovations and a facelift. A $10 million project will spruce up the tomb and make it more inviting for visitors.</p>
<p>The problem is that Maimonides himself felt strongly that one should not make a grave into a holy site.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Donniel Hartmann paraphrased the words of Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah:  &#8221;For holy men, no headstones should be built on their graves because their words are their memory&#8230; and people should not visit graves.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty clear that Maimonides would not be in favor of this renovation or visitors to his tomb.<span id="more-5512"></span></p>
<p>So is it ironic? Or a chutzpah?</p>
<p>It feels similar to Mormons baptizing Jews. It&#8217;s one religious group using their beliefs in an ironic way. Jews don&#8217;t believe in Jesus so we don&#8217;t really care for the Baptism. But Mormons feel like they are doing us a favor. Similarly, Maimonides didn&#8217;t believe in praying at grave sites, but mystics probably feel like they are doing him a favor by praying at his site even though they must think that he was wrong about the whole not praying at grave sites thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find it amusing.</p>
<p>I saved this post for International Jewish Mysticism Day (otherwise known as Lag B&#8217;Omer) to lodge a tiny rationalist counterbalance against the overwhelming mysticism of the day. That is my way of being ironic.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h2>Parshas Emor</h2>
<h2>U’shmartem V’asissem</h2>
<p>In parshas Emor (22:32), we are warned, v’lo sichalalu es shem kadshi, not to create a chilul Hashem. Furthermore, the passuk challenges us, v’nikdashi bisoch yisrael, to create a kiddush Hashem in all our endeavors. A simple passuk, but seemingly a tall order, to live lives al kiddush Hashem. While we are aware of the spiritual adrenaline that gave strength to those who gave up their lives al kiddsuh Hashem, we know that it is equally as important, and much more difficult, to live our lives b’kedushas Hashem each and every day. Fortunately, the limud of smichos haparshiyos, or in this case smichos hapassukim, shows us how.<span id="more-2427"></span></p>
<p>In the passuk preceding the commandment to be mikadesh shem shamayim we are told “u’shmartem mitzvosai v’asissem osam,” watch the mitzvos and perform them. Interestingly, Chazal do not interpret this passuk as a warning, u’shmartem, to behave, rather Toras kohanim explains u’shamartem zu mishna, v’asissem zu ha’maaseh, melamed she kol sheayno bmishna ano b’maaseh. In other words, the only way to be shomer Torah u’mitzvos properly is to learn, for those who don’t know, can’t do. Moreover, those who don’t live al pi Torah in any aspect of their character, reflect the notion that they have not learned properly to begin with. Indeed, there is no way to be mekadesh shem shamayim if one does not know how to act in the manner prescribed by Torah in every given situation.</p>
<p>In this context, it is clear that learning is the most important ingredient in our growing into being the ohr la’amim we are intended to be. This creates a quandary, for this adage that learning is everything seems to conflict with the mishna in Avos that tells us ain hamedresh haikar ela ha’maaseh, that our performance is everything and our learning is secondary.</p>
<p>Of course, this question is really the result of a superficial understanding of the ratzon Hashem. After all, another mishna in Avos tells us, ain am haaretz chasid. What we are being taught is that there is supposed to be a constant interplay between our learning and our actions. V’talmud Torah keneged kulam and derech ertz kadma l’Torah are not meant to be conflicting values, rather limud haTorah is not only to be the driving force in our intellectual knowledge but in the outgrowth of the behavior that it demands from the very begining. Learning well and behaving poorly can never go hand in hand, rather as the passukim in the parsha teach us when we fulfill the dictum of u’shmartem mitzvosai v’asissem osam, we will be zoche to not be of those who are mechalel shem kadsho, but rather we will mekadash His name besoch shaar Yisrael.</p>
<p>This is a vital yesod in anticipation of our appreciating the impending arrival of Lag B’Omer and our personal preparation for the Yom Tov of Shavous. Rabbi Akiva’s talmidim surely fulfilled the essence of u’shmartem but Chazal are maeid that there was a lacking in their va’asisem, and 24,000 perished. To live a life of v’nikdashi, it is vital that we focus our commitment to u’shmartem v’asissem &#8211; to learn and to perform His will in our every action. Committing ourselves to this concept gives the ultimate meaning to our kabolas haTorah and assures that we can function as a mamleches kohanim v’goy kadosh for all to emulate.</p>
