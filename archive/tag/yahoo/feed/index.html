				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/liar.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7257" alt="liar" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/liar-300x292.jpg" width="300" height="292" /></a>One of the primary concerns in the orthodox Jewish community when discussing the issue of reporting sex abuse to the authorities is that inevitably there will be false accusations that will ruin the lives of innocent people. It is very scary to think that someone can be named as an abuser and before any evidence is presented the accused can be found guilty in the court of public opinion. In a community where the main currency is reputation and communal standing false accusations can have drastic consequences.</p>
<p>This is a good reason not to judge people before the facts are known and also a good argument against placing too much stock in reputation. Changing our approach on these issues would go a long way to making our communities safer places.</p>
<p>Whether concern over false accusations is a legitimate reason to require rabbinic approval before going to the authorities is a discussion for another time. I don&#8217;t see why should be any different than other non-orthodox Jewish communities, but again, not the discussion here.</p>
<p>The NY Times has a very (appropriately) one-sided article on the Baruch Lebovits and Sam Kellner situation.<span id="more-7256"></span> In short, Lebovits is a known sex abuser, he molested Kellner&#8217;s son, Kellner got permission from a rabbinic court to pursue Lebovits in criminal proceedings, and Lebovits was convicted. Kellner was a hero and symbol of strength in the victims advocates community. Then Kellner was convicted of obstruction for allegedly offering money for testimony and threatening to extort Lebovitz&#8217;s family. Kellner was charged and to add insult to injury, Lebovits&#8217;s conviction was overturned. He awaits retrial.</p>
<p>The Times quotes a rabbi who advised Kellner to go to the authorities as saying that if Kellner goes to jail it will have the effect of preventing future victims from coming forward. It&#8217;s hard enough to come forward in the community but it will be even harder if a strong advocate for victims of abuse finds himself in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>The merits of Kellner&#8217;s case notwithstanding, I think it could be argued that a conviction of Kellner would have the opposite effect. If one concern with reporting abuse to the authorities is the fear of false accusations, it is possible that seeing Kellner&#8217;s troubles with the law could mitigate this fear. Clearly, the law does not take kindly to those who are deceptive or dishonest when reporting allegations of abuse. Thus it stands to reason that we need not be terribly concerned that false allegations would occur frequently.</p>
<p>The Brian Banks case illustrates this same idea. Banks was a rising college football star when he plead guilty to rape. The accuser admitted to lying after Banks sat in jail for several years. Banks was released and now his accuser is being sued for millions of dollars. She will probably lose too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that Banks was falsely accused and proponents of rabbinic go-betweens might point to the case to show how dangerous it can be to just go to the authorities without an independent investigation. However, the fact that the false accuser stands to lose millions of dollars in civil court, not to mention possible criminal prosecution actually serves as a huge deterrent. Certainly these kinds of consequences to false accusations will serve as a barrier to future false accusations.</p>
<p>The point is that false accusations happen from time to time. But when they do happen there are severe consequences. It&#8217;s unlikely that people would be willing to risk suffering those severe consequences when there is no basis for their accusation. We should not be afraid that these stories will chill allegations of abuse in our community. We should use these stories as examples of the fidelity of the criminal justice system and hopefully our community will encourage victims of abuse to come forward without being overly concerned with false accusations so that we can get to fixing this problem as quickly as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TheUnionisDissolved.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6466" title="TheUnionisDissolved" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TheUnionisDissolved-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" /></a>If your candidate loses the election you have three choices. You can grin and bear it, move to another country, or secede from the Union. I have not heard of anyone actually getting up and leaving the United States of America in the wake of the election, and I am sure if someone does leave purely for political reasons we will hear about it. Though I wonder where a libertarian of conservative would enjoy living more than in these United States. Is there a country out there with more conservative / liberal balance than America? I don&#8217;t think so. But I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Of course, this is part of the blessing of America. There is always a balance. There are some states that are more liberal than others. There are some states with more conservative values than others. Put it all together and you get an odd mix of values, opinions, and policies that create a great country unlike any other.</p>
<p>The White House has a petition website where one can petition the government for just about anything. If you get 25,000 signatures on your petition, the government guarantees a response. There are now 20 petitions from 20 states requesting that the Federal government allow them to peacefully secede from the United States of America so that they can form their own little country.<span id="more-6465"></span></p>
<p>Aside from the logistical problems of turning a state into a country and the oft ignored fact that the Federal government gives millions of dollars to the states, conservatives and liberals would be wise to oppose these shenanigans.</p>
<p>First of all, asking to secede after losing an election is the very definition of being a sore loser. It&#8217;s like the kid who takes his ball home after his team loses and doesn&#8217;t let the next team play.</p>
<p>But it is much more than that. Part of what America great is the diversity of its population. We are a nation of immigrants and though we Americans do not share a common ancestry or heritage we share common dreams. We pride ourselves on the great opportunity that awaits the huddled masses from wherever they come.</p>
<p>One of the great checks and balances built into our country is the political system where conservatives and liberals and everyone in between has a voice in government and ideally our government represents the best of both sides of the spectrum.</p>
<p>It would be a disaster if our country lost its great diversity and political balance due to secession. Now I know that these petitions are silly and reactionary. But I just think that if we would appreciate our country for what it is, we would not see attempts to secede after losing an election. We need to be proud of our system and if we want to change things but have been rebuffed we need to adjust strategy or tactics, not take our ball and run away.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about Jewish institutions. The Jewish people are also a nation of immigrants and huddled masses. Although in contrast to America, we do share common ancestry and heritage which makes us even more connected to one another. Part of what makes us great is our diversity. We are proud that there are so many different kinds of Jews. People to the left of us and people to the right of us may disagree on substance and style, but we are still brothers and sisters. For that reason alone we must do everything we can to identify with one another. We cannot afford secessions. Debate, dispute, disagreement, dialogue &#8211; those we can handle. But we cannot tolerate a group seceding from Judaism nor can we ostracize a group so much that we create a secession by default.</p>
<p>Our differences are our strength. It&#8217;s not easy to understand or empathize with people on the opposite of an ideology. But it is the sign of strength, not weakness, when we do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ht_loch_ness_creature_inset_nt_120814_wmain.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6173" title="ht_loch_ness_creature_inset_nt_120814_wmain" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ht_loch_ness_creature_inset_nt_120814_wmain-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></a>We&#8217;ve all heard of the Loch Ness Monster. Nessie is in the hall of fame of mythological creatures alongside Bigfoot, Chupacabra, Kraken, Werewolves, and Vampires. Supposedly, Nessie lives in giant loch in Scotland. According to the legends, Nessie is a giant sea monster the likes of which are not known to scientists anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Rational people reject the existence of Nessie based on the lack of evidence that Nessie is real. The only &#8220;evidence&#8221; available is a few grainy photographs that could be just about anything, some anecdotes, legends, and faith. It is fair to say that belief in Nessie is irrational and not supported by science.</p>
<p>A Scottish Sailor named George Edwards claims to have the best photo of Nessie yet. This Edwards fellow has been chasing Nessie every day for 26 years. He thinks his photograph (see above) captures one of many Nessie sea monsters living in the Loch.</p>
<p>It is hard to see how this photo can be anything definitive. But I guess the eyes start playing tricks on you and your mind agrees with your eyes after a 26 year search.</p>
<p>What fascinated me more than anything about the article on Yahoo! was this section:<span id="more-6152"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Edwards has a lot of theories about the Loch Ness monster, which he first became fascinated with when he was a 13-year-old boy and his father would take him fishing at the massive lake. He says he was a skeptic at first, but decades on Loch Ness have turned him into an ardent believer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I grew up with the legend, like the boogeyman, or Big Foot in your part of the world, and most people start out thinking it’s a myth,” Edwards said. “But Loch Ness is so deep and dark and mysterious, when you start hearing more and more stories, you start believing more.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He says his wife, who has been with him since before he started searching for Nessie full time, was initially a skeptic too, but after years of hearing stories from her husband and others, “she came around, and she’s a believer now.”</p>
<p>What Edwards is saying is that a skeptic can become a believer if one is immersed in an environment conducive to that belief. Rationality and reason are not strong enough to prevail over immersion in a society where belief is central.</p>
<p>Ain&#8217;t that the truth&#8230;</p>
<p>As if the bring the point home, I noticed the post on Collive about the Atheist woman who became a devout Chabad chasid. Here is a woman who says that she was a devout Atheist. Science, reason, logic, and rationalism were her Gods. Then something clicked and she found her Creator and Tanya and Chabad. Now she is a Chabad chasid married to an aspiring Chabad rabbi.</p>
<p>What? How did this happen?</p>
<p>Well it happens all the time. Kiruv is pretty successful, especially on college campuses. I was part of it myself for a couple of years and some of my students are now orthodox. It&#8217;s not a strange story at all. Yet it seems improbable. How does it happen?</p>
<p>There are a lot of factors. Not the least of which is a yearning for a sense of belonging to a community that has what a lot of people are searching for. But yet, that can&#8217;t be enough to circumvent one&#8217;s firmly held beliefs about science and reason. Or can it?</p>
<p>I think Sailor Edwards has given us some really good insight into how this happens. If you are in an environment where everyone believes in something, and there is a payoff to that belief, it becomes much easier to believe. A skeptic can believe in Nessie, or an Atheist can believe in God and Torah and Judaism.</p>
<p>There is a huge difference between the two. I don&#8217;t think there is any value in believing in Nessie. I do think that there is a lot of value in believing in God.</p>
<p>One might argue that if belief runs counter to reason, why would it be wise or useful to place oneself in an environment conducive to belief? Isn&#8217;t that just fooling oneself into believing in God? My response is that many people <em>want </em>to believe. It is just <em>hard</em> to believe. If one wants to believe and they are conflicted about their beliefs, it is wise to do whatever one can do to reinforce those beliefs. Immersion in a community where belief is common and has a payoff seems to be a great solution.</p>
<p>The challenge of our generation of orthodox Judaism is belief. I think it is a legitimate struggle. One tool in the arsenal of the believer is to immerse oneself in a community of believers. We think our beliefs are legitimate. It worked for a sailor looking for an imaginary creature, it could work for those of us who are looking for our Creator.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120127-0847151.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5081" title="20120127-084715.jpg" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120127-0847151-300x181.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="181" /></a>Last Sunday, two NFL teams advanced to the Super Bowl. Two other teams lost and were sent home for the winter.</p>
<p>One of the notable things about both games was the lack of heroes for the winning teams. Instead of the winning teams making a great play to win the game, both of the losing teams made mistakes that gave the game away. Instead of heroes we had goats.</p>
<p>In the first game, the Ravens made three consecutive heartbreakingly poor plays. First a dropped touchdown, then a bad pass when the quarterback could have run for a few yards and then a missed field goal from close range. The players who made the biggest mistakes, the receive who dropped the pass and the kicker who missed the kick lost the game for their team. Or at least it appears that way to the observer. Obviously mistakes in the beginning of the game are just as costly as mistakes at the end of the game. Yet, we somehow place greater emphasis on the glaring mistakes at the end of the game.</p>
<p>In our house we are fans of the Ravens. It was shocking and disappointing to see them lose in this fashion. Especially so, for my eight year old son. He was upset as I am sure millions of other Ravens fans across the country.</p>
<p>The second game featured an even worse anti-hero. Kyle Williams fumbled the ball twice in crucial kick return situations. He gave the ball back to the Giants and cost his tea the game. It was heartbreaking for him and for 49ers fans everywhere. It was his fault that the Giants won and people were really mad at him.</p>
<p><span id="more-5082"></span></p>
<p>Some people sent him <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/49ers/2012/01/23/kyle-williams-receiving-death-threats-after-nfc-championship/">death threats.</a>. Others just said horrible things about him. One seven year old boy was also upset after seeing Williams give away the game.</p>
<p>He was crying &#8220;but&#8230; why&#8230; did&#8230; he have to fumble?!&#8221;</p>
<p>His father replied, &#8220;if you are so upset, how do you think he feels?&#8221;</p>
<p>To which the boy responded by asking if he could write a letter to Kyle Williams to &#8220;make him feel better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is what the kid wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dear Mr. Williams:</em></p>
<p>We just watched the Playoff game. I feel really bad for you but I wanted to tell you that you had a great season. you sould be very proud, so I wanted to say thank you.</p>
<p>I am your #1 FAN!</p>
<p>Owen Shure<br />
Los Angeles, CA</p>
<p>p.s. your awsome</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>You gotta love this kid. But even more than the kid, I think you gotta love the father!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure he was upset too. Most people who invest time into sports are somewhat affected by wins and losses. All the more so a heart wrenching loss like the one suffered by the Niners on Sunday. This father used it as a great teaching moment for himself and his son. Athletes are people too. They make mistakes and it hurts them when they make mistakes.</p>
<p>The anger towards athletes when they don&#8217;t live up to our lofty expectations can cause people to do stupid things. They write death threats and forget that their sports heroes have feelings too.</p>
<p>No one feels worse than the goats of these big games. Hatred and anger towards them is immature and misguided.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rest of country has to deal with another championship that will be decided between teams from New York and Boston. That&#8217;s something to get upset about! (Just kidding.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lebron_money.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2378" title="lebron_money" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lebron_money.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="239" /></a>The NBA Playoffs are here. That means 10 weeks of sporadic games until someone takes home the Larry O&#8217;Brien Trophy and gets to spritz champagne all over themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, the &lt;sarcasm&gt; Supreme King Master of the Basketball Universe, His Royal Heiness LeBron James is expected to win it all and take his team to the &#8220;Promised Land&#8221; and we will all fawn all over his super-human ability and charisma &lt;end sarcasm&gt;. That is until he reminds us that it is all about the money in the off-season, because LeBron is a free agent this summer.</p>
<p>I have had my criticisms of LeBron in the past. <span id="more-2377"></span>In <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/">Athletes as Role Models?</a> I reminded everyone that athletes are just athletes. They are not people worth looking up to. And in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/21/teamwork-important-in-sports-more-important-in-life/">Teamwork: Important in Sports, More Important in Life</a> I pointed out that for an athlete who is supposed to be such a team player, the video of LeBron with his teammates disappearing is a conflicting (and wrong) message.</p>
<p>The latest gripe I have with LeBron is even more serious. LeBron owns a marketing company call LRMR. In the NBA a marketing company is a conglomorate that tries to woo potential clients from the college ranks to sign with them to represent the athlete&#8217;s interest. The agency will market the player as a commodity to teams to negotiate salary as well to corporations to contract endorsement deals.</p>
<p>The business is shady enough as it is. College athletes are not allowed to accept payment or gifts. Marketing agencies will use 3rd parties to win over athletes in the hope that the 3rd party will control which agency the athlete chooses. Is it legal? probably. Nevertheless, it is definitiely shady. But when an athlete, especially an athlete with the influence of LeBron enters the fray, what was shady is now borderline unethical. If an athlete controls other athlete&#8217;s decisions by controlling their contract negotionations and endorsement deals, that is a level of control that is, in my view, wrong.</p>
<p>But maybe LeBron is such a sterling character that he would never dream of using his influence to contol athletes?</p>
<p>Sorry, but <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-lebronwall041310" target="_blank">according to this Yahoo News item</a>, LeBron is already working his magic on the most highyl touted NBA prospect since LeBron, John Wall.</p>
<p>Just another reason I don&#8217;t like LeBron&#8230;</p>

<p>This morning two web items gave me the boost I needed and I want to share them with you. Perhaps they will entertain you as much as me!</p>
<p>I always check out the Yahoo.com homepage for a variety of news stories. They&#8217;re usually a day or two behind (that is always worth a chuckle) and oftentimes they sensationalize stories beyond reason. Other times they are very telling indicators of the pulse of America. This morning I took a screen shot of a very telling headline.<span id="more-1816"></span></p>
<p>Only in America in 2009 does a faux reality star&#8217;s fame equate the fame of the First Lady. Yes, it is true, &#8220;Tough Year for Famous Moms&#8221; includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Gosselin" target="_blank">Kate Gosselin</a> and right next to her, Michelle Obama. It makes me laugh even as I type it!</p>
<p>Even worse is the implicit equation of their challenges. One is challenged because she exposed her life and her children&#8217;s life in search of fame with no redeeming value whatsoever. The other, is the most influential person in the most powerful person&#8217;s life and her challenges are not related to fame seeking, rather the realities of trying to maintain a sane lifestyle amid the ruckus of the White House. She tries to minimize her family&#8217;s exposure, while Kate tries to maximize her exposure.</p>
<p>Oh, Yahoo.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1818" href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/10/two-things-that-made-me-smile-this-morning/famous-moms/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1818" title="famous moms" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/famous-moms1.jpg" alt="famous moms" width="614" height="473" /></a></p>
<p>The second is a hilarious bit from <a href="http://improveverywhere.com/" target="_blank">Improv Everywhere.</a> (The guys who did the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwMj3PJDxuo&amp;feature=SeriesPlayList&amp;p=9C5623622606791F">Grand Central Video</a>, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utkkXCF8ZVc" target="_blank">Best Buy Video</a>, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkYZ6rbPU2M&amp;feature=SeriesPlayList&amp;p=9C5623622606791F" target="_blank">Food Court Video</a> &#8211; watch them all.)</p>
<p>They filmed one their own getting lost at a Knicks game. The fans at the game were not in on the joke and were cheering and rooting for the lost fan to find his seat more than they cheered for the Knicks.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie" target="_blank">Ball Don&#8217;t Lie</a>: As <a href="http://nbaoffseason.com/post/263909662/this-is-genius-apparently-knicks-games-are-so" target="_blank">NBA Off-Season</a> so eloquently put it: &#8220;Leave it to improv theatre actors to get Knicks fans off their seats and chanting, if not even for their own team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hahahaha!</p>
