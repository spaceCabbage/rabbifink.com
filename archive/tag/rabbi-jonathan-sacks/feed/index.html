				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was invited to join Rabbi Shafran to talk about recent comments by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and the subsequent response by the Agudah. We discussed it on Facebook on Friday and I guess Zev or one of his producers saw the comment thread and decided to ask me onto the show. The format of the show was to be a moderated discussion between Rabbi Shafran and me.<span id="more-7357"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran represented the Agudah position. I represented the non-Agudah position.<img class="size-medium wp-image-7358 alignright" alt="old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The gist of Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s argument was that Rabbi Sacks was criticizing a legitimate form of orthodox Judaism and was doing so from a place of ignorance as evidenced by his mention of the Siyum HaShas as an example of inward turning segregationism. Thus, the Agudah was standing up for themselves and the more insular communities who were criticized.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the Agudah over reacted. Rabbi Sacks was not even criticizing the insular communities as much as he was warning of a potential danger if the trend to the right continues. In his view, and in mine, there is a lot of value in a version of Judaism that sympathizes with orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Judaism should be careful not to eliminate this soft center between non-orthodox Judaism and orthodox Judaism. While the choice of the Siyum HaShas was unfortunate, I don&#8217;t think it accurately reflected his sentiments.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Rabbi Sacks meant, this is an important discussion and I invited Rabbi Shafran and the radio audience to have that discussion. While it is entertaining to argue about what Rabbi Sacks was trying to say, it is far less important than the substance his point.</p>
<p>Listen to the show below. I&#8217;ve cut the 2 hour show into 1:20 of just talking. So no ads or news will disturb your listening. The quality of the recording is pretty brutal but this was what I received from the producer.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6703" alt="jonathan-sacks" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jonathan-sacks-300x172.jpg" width="300" height="172" />In yesterday&#8217;s New York Times, Rabbi Sacks is a featured Op-Ed contributor. His article, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/opinion/the-moral-animal.html" target="_blank">The Moral Animal</a> has been at the top of the Most Emailed and near the top of the Most Viewed lists for a couple days now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beautifully written article. I think Rabbi Sacks is really onto something here. He basically argues that the survival of good, kind, compassionate religion is a function of a quasi-evolution. We are hard wired for empathy and altruism. But we are also hard wired to survive and act selfishly. Religion functions as a way of helping us maintain balance or even tip the scales in favor of empathy and altruism.</p>
<p>He uses some fancy neuroscience to support his premise and I am certainly not qualified to comment on that aspect of the article.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sacks concludes that &#8220;religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age&#8221; and we cannot allow the West to &#8220;lose their sense of God&#8221;. Rabbi Sacks is correct that good religion is good for society. We need to foster and promote that kind of religion. Kind, compassionate, caring about everyone and greasing the wheels of humanity to push the world forward. Sometimes religion does the opposite of that. Rabbi Sacks is trying to showcase the softer, more humanistic side of religion and I support that completely. We need to emphasize that kind of religion in our religious communities and in the public eye.<span id="more-6702"></span></p>
<p>Also, as <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2012/12/25/nothing-to-be-nervous-about-neuroscience/" target="_blank">Rabbi Adlerstein pointed out</a>, there is no fear of science detectable in Rabbi Sacks&#8217; article. Everything science teaches us can be used to glorify God and increase our appreciation for the world God gave us.</p>
<p>I really like the article and only have one small complaint.</p>
<p>I wish that Rabbi Sacks would open the door for non-believers to be included in his article. In other words, Rabbi Sacks is implying that those without religion are doomed because their selfishness is bound to control them and eventually it could control and ultimately destroy society.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we need to be so apocalyptic.</p>
<p>The mission of the Jewish People is to be a light to the nations. I think it is fallacious to assume that this requires everyone to be religious or Christian, or Muslim, Hindu, or even Jewish. It means that the lessons of good, empathetic, progressive religion are universal and should become the standard for the entire world. But with good religious people leading the way, it is not necessary for everyone else to be religious to  integrate those important lessons. Good, kind, atheists also need to be part of the conversation.</p>
<p>We should be saying something very similar to what Rabbi Sacks is saying, but a little bit broader. We should be saying that all people must find ways to develop their empathy and altruism. If religion is your path, that&#8217;s great. If you choose another path, that is also fine. Our primary concern is not the religious choices or observances, but that the lessons and strength of good religion should not become extinct. It&#8217;s clear that non-religious people will be a huge part of the future and I think it is a mistake to exclude them from this conversation.</p>
<p>I love Rabbi Sacks&#8217; message, I just think it needs to be a bit broader.</p>
<p><em>Stay tuned tomorrow for a post that investigates this issue a bit further.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6262" title="sacks" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>I deeply admire Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks. It is with great interest that I watched his BBC Television program on Science vs. Religion. I really enjoyed it, but found it a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>The premise is that Rabbi Sacks is on a mission to open dialogue with premier British scientists. The production value is high and it is an enjoyable program. (Although I can&#8217;t for the life of me understand why the YouTube video is not in HD and appears squished.) The show is from his perspective. This means that it edited and cut to his liking. This is fine, but it severely limits the objectivity of the show.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch intelligent people talking about important things, but clearly the content is dumbed down for a broad audience.<span id="more-6261"></span></p>
<p>The best segment is the Richard Dawkins segment. Rabbi Sacks challenges Dawkins and Dawkins challenges the Rabbi. Neither of them really answer each other&#8217;s questions. It&#8217;s a little frustrating to the viewer who actually wants to see highly intelligent people debate.</p>
<p>But the value in this video lies not only in the actual questions and answers, its value lies in the acknowledgement that there are questions that science cannot answer and that there are questions that religion cannot answer.</p>
<p>The one thing that bothered me in watching this video how many times scientists challenged Rabbi Sacks about the &#8220;truth&#8221; of Torah and religion and Rabbi Sacks did not answer them with a clear response. I don&#8217;t know if he has a clear response, but there was none in the video.</p>
<p>But there was much to like.</p>
<p>I like how Dawkins differentiates between Darwinism to explain our existence and his refusal to use Social Darwinism to create society. I loved how Rabbi Sacks pounces on this as a way of showing that bad science can be just as damaging as bad religion. Then Rabbi Sacks uses Dawkins&#8217; response to this to show that there is common ground between Religion and Science in that we all share certain values and in those areas we should work together to ensure those mutual goals are met and not foiled by bad religion or bad science. Dawkins is even willing to work together toward common goals.</p>
<p>How many times have I said the same kind of thing with regard to atheism, other religions, secular Judaism, progressive religious Judaism and traditional religious Judaism? I agree with this vehemently. There are many problems that plague us all. Many of the solutions to those problems can be found in religion and science.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sacks ends the program with a soliloquy on the &#8220;power of the conversation&#8221;. This is my mantra as well. The Internet is a place to have that conversation but it must carry over to world of human interaction. We need to enable this kind of conversation as much as we possibly can.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that we need to have the same conversation about science and religion. I mean that we need to have conversations between all of humankind on matters upon which we agree. Those areas are so broad and vast and in those areas we can all contribute. The secular world has much to learn from religion and its values. Religion has much to gain from science. Let&#8217;s not allow our differences to get in the way of progress for mankind.</p>
<p>As we begin a new Jewish year, let us commit to opening dialogue between all people of faiths and creeds for a better tomorrow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/choir_logo.jpeg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5118" title="choir_logo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/choir_logo.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="141" /></a>Yesterday I had the privilege of attending a historic event. The new building of a synagogue in Los Angeles, to be more precise, North Beverly Hills, opened its doors for the first time. Young Israel of North Beverly Hills dedicated their new shul at an inspiring ceremony.</p>
<p>Founding President of Pacific Jewish Center, Michael Medved was the Master of Ceremonies for a speaking lineup that included members of congress and local government. The keynote address was magnificently delivered by Chief Rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful event and a ceremony befitting such an auspicious day.</p>
<p>The highlight for me was the live performance by the Shabbaton Choir. They sang several stirring songs and had the crowd buzzing. They were phenomenal. Their style is a mix of cantorial and chamber music that is not often associated with Jewish music. Most people think of Klezmer music as the Jewish music standard. Others, from Sephardic backgrounds think of middle-eastern music as Jewish music. Orthodox Jews in the 21st century think of the pseudo-pop-rock Jewish music as Jewish music.</p>
<p>The Shabbaton Choir has a different take. It is a beautiful take too.<span id="more-5114"></span></p>
<p>Here is one song they sang yesterday that I really loved.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1jsseGcvVrw?start=36" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>As you can see and hear, this is not typical Jewish music by any commonly held definition of Jewish music.</p>
<p>I think there is a unique quality to this kind of music that is lacking in the other forms of Jewish music, at least to my ears. This certainly applies to the pseudo-pop-rock version of music that is most prevalent in orthodox circles. The other Jewish music is mostly marketed as an alternative to non-Jewish music. It&#8217;s entertainment. The music is designed to distract, keep one busy, lighten a mood, or inspire. The music does not feel like an end to itself, rather it is a means to some other purpose. That&#8217;s fine. I have no problem with it and I even enjoy it from time to time (-usually the older stuff).</p>
<p>But Shabbaton is doing something different, at least that&#8217;s how it feels to me. They are using the music as worship. The music is not being used to inspire. It is the act of singing that is fulfilling a need to serve God. In other words, the singing is for its own sake. To sing. The music is uplifting, but I don&#8217;t think that is their purpose. I think they are singing as an act of praise to serve and love God. That&#8217;s very different.</p>
<p>It reminded me of something I wrote about here: <a title="Permanent link to Book Review | Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Geniza" href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/17/book-review-sacred-trash-the-lost-and-found-world-of-the-cairo-geniza/" rel="bookmark">Book Review | Sacred Trash</a></p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, Jews have developed various social ways of expressing themselves as they worship God. [Please read what I wrote in <a title="Permanent link to Book Review | Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Geniza" href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/17/book-review-sacred-trash-the-lost-and-found-world-of-the-cairo-geniza/" rel="bookmark">Book Review | Sacred Trash</a> in the last couple of paragraphs for a fuller explanation of this idea.] The Shabbaton Choir is using their song in this manner. Their singing is like the Talmud study of the yeshiva student or the meditations of the chasid. I love the idea of singing as worship and I love the perfect execution of this idea by the Shabbaton choir.</p>
<p>It is a joy to experience first hand. I encourage you to experience it for yourself as well. Their music is available on iTunes and they have some videos on YouTube.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/london-riots-fire.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4527" title="london-riots-fire" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/london-riots-fire-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215" /></a>Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks published a lovely op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. The article attempts to explain the underlying reasons for the horrible riots in London. As always, Rabbi Sacks is articulate, passionate and well-reasoned.</p>
<p>However, in this case I think the good rabbi is mistaken. At leasts to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sacks makes the claim that the depreciating value system in the UK is the source of the problem that gave rise to the riots. In particular, the eroding of Judeo-Christian values in Britain has created an environment which spawns a litany of social problems.</p>
<p>I agree that the social problems are one of the things that can cause riots. They are not the only consideration.<span id="more-4526"></span> Economic woes are also a huge factor. When people are bored, have no job to look forward to, they are more likely  to engage in anti-social behavior. Sure, one can also try to wedge the unemployment issues around the world into a failed allegiance to Judeo-Christian values. I know I have heard similar assertions. But I believe that is a bit far-fetched. Religious societies, have recessions. Even (believe it or not) the &#8220;free market&#8221; also allows for recessions in the economy. Permanent growth is impossible.</p>
<p>The problem I have with the article is that it ignores all the mobs and riots throughout history that certainly were rooted in Judeo-Christian values. Or the mobs and riots in predominantly religious neighborhoods. Or the thousands of years of killing in the name of religion.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that this riot should have a different cause than all the riots before the decay of the Judeo-Christian values in Britain.</p>
<p>Further, there are many wonderful societies not based on Jude0-Christian values where, I know this is going to sound shocking, there are not violent riots.</p>
<p>I believe that there are equally compelling arguments for good social behavior from a non-religious perspective. One problem, in my opinion, is that the religious people view the non-religious as heathens and the &#8220;enemy&#8221;. This creates a hostile social environment. There are universal values that we agree upon. The issues upon which we disagree should not create the discord and anger that they do.</p>
<p>Religious and non-religous people all agree that riots are bad. Honesty and peace are universal good values. There is no reason to make this a religious issue.</p>
<p>Perhaps most bothersome to me about the article is that similar hooligans in the USA who are gang members certainly express themselves as religious. They wear crosses, they get crosses and other religious symbols tattooed into their skin, many attend church as well. It is simply unfair to paint rioters with an anti-Judeo-Christian brush.</p>
<p>In short: Rabbi Sacks assumes 3 things that I think are faulty assumptions. First, the reason for the riots is the decay of Judeo-Christian values. Second, that Judeo-Christian values &#8220;prevent&#8221; rioting. Finally, that rioters do not identify with Judeo-Christian values.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I loved the article.</p>
