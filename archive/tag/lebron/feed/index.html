				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5680" title="good-job-blue-ribbon" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon-217x300.png" alt="" width="217" height="300" /></a>After the Celtics defeated the Heat in Game 5 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals in what will surely be remembered as a disastrous game for LeBron, Wade, and company something managed to distract the public from the actual game. As Shane Battier and Ronny Turiaf exited the court through the tunnel the very loud, high pitched voice of a child pierced through the depressing noise of the arena.</p>
<p>While millions of people were watching the dejected Heat hang their heads in shame, one young fan&#8217;s voice pierced through the airwaves with an inspirational message. &#8220;Good job!&#8221; Good effort!&#8221; he cried. His team had just suffered a horrible loss, he must have been in pain, but he rose above it all to give his favorite players a bit of hope and positive reinforcement as they left the court.<span id="more-5678"></span></p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s name is Jack Meyer and he 9 years old. He has been a fan of the Heat since he was 3 or 4 years old and he must have been really upset after that loss. But he probably plays sports in a league and when his team loses or is getting outplayed his coaches probably shout out the same refrain. &#8220;Good job! Good effort!&#8221; I bet it lifts his spirits when he hears it and he just wanted to share the same inspiration to his favorite athletes.</p>
<p>The story is touching and absolutely adorable. You have to admire this kid&#8217;s positivity and his good job and good effort in inspiring his team.</p>
<p>Postivity is so important. We can accomplish so much when we feel good and when we feel like we are doing well. To be sure, pain and suffering can be excellent sources of inspiration as well. Perhaps necessity and anguish are even more effective motivators. But for the majority of us whose lives are not overloaded with pain and suffering, positive reinforcement is a great motivator and a great way to keep us from falling into melancholy or apathy.</p>
<p>But the truth is that sometimes a good job or a good effort is simply not enough. It could be argued that the Heat did not do a good a job and did not give their best effort. But let&#8217;s grant them a good effort and a good job for a moment. They still lost the game! And the game matters. Their job was to win. Their job was to give effort and do a good job but more than that, their goal was to win.</p>
<p>In life, effort matters. But results matter more. Effort matters. But achieving your goals matters more.</p>
<p>I am not trying to be a Grinch. I have a point. I think that we all have passions and responsibilities in our lives. And sometimes we neglect them. But we pat ourselves on the back and say &#8220;Good job! Good Effort! and think that is enough. It&#8217;s a start. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>If we want to learn more Torah, give more charity, spend more time with our spouses and children, do more acts of lovingkindness, make a difference in our communities, we can&#8217;t be satisfied with good effort. We need to demand from ourselves action and results. We all want to do more than we are doing. We can each apply this to various areas of our lives.</p>
<p>Much of the talk on the Internet is effort and sometimes it&#8217;s a good job. But if we don&#8217;t actually accomplish anything, we are not maximizing our opportunities. So many great ideas and conversations happen on the blogs and Facebook and Twitter (notice I left out Google Plus&#8230;), we need to somehow channel all of that into actual change.</p>
<p>It can be done. It must be done. Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p>Your inspiration:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/014932_RTR2NDJN.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4356" title="Heat's James listens to a question during a news conference for the NBA Finals basketball series against the Mavericks in Dallas" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/014932_RTR2NDJN-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>A lot can be learned from one&#8217;s facial expressions. True empathy can be seen on one&#8217;s face. Pain, sadness, suffering, happiness, love and confidence are emotions that are worn on one&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it&#8217;s kind of a strange thing. Our emotions are in our brain. There are chemical reactions that determine the way our brains tell us we feel. Somehow those feelings translate into a universal language of facial expressions. Even if I cannot communicate via words with another, we can read each other&#8217;s facial expressions and at least have a general idea of how we are feeling.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful insight into this phenomena demonstrated by analyzing the hebrew word for face.<span id="more-4355"></span> The word used for face in the Torah is פנים (pronounced pah-neem). This word shares a root with the word בפנים (pronounced beef-neem). This word means &#8220;inside&#8221;. It is not a coincidence that these words share the same letters. The face gives clues as to what the person is feeling and thinking &#8220;inside&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is something that the video game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J5UQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217153&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B002I0J5UQ">L.A. Noire</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002I0J5UQ&amp;camp=217153&amp;creative=399349" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> tried to bring to its game. The game featured real facial expressions that reflect the thoughts and feelings of the actor. It was revolutionary and I might say, fairly succesful. The characters in the game seem more human and more emotive than any character in any other video game ever created. (See a demonstration here: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5802203/14-minutes-of-la-noires-unexpected-thrills" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>.)</p>
<p>The Atlantic has a fascinating slide show depicting LeBron James&#8217;s facial expressions during the NBA Finals. It is interesting because the criticism of LeBron&#8217;s performance in the Finals is about his heart, his determination, his confidence. These things can be measured on a person&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Have a look for yourself: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/06/nba-finals-recap-as-told-by-lebron-jamess-facial-expressions/240290/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scottie-pippen.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4287" title="scottie-pippen" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scottie-pippen-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="210" /></a>Last week the outrage over President Obama&#8217;s mideast speech was built around a partial quote of his words.</p>
<p>Critics quoted Obama&#8217;s statement that the future borders of Israel should be based on the 1967 borders. They neglected to quote the end of the statement which qualified that statement with the important caveat &#8220;with mutually agreed upon land swaps&#8221;. For some reason, the outrage that ensued only mentioned the 1967 borders. No one that was outraged included the context of the statement which made the 1967 borders statement much weaker.</p>
<p>(Now, even after Obama clarified his remarks some people were still outraged over other issues. I am not talking about those people.)</p>
<p>Today, one of the greatets NBA players of all time, Scottie Pippen, was asked about whether LeBron could be better than Michael Jordan, the greatest NBA player of all time. Pippen said, &#8220;&#8230;he may be&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is outrage. <span id="more-4286"></span>See Jordan is more than a bit of a deity in NBA circles. He is the best ever. And I don&#8217;t think anyone will ever be as dominant as Jordan was in his time. LeBron is great, but he is no Jordan. Not in numbers or in accomplishments and certainly not in dedication to winning. So if Pippen had said that LeBron was better than Jordan the outrage would be warranted.</p>
<p>But Pippen did not say that. His words are being taken out of context. He said, &#8220;he may be&#8221;, which means that one day, perhaps LeBron will surpass Jordan.</p>
<p>How can anyone outrage over that? Heck, any player MAY surpass Jordan.</p>
<p>But of course, when it comes to politics, sports [and religion], people are irrational. Irrationality causes people to miss context and explode before they can analyze the issues.</p>
<p>Last week it was Obama, this week it was Pippen. Who will be next week&#8217;s victim?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/r.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3640" title="r" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/r-300x212.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a>Last night, the Lakers pounded the Cleveland Cavaliers in historic fashion. The final score was 112-57. If the Lakers had one more basket they would have doubled up the Cavs. That&#8217;s just crazy.</p>
<p>One ex-Cavalier was enjoying the carnage. That would be one LeBron James. See, LeBron is supposedly very happy in his new Miami Heat jersey playing for a championship caliber team in South Beach. After all, it was his &#8220;decision&#8221; to go to Miami. But happy people don&#8217;t gratuitously &#8220;hate&#8221; on others.</p>
<p>Maybe LeBron isn&#8217;t so happy after all&#8230;</p>
<p>After the game, on his self titled, slightly narcissistic Twitter page called KingJames, LeBron tweeted this:<span id="more-3635"></span></p>
[blackbirdpie url="http://twitter.com/#!/KingJames/status/25061817583673344"]
<p>Now that&#8217;s a real mean spirited thing to say. Isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Happy people don&#8217;t usually speak that way. Role models certainly do not&#8230;</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not here to tell you LeBron is a bad role model. I am here to say that, to use a metaphor, LeBron has mixed his metaphors.</p>
<p>Karma is a concept found in Eastern Religions. Most versions of Karma, of which I am aware, subscribe a natural order to the world. When that order is disrupted there is an automatic reaction to that disruption. So, if A harms B, a disruption is formed. Then, A may end of being harmed, but it was his own fault because his harm was a result of the disruption he caused when he harmed B.</p>
<p>God plays no role in Karma. It is a natural reaction.</p>
<p>LeBron is confusing Karma with Divine Retribution. Oops!</p>
<p>Worse still is the hubris in the assumption that whatever happens to the Cavs is because of their fans&#8217; hatred of LeBron. They were scorned. Their hatred is not completely unwarranted. I am not sure why there would be any Divine Retribution for disliking LeBron.</p>
<p>One also has to wonder what LeBron thinks happened when his teams were summarliy eliminated from the playoffs the last few years. Was that Divine Retribution as well?</p>
<p>It seems to me that many athletes selectively blame and attribute God when it suits them. LeBron is thrilled that the Cavs lost last night so he thinks it was God. But when he loses I&#8217;m sure he doesn&#8217;t think that he lost due to some terrible things he did, of which there are plenty of documented episodes. It&#8217;s moronic to think that it is God deciding the games, but only when it suits you.</p>
<p>LeBron made three errors in that tweet. 1) It was nasty and mean spirited 2) He confused Karma and Divine Retribution and 3) He selectively attributed one event to Divine Retribution.</p>
<p>LeBron James: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/" target="_blank">Still not a role model</a>&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lebron_money.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2378" title="lebron_money" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lebron_money.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="239" /></a>The NBA Playoffs are here. That means 10 weeks of sporadic games until someone takes home the Larry O&#8217;Brien Trophy and gets to spritz champagne all over themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, the &lt;sarcasm&gt; Supreme King Master of the Basketball Universe, His Royal Heiness LeBron James is expected to win it all and take his team to the &#8220;Promised Land&#8221; and we will all fawn all over his super-human ability and charisma &lt;end sarcasm&gt;. That is until he reminds us that it is all about the money in the off-season, because LeBron is a free agent this summer.</p>
<p>I have had my criticisms of LeBron in the past. <span id="more-2377"></span>In <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/">Athletes as Role Models?</a> I reminded everyone that athletes are just athletes. They are not people worth looking up to. And in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/21/teamwork-important-in-sports-more-important-in-life/">Teamwork: Important in Sports, More Important in Life</a> I pointed out that for an athlete who is supposed to be such a team player, the video of LeBron with his teammates disappearing is a conflicting (and wrong) message.</p>
<p>The latest gripe I have with LeBron is even more serious. LeBron owns a marketing company call LRMR. In the NBA a marketing company is a conglomorate that tries to woo potential clients from the college ranks to sign with them to represent the athlete&#8217;s interest. The agency will market the player as a commodity to teams to negotiate salary as well to corporations to contract endorsement deals.</p>
<p>The business is shady enough as it is. College athletes are not allowed to accept payment or gifts. Marketing agencies will use 3rd parties to win over athletes in the hope that the 3rd party will control which agency the athlete chooses. Is it legal? probably. Nevertheless, it is definitiely shady. But when an athlete, especially an athlete with the influence of LeBron enters the fray, what was shady is now borderline unethical. If an athlete controls other athlete&#8217;s decisions by controlling their contract negotionations and endorsement deals, that is a level of control that is, in my view, wrong.</p>
<p>But maybe LeBron is such a sterling character that he would never dream of using his influence to contol athletes?</p>
<p>Sorry, but <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-lebronwall041310" target="_blank">according to this Yahoo News item</a>, LeBron is already working his magic on the most highyl touted NBA prospect since LeBron, John Wall.</p>
<p>Just another reason I don&#8217;t like LeBron&#8230;</p>
