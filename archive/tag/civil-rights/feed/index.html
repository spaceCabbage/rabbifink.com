				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that it is unconstitutional for a state to ban same sex marriage. The issue still divides America, though the latest Pew numbers say 54% of Americans are in favor of gay marriage and only 36% oppose.</p>
<p>In the Orthodox Jewish community, the matter is far less polarizing. I could not find any actual numbers, but I think most people are correct in assuming that the vast majority of Orthodox Jews oppose same sex marriage for themselves and for America. All the mainstream Orthodox Jewish umbrella organizations have issued statements over the past few years reiterating this opposition. Some Orthodox Jews are ambivalent on the issue, and a small minority are in favor of gay marriage.</p>
<p>I celebrate the Supreme Court decision.<span id="more-9339"></span></p>
<p>A lot of people are confused how an Orthodox rabbi who follows the Torah and its laws could celebrate the legalization of gay marriage.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/28/i-believe-in-torah-halacha-and-equality/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1-si/" rel="attachment wp-att-9340"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9340" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si_.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I have been mocked, berated, insulted, defrocked, and even ousted from Orthodoxy for supporting marriage equality. I’ve been asked, respectfully and less respectfully, how I reconcile my  belief in marriage equality and my religious beliefs. This is my official response.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a civil rights issue. Gay people exist. They are your neighbors and co-workers. They might be your friends and family as well. It’s hard to be gay in America. There’s trauma involved. Gay people fall in love. They want to live together as a married couple. They want to get married for the same reasons everyone else wants to get married. Restricting consenting adults from a loving, committed marriage is a form of discrimination. I believe that discrimination is wrong. I believe that citizens of free countries should not feel oppressed. I believe that more freedom for more people is a good thing for everyone, including Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>Of course, I am concerned about the implications of the ruling. I am concerned about clergy with religious objections to officiating a gay marriage, but those personal concerns cannot trump the more basic civil rights of others, especially people who typically suffer persecution and discrimination.</p>
<p>I am not concerned about slippery slopes or men marrying dogs and bikes and children. Marriage requires consent. Dogs, bikes, and children cannot consent.</p>
<p>I am not concerned that America is becoming a Godless state with no morals. If you want equal rights and protection under the law, everyone else must benefit, too. It is wrong to suggest that equality applies unevenly. Orwell said it best in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451526341/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0451526341&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=VHSNVVTJV2A2QCBZ">Animal Farm</a>, <em>&#8220;All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&#8221;</em> It is moral to be fair to others, even if those others are people who violate your religious beliefs. There are competing morals in this case, and America is choosing the more compassionate and the more just of the moral options.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a good thing. I celebrate marriage equality. I am also an Orthodox Jew and I would not perform a religious wedding ceremony that is not consistent with my understanding of Jewish law, including a gay marriage. Those two statements are not contradictory.</p>
<p>There is a long list of things that I think are very important to Orthodox Judaism. Banning gay marriage is near the bottom of the list. Kindness, compassion, and fairness are near the top of the list.</p>
<p>I understand that many Orthodox Jews have visceral fears about this gay marriage because of Jewish law. I hope we can get past those fears and move forward toward understanding and love.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gay-marriage-rights.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5686" title="gay-marriage-rights" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gay-marriage-rights-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The OU, RCA, and Agudath Israel of America have recently issued public statements expressing their dismay as the movement to grant same sex couples marriage rights gains momentum. Similarly, the OU and Agudath Israel of America issued a statement expressing their displeasure with the now famous contraceptive mandate in Obamacare.</p>
<p>While the two statements are similar, they are also very different. The Torah prohibits a specific kind of male on male lovemaking. The Torah does not recognize, or even provide a mechanism for two men or two women to wed in a religious ceremony. Legalizing same sex marriage is seen as an affront to these values. However, the Torah does not prohibit contraception. Yet, the orthodox Jewish organizations rallied together to support the Catholic Church which does prohibit contraceptive use for its membership.</p>
<p>The most reasonable explanation for these statements is that the orthodox Jewish organizations fear that if legislation is passed that is not consistent with the values of orthodox Judaism, those who practice orthodox Judaism could be subject to discrimination lawsuits. This explains their support of the Catholic Church in the battle over birth control. Although the issue does not affect orthodox Jews per se, it does have a collateral effect in that it could set dangerous precedent for governmental interference with religious practices and beliefs which could give rise to discrimination claims against orthodox Jews.</p>
<p><span id="more-5685"></span></p>
<p><em>(That is, I dismiss any and all arguments that these laws are actually a specific risk for orthodox Jews or the spiritual health of the nation.)</em></p>
<p>As farfetched as this may sound, the Court of Appeals in New Mexico just ruled on a case of similar concern. A gay couple called a photographer to do their wedding. They told the photog that the wedding was between two men. The photog responded that she doesn&#8217;t do &#8220;non-traditional weddings&#8221;. They meet a few times anyway. The couple didn&#8217;t use the photog, obviously. They sued the photog under a New Mexico statute that bans any &#8220;public accommodation&#8221; from discriminating based on race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.</p>
<p>The reasoning of the gay couple plaintiffs was that they were being discriminated against by a business operating in public and this violated the statute. The court ruled in their favor and the court of appeals affirmed the lower court&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>This sounds really, really scary for orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>Let me walk you off the ledge.</p>
<p>First of all, this is a very strange ruling. Using this interpretation of the statute, anything can be considered a public accommodation. Certainly City Hall is a public accommodation and in New Mexico, City Halls won&#8217;t give marriage licenses to gay couples! (Now City Hall is has immunity, but you get the idea &#8211; this is kind of a crazy ruling.) It is very likely that this ruling with reversed on appeal on this issue.</p>
<p>Second of all, it&#8217;s hard to see how this is true discrimination. There are plenty of photographers in New Mexico who would have loved to have the business. It&#8217;s not as if the couple had no options because of this photographer&#8217;s unwillingness to photograph a ceremony not recognized by their own state. Wouldn&#8217;t the gay couple want to reward and support photographers who endorse and approve their beliefs and choices?! Of course they would. So just hire one of those photogs. Problem avoided. If they can demonstrate that there is a conspiracy amongst photographers to withhold doing business with gay couples, it would be a much stronger case of discrimination.</p>
<p>Third of all, the photographer could have given a million different reasons for not taking the job. She could have said she is going on vacation or that she isn&#8217;t interested in working at that location or that she might not feel good that day or thats she has a funeral. Whatever. The point is that the only way a suit like this is possible, is in the precise situation at hand. That is, the defendant expressly says &#8220;I am not doing the job because you are gay&#8221;. It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to avoid this in the future. So even if the Court of Appeals ruling stands, it has limited utility.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the lesson? The lesson is that this anti-discrimintory statute in New Mexico is vague and broad and may cause unfair results. But more importantly, states are writing these statutes. Instead of making general statements of disapproval that sound awfully like we are trying to impose our religion&#8217;s morality on America, an idea many orthodox Jews find abhorrent, it would be wiser to try and influence or impact future legislation to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen in the future.</p>
<p>Gay marriage is already legal in New York and it will be legal everywhere eventually. Religious activists should engage in the legislative process to make sure that orthodox Jewish vendors and institutions are protected. Let&#8217;s spend our time and efforts on what will make the difference for our community. Let&#8217;s not waste time and energy fighting a losing battle. Same sex marriage is here to stay. There is no true sanctity of marriage in America. There might be sanctity of marriage within some religious groups, but that is not relevant to the issue at hand. Too many civil rights are attached to marriage to deny same sex couples those same opportunities without invoking religious beliefs. And as I am sure you know, one cannot use religious beliefs as the only basis for a law. So same sex marriage is going to happen everywhere. Let&#8217;s prepare ourselves for that reality by making certain that the statutes clearly allow for religious people to be able to choose with whom they do business so long as there are viable, vibrant options for the same sex couple.</p>
<p>But in the end, wouldn&#8217;t it be better if religious vendors were able to set aside their personal beliefs for the sake of civility and friendship? I mean, there is no prohibition that I am aware of in orthodox Judaism that would prevent a photographer from working a gay wedding. There is no problem for a tailor to hem a gown or cuff some pants for a gay wedding either. So I guess what I am saying is that while I respect religious beliefs very much, I don&#8217;t believe that one&#8217;s religious beliefs are sufficient cause to discriminate. To be clear, I am not talking about a member of the clergy performing a ceremony that does not even exist in his or her religion. I am referring to vendors who are uncomfortable working a gay ceremony. There is a difference. I don&#8217;t think anyone would expect a member of the clergy be required to perform a nonexistent ceremony. But there is no direct parallel to religious vendors.</p>
<p>It would make me much happier to see people find the good in others and respect their choices, than to use their beliefs as a tool for division. It would save a lot of time and grief as well.</p>
<p>So my suggestion to orthodox Jewish political activists is twofold. One, get involved in legislation to make sure our interests are protected and stop with the anti-gay platitudes. Two, encourage orthodox Jewish to consider setting aside their religious preferences for the sake of peace and maybe even kiddush Hashem (honestly, I am not sure about this one. But <em>eivah</em> certainly applies).</p>
<p>Hopefully, these ideas can bring us to a better future for all Americans. The religious, the gay, and the gay religious. All of us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WomensSiddur.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5033" title="WomensSiddur" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WomensSiddur.png?resize=236%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Rabbi Julie Schonfeld makes an outrageous claim and Ha&#8217;aretz runs with it.</p>
<p>The claim? A version of a siddur published in the 15th century contains the blessing <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em>. The blessing thanks God for making the one reciting the benediction a woman and not a man. Rabbi Schonfeld contends that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>&#8220;This Siddur </em><strong>proves</strong><em> that the degrading attitudes towards women, which we are seeing in certain extreme religious communities in Israel today, are a modern distortion of Judaism. Ironically, treatment of women in certain extreme sectors of the community is far more denigrating to women today than even the attitudes of the late Middle Ages.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>While I sympathize with Rabbi Schonfeld&#8217;s efforts in this regard, this siddur &#8220;proves&#8221; absolutely nothing of the sort. The siddur, which has been floating around the Internet for quite a few years now despite the attempt to portray this as an amazing new discovery, only proves that one woman had this siddur written on her behalf. It does not prove anything about the attitudes toward women in Medieval times.</p>
<p>Although, I would argue that the treatment of women in some Jewish communities in today&#8217;s day and age is not rooted in halacha as much as it is rooted in traditional, old-fashioned values that may or may not be compatible with halacha, Judaism or Torah. They are two separate things. But the siddur does not prove that. Nor does it prove that women were treated any better or worse in Medieval Europe.</p>
<p>The siddur, however <em>does </em>prove something very important in my eyes.<span id="more-5030"></span> It proves that the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> is not as nefarious as it seems. See, if a woman is willing to say <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em> she must not feel that it is a degrading blessing. It would be extremely hypocritical for an oppressed group to turn around and use the same degrading terminology against the group that is oppressing them. It would be like civil rights activists in 1965 organizing a bus with black people in the front and white people in the back. Reversing the roles in degrading situations is hardly a fair or open-minded approach to the problem.</p>
<p>It seems, that neither the one who makes the blessing <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em> nor the one who makes the blessing <em>shelo asani isha</em> is meant to be degrading. Rather, both are blessings expressing appreciation for one&#8217;s place in life. Both blessing are ways of practicing the concept of being happy with one&#8217;s lot. Just like one can be happy as a man and not a woman, one can be happy as a woman and not a man. Even if one has more commandments than the other.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this single instance of a woman having her own blessing validates the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em>. It shows that the true meaning of blessing is that one blesses whatever their situation happens to be. It is not an expression of superiority, nor is it an expression of oppression. It is just a blessing.</p>
<p>I understand that this will not change the perception of the public. I do believe that the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> appears offensive to outsiders (and even most to insiders who need to wrestle with apologetics to make it less offensive). I think the most effective way of preserving this ancient blessing is to understand what a blessing really is all about. Seeing a woman&#8217;s prayerbook with <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em> affirms to me that the blessing is not meant as a <em>tziduk ha&#8217;din</em> or an expression of having more mitzvos. Rather, it is an opportunity to thank God for one&#8217;s place in this world.</p>
<p>It is my hope that the public can accept that this blessing is not derogatory in intention or application. Rabbi Schonfeld&#8217;s new favorite siddur helps make that point.</p>

<p>Plessy v. Ferguson was the landmark Supreme Court case that held that racially segregated trains were constitutional so long as they were &#8220;separate but equal&#8221;.</p>
<p>Over half a century later &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; was shown to be a fallacy and inherently, separate was not equal.</p>
<p>Something that was drilled into me during my first year of law school, primarily by Professor Dan Schechter, was to put yourself in the the shoes of the people in the case. This is a useful tool because things can become so abstract in the law that we can forget that real humans are involved in the dispute and there are real human emotions often at play.</p>
<p>This idea is particularly poignant when discussing civil rights cases.<span id="more-4339"></span></p>
<p>Plessy was a real person. Ferguson was a real person. Their names are forever linked in the controversy surrounding their case. Plessy challenged the legality of separate train cars.Ferguson upheld their legality. What Plessy did took a lot of guts. What Ferguson did did not but would we have acted differently? Their choices made a real difference in real lives. Plessy inspired a civil rights movement and Ferguson forced that movement to bide its time. Real people. Real consequences. Real history.</p>
<p>Recently, their grandchildren started a civil rights foundation. Together. They are rewriting their history from Plessy vs. Ferguson to Plessy <em>and</em> Ferguson.</p>
<p>Just beautiful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Supreme-Court1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2269" title="Supreme-Court" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Supreme-Court.jpg?resize=270%2C203" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A few weeks ago my brother-in-law asked me which branch of government I thought was the most powerful. I immediately answered, &#8220;Legislative&#8221;. He was surprised. As a fellow law student we read case after case where the Supreme Court overturned laws that it felt were unconstitutional. While that is true, it requires Herculean effort for the Supreme Court to overturn a law. The legislature can just write a new law whenever they want. That gives them almost all the power.</p>
<p>It has long been my feeling that legislatures are the best place to effect change in laws. Citizens can petition their law makers to make laws that they want and of they don&#8217;t make law that their constituents like, they can vote someone who will into office. Is this a slow process? Sure. But the Supreme Court process is even slower and the chance that your case will be heard is slim.</p>
<p>There is a second issue when the Judicial Branch speaks from &#8220;on-high&#8221; and mandates a change in law.<span id="more-2267"></span> This was illustrated to me by my supervising research attorney at the California Court of Appeals. He agreed with me that the Legislative Branch is most powerful. He added that sometimes a Supreme Court opinion can have the reverse effect that it intends. For example, in Roe v. Wade, the court held that laws banning / highly regulating abortion in the first trimester were unconstitutional. The reaction from the strident voice of opposition was not the acquiesce and lay low. In fact, it had the opposite affect. Millions and millions of dollars were poured into &#8220;overturning Roe&#8221;. This went on for decades. Interest groups spent all their energy trying to get Roe reversed. But if Roe had not sued in the Supreme Court or if the Supreme Court had denied to see hear Roe, it is very likely that the legislatures would have come around to see the law the way the Supreme Court saw it. In other words, if all the money and time and energy of the Supreme Court case had been spent on activism and PR in favor of looser abortion restrictions, it would have happened organically. And the reaction would not have been so severe.</p>
<p>Sometimes the people are not ready for the ruling of the Supreme Court. Sometime they need time to adjust their old views and in time, they will get it right. This is one of the main reasons there has been weak attempts to take the issue of same sex marriage to the Supreme Court. Even if the Supreme Court rules in their favor, a huge backlash is predicted. This would wind up having the opposite of the intended effect. Time, energy and money would be spent on &#8220;overturning&#8221; the decision. It is wiser to just wait until the people are willing to give them the rights they desire. (Of course this assumes this is bound to happen. As I wrote a while back in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/03/human-beings-are-social-beings/">Human Beings Are Social Beings</a>, more and more people know gay individuals and couples, it is going to be harder and harder to look them in the eye and say &#8220;no rights for you&#8221;. So I am pretty sure it will probably happen eventually.)</p>
<p>Another perfect example of change having the opposite of its desired effect is in the area of Health Care Reform. President Obama and almost all the Democrats want to regulate Health Care. They promise that rates will drop, insurance companies will be forced to be fairer and less discriminatory and everything will be wonderful. As I am self-insured, the new laws may actually help me, but probably not before I get a job with medical benefits.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the proposed bill is having the OPPOSITE effect. My health care premiums went up by 30% a couple months ago. My coverage is the same. My plan is the same. I just pay way more. The NY Times even had a write-up on MY insurance company. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/opinion/19fri1.html?scp=1&amp;sq=anthem%20blue%20cross&amp;st=cse">Editorial &#8211; The Lesson of California&#8217;s Anthem Blue Cross on Health &#8230;</a>) Sometimes, when change is forced down people&#8217;s throats, the effect is the opposite of what is intended. HCR may be wonderful, but in the meantime, it is squeezing millions of self-insured folks as they wait&#8230;</p>
<p>So how does change happen? It is best for it to happen organically. It is best for things to evolve, change slowly without huge monumental changes from &#8220;on-high&#8221;.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a story I read once:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The sun and the wind were having a contest to see you could get the man to remove his coat. The wind blew hard and the man clutched his coat tighter. The wind blew even harder and the man redoubled his efforts to hold his coat. The sun shone bright and the man got warm and took his coat off on his own.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>(Where are we going with this? You&#8217;ll see soon.)</p>
