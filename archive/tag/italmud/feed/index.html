				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fshas.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5217" title="fshas" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fshas-300x176.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="176" /></a>In case you have not heard, Artscroll is joining the digital revolution. Perhaps Artscroll&#8217;s greatest contribution to date is the Schottenstein Talmud. Their version of the Talmud is comprehensive and useful for beginners and scholars alike. It has likely opened the doors of Talmud study to more people than any other edition of the Talmud in the history of the Talmud.</p>
<p>Now Artscroll is taking the Talmud to the next level. As mentioned previously, the iPad is a magical Torah study device. It lends itself to Torah study more than any other piece of technology. You can hold it in your hand, you navigate with your fingers, pop-ups are the perfect method for providing additional information beyond the text that is so key to Talmud study. Artscroll is bringing the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud to the iPad.</p>
<p>The features are extensive and the video below outlines many of the key features. It&#8217;s a really impressive feature set.<span id="more-5216"></span></p>
<p>iTalmud did a wonderful job with their limited resources. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/14/italmud-ipad-edition-app-review/" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a>. They did not have access to the copyrighted material and research that went into the Schottenstein edition. But iTalmud pales in comparison to what Artscroll can offer. Of course I expect this to be reflected in the price, iTalmud is $40. Each volume of the printed Shottenstein Talmud is $40 and some tractates are several volumes long. If ebook prices are any indication, the Artscroll digital edition will be priced similarly to the printed edition. That is a lot of money.</p>
<p>A source tells me that there will be various options to gain access to the app. You can buy a daf, a tractate or the entire Shas. There will also be a rental model that will allow users to follow along with the Daf Yomi giving access to each particular daf for a limited time. I think the price will be one of the more interesting story lines as the app moves from development to the marketplace.</p>
<p>The iPad will be the first digital edition of the Shottenstein but my source also tells me that Android and desktop version will eventually follow.</p>
<p>Artscroll has hired the best Jewish app developer out there in <a href="http://www.rustybrick.com/" target="_blank">RustyBrick</a> to write the software and you can be confident that the final product will be elegant, simple to use and very powerful. RustyBrick also works hard to constantly update their apps to bring more features to the end users. I am happy for my friends at RustyBrick.</p>
<p>Artscroll is doing this because they think it will be a good business decision. I am happy that they are ready to embrace the digital era. Now we just need to get our yeshivos and rabbinic leaders to follow the lead of the community.</p>
<p>Here is a severely overdramatic video about the upcoming app. Whatever happened to understated, humble marketing? Yeesh. This thing is way out of control. (I also don&#8217;t love using copyrighted music for a product that so covets its own copyrights.) But shout out to my friend <a href="http://baltimorejewishlife.com" target="_blank">Jeff Cohn</a> who makes a cameo at 3:00!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><em><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4938" title="italmud-ipad-edition-screenshot-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/italmud-ipad-edition-screenshot-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></em><em>Way back in 2009, I did a review of iTalmud English for the iPhone. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/10/22/italmud-english-edition-review/">iTalmud English Edition: Review</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A few months ago we got an iPad and I could not wait to try <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a>. Torah learning is much easier on a bigger screen and the navigation through an iPad app is less crowded than on an iPhone. I&#8217;ve been testing the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a> and it with recent updates and the bigger screen the iPad app is one of the best apps I have used on the iPad. Period.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I figured to give you all a real taste of what using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a> is like I would give you a walkthrough with photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before we begin, I will just say that if you have an iPad and have any interest in studying Talmud, this is the absolutely best way to do it. The Torah is timeless and when technology can be leveraged to make the experience more accessible, exciting and convenient, it speaks to the eternal nature of the Torah and its people. When you think about it, it can be quite inspiring.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here we go:<span id="more-4914"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I always begin studying a page of the Talmud with the traditional page view.  iTalmud provides clear PDFs of every folio of the Talmud. It is a straight PDF with no iOS magic. Functional and perhaps enough to justify spending $40. Imagine having the entire Talmud accessible on an iPad!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0036.png"><img class="wp-image-4916 aligncenter" title="IMG_0036" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0036.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>To change pages, one taps the book icon on the top of the page and using the iOS selection wheel can turn to any Tractate and any page in that Tractate in an instant. It takes about 2 seconds to download each PDF over wifi. It does not feel like you are &#8220;waiting&#8221; when you switch pages. Here I have switched from Shabbos to Brachos in an instant. In real life that would mean going to a bookshelf and replacing one overly large tome with another. Amazing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0035.png"><img class="wp-image-4915 aligncenter" title="IMG_0035" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0035.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to be able to read folio pages when offline you can download PDFs of every Daf View page and save them for later in the Download Manager. There is no charge to keep these on your iPad. Additionally, the app provides excellent audio classes for each page. These can also be downloaded and saved for later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0037.png"><img class="wp-image-4917 aligncenter" title="IMG_0037" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0037.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s move on. Daf View is nice, but the other stuff is where we experience the real magic of iTalmud. I use landscape view for viewing the PDFs. It just seems more natural. But for the other modes I mostly use portrait view. (We will stick with landscape for now.) Switching modes is simple. Just tap the page icon on he bottom left. A menu pops up and you can select how you would like iTalmud to display text. Until now we have been using Daf View.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0039.png"><img class=" wp-image-4919 aligncenter" title="IMG_0039" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0039.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now I&#8217;ve selected &#8220;Hebrew Text&#8221; and &#8220;Rashi&#8221;. As you can see, this view is just text without the traditional Daf format. But I have also selected Rashi and the commentary is displayed split-screen style on the left. The two columns are independent and can be scrolled on their own. So if Rashi is lower down on the page you can scroll the left side down but leave the right side where it is. This is great.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0040.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4920" title="IMG_0040" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0040.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also can select Tosfos and Tosfos will be displayed instead of Rashi. Everything else remains the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0041.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4921" title="IMG_0041" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0041.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another option is to have the English translation displayed. This translation is the Soncino translation with the Footnotes. If you tap a footnote and popup displays the text of the footnote.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0042.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4922" title="IMG_0042" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0042.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve switched the view to portrait. In this view, the secondary text, in this case Rashi, gets moved to the bottom of the screen. I have also tapped on the Daf Yomi shiurim menu. Here, we can see a list of local Daf Yomi classes and their locations. Languages are included so that you can find the class that best meets your needs. You can also enter an address and find  class near that address. Unfortunately, this feature did not work for me. The keyboard kept disappearing. I hope this is fixed in a future update.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0043.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4923" title="IMG_0043" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0043.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes you want to go directly to a specific page. You can easily navigate to any page using the browse and search menu. The English Keyword search is also great. As I have beards on my mind (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/13/the-shave-heard-round-the-world/">The Shave Heard &#8216;Round the World</a>) I typed &#8220;beard&#8221; into the search and the results displayed everywhere the word beard occurs in the Talmud. This is a really super tool. Tapping a result sends you to that page. This is great, but could be better. The place on the page that the word occurs is not highlighted anywhere. This would not be so bad if there were a &#8220;search this page&#8221; option but iTalmud does not have that feature yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0044.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4924" title="IMG_0044" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0044.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the coolest things in the iTalmud app is a $5 add-on. I bought it because it was useful to me and I think it is a great feature. To bring up the extras pop-up just tap on the Extras menu icon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0045.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4925" title="IMG_0045" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0045.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With Biblical References&#8221; add-on you can tap any verse from Scripture that is quoted in the Talmud and explore that verse. So just click buy and then it is automatically built into the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0047.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4927" title="IMG_0047" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0047.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, I tapped a verse on Brachos 2a. Tapping the verse brings up a menu where you can choose which commentary should be displayed with the text of the verse from the Torah. I chose English. The verse is automatically highlighted and the commentary is inline.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0049.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4929" title="IMG_0049" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0049.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I tried to select Rashi, but it was not working. That&#8217;s another kink that needs to be worked out. But the others work. Here is the Ramban on that verse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0050.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4930" title="IMG_0050" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0050.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here is Ibn Ezra. It could not be simpler.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0051.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4931" title="IMG_0051" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0051.png" alt="" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also want to show you a full-screen view that removes the menus and just shows the text on the screen. This is the ideal method for studying. No distractions and it uses the maximum of the real estate. It would even better if iTalmud could do Airplay and be displayed on an external display. Maybe next version&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0052.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4932" title="IMG_0052" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0052.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So there you have it. That&#8217;s how I use iTalmud English for iPad. I am sure many of you would use it differently. That&#8217;s part of the beauty of the app. It can be used your way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have one more suggestion for a future release (my father actually suggested it to me). It would be great if illustrations and models could be provided as well. The Talmud can be so well illuminated by diagrams and graphics. Some sections require illustrations. I hope a future release could provide pop-up graphics for these sections of the Talmud.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other than that, search on the page and a couple of bugs iTalmud is one of the most complete iPad apps I have had the pleasure of using. I highly recommend the app and even more than the app, I recommend studying Talmud.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Purchase the app here: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a>. Check out <a href="http://www.crowdedroad.com/" target="_blank">Crowded Road’s other apps and services on their website</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>Promotional consideration was provided by Crowded Road for the review of their iTalmud English for iPad app. I was given the app free of charge.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1597" title="iTalmud" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/iTalmud.jpg" alt="iTalmud" width="100" height="101" />I love technology and I love Talmud. So imagine how excited I was when I found out that I could learn Talmud on my iPhone!</p>
<p>For the last few weeks I have been testing an incredible iPhone app. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=326474560&amp;mt=8">iTalmud English Edition</a> (warning: link will open iTunes) is one the best apps I have ever used on the iPhone.</p>
<p>iTalmud English Edition is a very powerful tool that anyone that wishes to study or research anything in the Talmud must have.<span id="more-1596"></span></p>
<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>
<p>All good iPhone apps maintain the beauty and simplicity of the iPhone in their user experience. iTalmud English Edition is all those and much more. It is so easy to use and so elegantly presented that it almost feels like an iPhone app developed by Apple! When you start the app you get a simple menu with the basic functions of iTalmud English Edition.</p>
<p><strong>What Does iTalmud English Edition Do?</strong></p>
<p>The app brings the entire Talmud to your fingertips. You can browse the entire Talmud by page or search the entire Talmud by term. The app includes an English translation of the Talmud that is easily accessed as well.  In addition, audio classes of every single page are available via the menu. You can find any Daf Yomi class in the world from the menu as well.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Talmud</strong></p>
<p>There are 3 ways to read Talmud in iTalmud English Edition. The default view is a modern Hebew font text view. The text size is large enough to read and wherever Rashi has a commentary the words are hyperlinked so that clicking the text will bring up the Rashi. Very intuitive and perhaps the way Rashi intended us using his commentary &#8211; through hyperlinks! iTalmud English Edition also gives you the standard Talmud page view. When invoked, the app downloads a pdf of the folio with the tzuras hadaf preserved. Using multitouch gestures like pinching to zoom and flicking to scroll you can navigate the page pretty easily. The 3rd way to read Talmud with iTalmud English Edition is to read in English. The user just needs to tap the English button on the menu bar and the full English text of the page is displayed. It&#8217;s really easy to use. Also, a bookmark can be placed at any time so that you can return to that spot later by tapping bookmarks in the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to Talmud</strong></p>
<p>Many people prefer to have a teacher guide them through the Talmud. iTalmud English Edition has a full library of audio lectures on every page of the Talmud. The classes are taught by <a href="http://www.dafyomi.org/aboutrg.php" target="_blank">Rav Dovid Grossman</a>, an accomplished Rebbe in Yeshiva Gedola of Los Angeles. His explanations are clear and concise and make learning Talmud easier and interesting. The classes are downloaded to your iPhone but stay within the app so you can listen while you read along on using any of the three ways to read Talmud.</p>
<p><strong>Search</strong></p>
<p>Type any Hebrew or Aramaic word into the search box and you will get a comprehensive list of where that word is found in the Talmud. Tap on any of the pages listed and it will take you to that page and the word your searched will be highlighted. This is really a great tool if you are preparing a dvar Torah or just can&#8217;t recall the exact page of a Talmudic passage you remember. One limitation of the search is that the results are limited. So when I searched for a fairly common term, the results ended after 3 tractates. Hopefully, this is something that can be addressed in a later version.</p>
<p><strong>Daf Yomi</strong></p>
<p>All around the world, people study Talmud. There is a universal folio a day cycle called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi" target="_blank">Daf Yomi</a>. In almost any city with Jewish people studying Talmud one can find lectures on that day&#8217;s stduy. With iTalmud English Edition the location of those lectures is easy to find. iTalmud English Edition will give you as much information as possible. Details include time, location, phone number, teacher and language. A vital tool to folio a day students around the world, iTalmud English Edition, will help you find a lecture near you.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I give iTalmud English Edition 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, a gold medal, whatever. It is a really impressive iPhone app. The price is right too. At $25 you can have the entire Talmud in your pocket &#8211; 4 ways! Compare that with a print Talmud which will run anywhere from $150 to $1500. The app gives you everything you need to study Talmud at home or on the road.
