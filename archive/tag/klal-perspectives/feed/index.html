				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t write about practical politics on my Haaretz blog or this blog very often. My preferences and ideas about political issues certainly seep into the content, but the purpose of my writing is not to score political points or convert people to a particular political position.</p>
<p>Last week, I objected to the reckless accusation that President Obama is “<em>anti-Israel and borderline anti-Jewish</em>” and argued that <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/07/13/thank-you-president-obama/" target="_blank">Jewish people should have gratitude for the President’s generosity and support for Israel</a>. The fact that critics may think he is a terrible president or a failure in every possible way, should not change obviate critics from expressing appreciation.</p>
<p>While saying thank you is important to me, and I believe gratitude it is a valuable lesson on its own, that was not the real purpose of the article. To me, it was part of a much broader, and much more important issue.<span id="more-8619"></span></p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism, in a reflection of the rest of our society, has an increasingly difficult time dealing with non-absolutes. We want our heroes to be perfect and our villains to be perfectly evil. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a coincidence that our clothing is increasingly black and white and I think it’s having an effect on our thinking.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/07/14/time-end-black-white-thinking/5672370492_c50619e00c_b/" rel="attachment wp-att-8621"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8621" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/5672370492_c50619e00c_b-e1405368551190-600x360.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="5672370492_c50619e00c_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Our rabbis and generational leaders have been transformed from human beings with flaws, foibles, and personalities, into angelic beings who have always been perfect. Mere mention of struggles, or acting “normal,” is scrubbed from biographical sketches and we are expected to believe that our great sages were always great. Similarly, even the implication that a great sage erred is sacrilegious. We are unwilling to acknowledge that great people can make mistakes, incredibly this even applies in areas that are unabashedly not their expertise. I can’t help but think that this is part of a subconscious effort to make things simpler for ourselves. The good are perfect. I don’t need to think anymore.</p>
<p>We place our institutions on the same pedestal. If an organization or educational program is good, then it becomes above reproach. Criticism can be dismissed out of hand because the good is perfect. If a yeshiva is protecting a predator, we can’t do anything about it because the institution is unimpeachable.</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum we consistently predetermine the value or status of people and groups who are considered bad or unacceptable. Once they are deemed bad, we don’t have to consider anything that they say or do. When someone leaves the community, their ideas and opinions magically become meaningless. If a group engages in behavior we find objectionable, we are to have no association with them under any circumstances. We regularly reject ideas out of hand simply because of their place of origin.</p>
<p>Life is simple in this kind of world. You’re either my ally or my foe. If you’re my ally, I will never say anything negative about you. If you are my foe, I will never say anything positive about you. Arbitrary characteristics and behavior become the touch points for this determination and suddenly nothing else matters.</p>
<p>I find this binary mode of thinking extremely harmful and dangerous. No one is perfect and no one is perfectly evil. Good people make mistakes and bad people do good things too. People I agree with about some things can do things that I find objectionable and people I generally find objectionable, often do things I find extremely valuable.</p>
<p>There is wisdom everywhere. There is goodness everywhere. There is so much to learn from everyone.</p>
<p>Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone can do better. Everyone can learn more.</p>
<p>President Obama may be the worst president in the history of the United States. He may have done terrible things and made tons of mistakes. You may dislike as a person and politician. None of that would preclude us from saying thank you. We need to practice seeing the world and its people in more complex terms. We all think that we are complicated and multifaceted. Everyone else is too.</p>
<p>This was a big part of why I chose to write that we should say thank you to President Obama. We need to learn how to see people and groups and ideas without predetermining the value of their contributions to society. Instead, we should be deciding where we disagree or which specific things meet our disapproval. Meanwhile, on everything else we can agree and approve.</p>
<p>It’s so much more powerful to be open to the possibility that there is value in everyone and everything. We given ourselves, our leaders, and our intellectual opponents greater opportunity to grow, change, evolve, and most of all, improve.</p>
<p>Although such thinking is rare, there are many exceptions. One exception is the great <a href="http://klalperspectives.org" target="_blank">Klal Perspectives</a> online journal. This publication begins with the premise that we have issues that need to be addressed. The writers and firmly in the camp of the establishment, but are comfortable enough to accept the premise that we can do better. Inevitably this means there will be, at the very least, muted criticism of (small O) orthodox ideas. Suggestions for change and improvement are offered in nearly every article.</p>
<p>Klal Perspectives recently published a new issue about education for teenage boys in the yeshiva system. I’ve read some of the articles and will probably write something about the questions presented by Klal Perspectives. But I think it’s important to acknowledge the greatness of seeing problems as complex and intricate instead of choosing sides in advance and turning off one’s brain.</p>
<p>We need more of this kind of thinking. Thanking the president is one example. Klal Perspectives is another. Let’s work towards making this the standard mode of thinking. Let’s choose fewer sides and choose to see more sides to every issue. If we are successful, I have a feeling we will start seeing more solutions to our problems.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6714" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image_preview.jpeg?resize=300%2C261" alt="image_preview" data-recalc-dims="1" />Last week, the Fall 2012 issue of Klal Perspectives was released. I noted the excellent article written by Rabbi Ilan Feldman and recommended that everyone read it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/20/one-excellent-article-from-the-new-klal-perspectives-kiruv-issue/">One Excellent Article From Klal Perspectives Fall 2012 on Kiruv</a>)</p>
<p>I mentioned at the time that I would attempt to address the issues raised in the journal.</p>
<p>Klal Perspective writers were asked to address three general questions. Some additional background is provided on the Klal Perspectives site. See here: <a href="http://klalperspectives.org/fall-2012/fall-2012-questions/">Klal Perspectives</a>. These are the three questions:</p>
<p>1. What are the most significant dimensions of current outreach efforts, and how effective are they?</p>
<p>2. In light of the various alternative objectives that may be pursued in conducting outreach, by what criteria is success measured? Are the prevailing measurements of success the appropriate measurements? Can results be reliably calculated? And how is the donor or volunteer able to ascertain which target demographic and which approach to kiruv enjoys the greatest realization and success?</p>
<p>3. Has kiruv in America runs its course due to the combination of (a) decades of assimilation that has diminished the number of accessible, non-observant Jews who are halachically Jewish, and (b) the rapidly diminishing sense of Jewish identity among younger, secular Jews? Or, do these factors mitigate in favor a more powerful outreach push, since in a decade or two it may be too late? And finally, what are the new frontiers in outreach that may yet be explored?</p>
<p>My response:<span id="more-6669"></span></p>
<p>Klal Perspectives did not define their terms when they asked for responses to their three questions. The questions are also very vague. As a result it is not easy to simply answer the three questions without making several assumptions. This article will not make any assumptions about definitions nor will it fill in the gaps of the vague questions.</p>
<p><b>I. Dimensions of Successful Kiruv</b></p>
<p>I don’t know what “the most significant dimensions of current outreach efforts” means so I can’t really answer that part of the question. I can’t answer how effective they are because I don’t know what is being discussed. I think the question might be asking in a roundabout way, what kind of kiruv is most effective. If that is what is being asked, the question is backwards.</p>
<p>In my experience, I have seen that kiruv is not a success or a failure depending on the group or sub-group that a particular kiruv professional is working with. Success is almost always dependent on the individual kiruv professional’s drive, talent, and commitment. In other words, focusing on the demographic is a huge error. A great kiruv professional will have success no matter the age, no matter the ethnicity, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p>This is because kiruv is not about systems, or programs, or even content. Kiruv is about relationships and good sales.</p>
<p>The successful kiruv professional is an outstanding salesperson. An outstanding salesperson can sell to anyone. Put an excellent kiruv professional in any setting and the kiruv professional will be very successful. Therefore, trying to figure out which of our current kiruv efforts is most effective looks at the wrong side of the equation. It’s less about the pool of prospective kiruv candidates and much more about the person doing the kiruv.</p>
<p>It’s also about the product being sold. Some kiruv professionals sell the version of orthodox Judaism that is the simplest sell. It is often riddled with half-truths and late night television informercial promises. This might work for a short time, or even a long time, but ultimately it is a dangerous game. We don’t want to ensnare people into orthodox Judaism, we want people to be attracted to orthodox Judaism. The good salesperson with the hard sell might be very successful on the surface, but that kind of kiruv is just creating problems that will manifest later on. The best salesperson is honest, straightforward, and passionate. We have a great product. There is no need to puff it up like a used car salesperson. Again, success is less about the group being targeting and more about the sale.</p>
<p>Successful, long term kiruv requires relationships and a good, honest sell.</p>
<p><b>II. Measuring Success</b></p>
<p>This is the area of kiruv where I think I am the furthest from the mainstream. Millions of dollars are being poured into kiruv and there is an expectation of quantifiable results and success. This is generally measured as facilitating a move from non-<i>shmiras mitzvos</i> to <i>shmiras mitzvos</i>. At the very least it has been defined as “preventing an intermarriage.”</p>
<p>Most people who become <i>shomer mitzvos </i>do so as a result of many influences in their lives. The initial kiruv professional who introduced them to a nice frum family, the frum family that introduced them to the charismatic pulpit rabbi, the pulpit rabbi who sent them off the <i>yeshiva, </i>the rebbeim at the yeshiva who worked with them as beginners, the teachers of the more advanced tracks in the <i>yeshiva, </i>the family in <i>Eretz Yisrael </i>who took them into their home, the rabbi who counseled them after they started <i>shmiras mitzvos, </i>and the anonymous person who made a kiddush Hashem through their excellent character and was merely observed, are all people who can take “credit” for helping this person. Donors are likely seeing several parties “claim” each kiruv success story which makes definitive numbers even more elusive.</p>
<p>Further complicating matters, many organizations and communities have segmented their kiruv efforts as a result of applying business principles to kiruv. One group makes initial contact and inspires the potential kiruv candidate. Another group handles the potential kiruv candidate through the first stages of real kiruv. The next group pushes the potential kiruv candidate to study in yeshiva.</p>
<p>The problem is that when one is pushed through a system no one person in that system feels solely responsible for that person. Initially, this is not an issue as the system takes care of its people. But when the kiruv is done and the person returns from yeshiva, the people who placed the person along this exciting path of discovery and change are working on their next potential kiruv candidates. Compounding matters, the group that attracts new people to orthodox Judaism, and the group that cultivates that interest, and the group who push the potential kiruv candidate to yeshiva may be very, very good at what they do, but they may have no idea how to counsel and guide a baal teshuva. Too often, those who have become frum get terrible advice from the people who helped them find their Judaism in the first place. Then it is the community rabbis and others who are left to pick up the pieces. Sometimes the pieces can’t be put back together and we are left with a broken home, confused children, and resentment toward orthodox Judaism. Helping baalei teshuva is not necessarily the forte of kiruv workers, and even if it were something they could do, or wanted to do, they are busy finding the next group of potential kiruv candidates. Helping people who are already frum does not help their numbers anymore. The sale has been made. It’s time to move on.</p>
<p>It’s wrong to think that once someone is frum they won’t need a lot of guidance. Everything is new to them. What is second nature to those who are frum from birth has to be learned by those who are not. Family relationships must be managed and complicated questions of loyalty are often raised. Helping people who are already frum does not have the glamour of kiruv, but it is vital to the success of our kiruv efforts.</p>
<p>Using metrics to measure success and as a basis for funding has many advantages. It incentivizes efficiency, it gives kiruv professionals real goals, and it gives the donors reason to believe that their monies are being used wisely. There is a darker side to the metrics as well. Kiruv professionals run the risk of viewing kiruv candidates as numbers instead of looking at them as human beings. It also can harm efforts to help baalei teshuva once they return from yeshiva. But most importantly I think it has established a standard in kiruv that is simply wrong.</p>
<p>I disagree with the popular definition of kiruv. I don’t think that the goal of kiruv to facilitate one’s movement from non-<i>shmiras mitzvos</i> to <i>shmiras mitzvos</i>. I think that in order to foster a real relationship with another person, the foundation of the relationship must be truth. When I worked as a kiruv professional on college campuses students were often suspicious that the only reason I was being nice to them was because I wanted something from them. They reasoned to themselves that I was friendly because I hoped they would adopt my lifestyle. They assumed that the free things I was throwing at them had ulterior motives. Perhaps they thought I received a cash bonus for every Shabbos they kept. My employers, or maybe it was just their donors, wanted people to become frum and that’s why I was talking to them. They might have been right. But I did not want them to be right. So I worked very hard to make sure that I was genuinely concerned with their wellbeing. My exclusive interest and explicitly stated goal was to foster friendships. I was not selling anything. I was just making friends. I wanted these friends to become part of my life, my family, my community, and come to Israel with me when I took my college student friends on a trip to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>It was very important to me that I be able to look every single student in the eye and say “I just want to provide you with an opportunity for a relationship with an orthodox rabbi.” That’s all. That was my goal. It had to be my goal if I was going to be honest with everyone that I met. And I really wanted to be completely honest.</p>
<p>My employers and supporters wanted to see students becoming <i>shomrei Torah u’mitzvos </i>and so did I, most of the time. But that was not my goal. It was one of many possible outcomes that would result from a relationship. The relationship was my goal.</p>
<p>That experience has profoundly impacted the way I view kiruv. I think that the stated goal of kiruv should not be <i>shmiras mitzvos. </i>In my mind, the goal of kiruv is to “<b>provide positive Jewish experiences to the maximum number of people possible.</b>” This way I can be honest. This way I can be proud of providing those experiences. This way I can make my goals based on what I am doing and not the choices of others. I can provide the experience, I can make the experience positive. I cannot control what others will do as a result of those experiences. If one is inspired by the experience and wants to learn more, I am willing, ready, and able to help them along that path.</p>
<p>In my shul, we try to create positive Jewish experiences for the maximum number of people possible. This is our goal. I can say with certainty that we are very successful at achieving this goal. Every year, hundreds of people have positive Jewish experiences in my shul. Some of them are frum people, some of them are not yet frum, some of them will never be frum, but they all have positive Jewish experiences. (Parenthetically, I think this should be the goal of orthodox Jewish education for our own children and communities). Accomplishing this goal requires a community of people who are committed to this goal and an environment that accepts everyone without judgment. We do not allow non-orthodox Jews to step into a shul and feel like fresh kiruv candidate meat. They are not. We make sure that whoever steps into our shul feels the brotherhood of Judaism and that they too can find something special in their Judaism through our shul.</p>
<p>If the positive Jewish experience inspires someone to be a better person, albeit not a frum Jew, that is also a good thing. If the positive Jewish experience challenges a non-affiliated Jew to go to a Reform Temple or a Conservative Synagogue more often, that is also a success. If we make a kiddush Hashem because more people have favorable things to say about frum Jews and commitment to Torah, that is also a success.</p>
<p>We can’t tell potential kiruv candidates that they are only a “real” baal teshuva if they go to a certain type of yeshiva and end up wearing a black hat on Shabbos. I have heard too many examples of people involved with kiruv organizations hearing from their kiruv rabbis that modern orthodoxy is not an option. They hear that modern orthodoxy is just as bad, or as pointless as being Conservative or Reform. This is wrong on several levels. Modern orthodoxy need not be viewed as a compromise or lesser form of orthodox Judaism. It is not. Further, we can’t allow ourselves to perpetuate the myth that non-orthodox Jews are devoid of spirituality and commitment. This is simply untrue. There are orthodox Jews who are devoid of spirituality and commitment and there are non-orthodox Jews who are spiritually fulfilled and very committed to their brand of Judaism. Kiruv cannot be an all or nothing proposition. Kiruv is about creating relationships with people and it is about giving people positive Jewish experiences. Right wing orthodox Judaism is not for everyone and we must provide opportunities for people to grow Jewishly in many ways, not only by blossoming into one specific type of orthodox Jew.</p>
<p>Using a very narrow definition of kiruv and focusing on the numbers to determine success can potentially undermine these efforts. Most importantly, by changing our focus to a more holistic approach to kiruv, as a community we will be more conscious of the needs of those who are moving through the kiruv system as kiruv professionals will not be bogged down by pursuing numbers and kiruv won’t end after the sale has been made.</p>
<p><b>III. The Future</b></p>
<p>Kiruv has not run its course. It is just as important today as it was yesterday. It helps the frum community hone its message, but more importantly, it allows frum Jews and not frum Jews to interact. Interdenominational interaction is still taboo in the frum community. One of the few trapdoors we have into that world is our kiruv efforts. We need more of that, not less. Non-orthodox Jews are our family. There has been too much separation between us. We can no longer afford to cut off our nose to spite our face. Hopefully that will change for the better soon. But if the only way to maintain dialogue with our non-orthodox brothers and sisters is via kiruv, <i>dayenu</i>.</p>
<p>I think the future of kiruv is along the lines of the model I have suggested here. The future is providing orthodox Jewish experiences for the masses. These experiences will be without pretense and with no expectation of commitment. But the more people who are exposed to orthodox Judaism, the greater number of people who will find it attractive. There will always be people who want to live the beautiful life of committed, passionate orthodox Judaism. We want those who might find our lifestyle attractive to have the opportunity to discover as much as possible about orthodox Judaism. We want those who want to grow Jewishly through means other than orthodox Judaism to be inspired to do that. In the future, all passionate Jews will participate in this kind of kiruv; the denominational lines will be blurred as we are all partners in the future of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>I see the future of kiruv as a time where we are all working towards expanding our circles of Jewish relationships. It will be a time where positive Jewish experiences are the goal and we can measure success by the experience and not yeshiva enrollments.</p>
<p>There is reason to he hopeful that this model can become the standard. It will take restraint from the donors and careful hiring of the right kind of kiruv professionals. It can be done, it must be done, it will be done, and we will all be better for it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6654" alt="270209_reachingout" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/270209_reachingout.jpg?resize=300%2C200" data-recalc-dims="1" />We&#8217;ve covered Klal Perspectives here before. I think we will follow the same format as we did last time. I am going to highlight the one good article that I read in the journal in this post. Hopefully next week I will write my response to the Questions in this Klal Perspectives issue.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Klal Perspectives, here is the intro from my post on the previous issue:</p>
<p><em>Klal Perspectives is a great journal of articles written by orthodox Jewish rabbis and writers. The difference between Klal Perspectives and other journals is basically the content. KP is not a halacha journal. It is a practical journal.</em></p>
<p><em>The articles are not about well researched, fine nuances of Jewish law. The articles are about the issues that the orthodox community is facing and how to deal with them. Because the articles are not academic, they appeal to more people and more people are capable of writing articles for the journal. In a pleasing development, several articles have been authored by women. Lay-people are also featured as writers.</em></p>
<p>The issue being handled in this issue is Kiruv. The questions are pretty specific but the goal is to discuss <em>&#8220;varying approaches to outreach currently being pursued, and the appropriateness of the current allocation of communal resources as among these alternative strategies and focuses.&#8221;<span id="more-6653"></span></em></p>
<p>The journal does not agree upon a definition for the word Kiruv but I think they generally define it as bringing non-orthodox Jews to mitzvah observance.</p>
<p>Honestly, the responses that I read were pretty depressing. The articles did not really answer the questions that they were asked to answer. This is somewhat typical of Kiruv in general, as the entire field is not really very into using data and statistics. There were barely any footnotes in the articles I read. To me, this means that the writers are writing from their hearts and minds, but not from a place of hard data. That&#8217;s fine, but it is qualitatively different than well researched writing. Most of the articles I read sounded more like sermons, or divrei Torah than journal articles. That&#8217;s also fine, but I think that reflects poorly on the Kiruv field. Yet, it rings true to my ears, in the sense that the Kiruv profession, for better or worse, is not really about data, numbers, efficiency of resources, or other more modern metrics.</p>
<p>None of the articles I read actually discussed the issues of proving God&#8217;s existence or the veracity of the Torah. One article acknowledged the challenges of Biblical Criticism, but said nothing about how to meet the challenge. It&#8217;s almost as if the Kiruv professionals who wrote articles are not aware that belief in God and Torah from Sinai is not as easy as it sounds. Perhaps, the reason Kiruv seems to be floundering is because we can&#8217;t get past first base!</p>
<p>One article stood out. Rabbi Ilan Feldman wrote more about the orthodox Jewish community than about Kiruv per se, but his observations are right on the money.</p>
<p>His basic point is that the success of orthodox Judaism actually harms Kiruv. Our communities are large, intimidating, and have become focused on observance above being what he calls &#8220;model communities&#8221;. We are more careful about chumros and precision in halacha and hashkafa that it detracts from our appeal. Further, our success permits untrue stereotypes about our non-orthodox comrades to develop and reach levels of acceptance that they are considered normal.</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman relates a powerful story about the time he joined a mission of Federation style Jews (read = non-orthodox) as a way of trying to build a bridge between the respective communities. Throughout the trip he had to make many sacrifices and concessions all while not getting offended by the ignorance of orthodox Judaism exhibited throughout the trip. By the end of the trip his trip-mates warmed up to him and they had great conversations while getting to know each other pretty well. He felt that he was successful in dispelling many of the unfair or erroneous assumptions about orthodox Judaism by going on the trip.</p>
<p>This is not an unfamiliar script. It happens all the time. But the part that hit home for me, and elicited a tear in the corner of my eye was this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But the one who was most transformed on that trip was me.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What I expected to encounter was a group of 200 Jews devoid of feelings for Israel or religion. What I discovered instead were 200 very religious, spiritual, passionately devoted, proud Jews who knew very little about Torah and who lacked a Jewish vocabulary, but who loved their Jewish brethren in Israel, respected holiness and possessed a passion for Judaism as they knew it that rivaled the passion I had seen in my frum friends. In short, I learned to respect them. And I learned that “secular” Jews are often very religious Jews who do not know ritual, and whose devotion and willingness to sacrifice for the Judaism they do know is inspiring. By the time we parted ways, I actually loved them. Once I made this discovery, I was both surprised and embarrassed that it was new to me.</em></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is so true. In some orthodox circles, the non-orthodox are heathen, God hating, anti-Semites. This is a lie. Maybe part of why Kiruv has become so hard is because they know what we think of them&#8230;</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman then returns to the point about our communities focusing more on observance than being models. When combined with our arrogance about our own observance our ignorance about non-orthodox Jews creates this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Picture an emotionally and financially secure, successful, well-educated head of household who lives in a world in which wisdom is respected, volunteering over the weekend is considered a wonderful way to spend one’s time, wholesome family activities on Saturday afternoon are seen as a healthy way of building character. Ask him to join a world in which routine Shabbos-table talk argues in favor of Torah by disparaging secular wisdom, in which political candidates are assessed purely on selfish concerns of the religious community, with little concern for their impact on broader society. Not only is this sort of talk distinctly unattractive, it is not the talk of giants; it obscures the sense of responsibility, compassion and awe for G-d’s children that Avraham Avinu left as his legacy to his descendants.</em></p>
<p>Again. Wow.</p>
<p>But it is true. Orthodox Jews are led to believe that non-orthodox Jews and non-Jews are flailing about in the God-forsaken secular world. They are up the creek without a paddle. If only they would see the beauty of orthodox Judaism, they would be like thirsty camels drinking from the cool waters of our oasis of Torah. But that&#8217;s not the way it is. People are doing just fine without religion, and we are not always doing just fine with religion. We need to change how we view them and more importantly we need to change ourselves.</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman offers a hopeful alternative vision.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Orthodox Jews would be sufficiently secure with their own Yiddishkeit to invite their neighbors and co-workers to their homes, because the language of fear will have been replaced by a language of connection and confidence. Orthodox Jews would lead lives of idealism that extend beyond their own religious needs, inevitably becoming role models and attractive examples of lifestyle to non-observant Jews. Families will make life decisions informed by the religious needs of Klal Yisrael, not exclusively their own. Young couples will be recognized as an invaluable resource in a battle for the spiritual lives of all Jews, and will be encouraged to choose where to reside based upon where their presence would most greatly enhance Judaism, rather than merely their own religious comforts.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Because Orthodoxy would authentically and profoundly respect people, Orthodox community leaders would develop a reputation for selfless devotion to the good of the broader community, rather than solely parochial interests. For example, communal leadership will be invested in ensuring strong public schools in their neighborhoods, even though their own constituencies attend only yeshivas.</em></p>
<p>Notice the subtle criticism of the orthodox establishment? I honestly think this criticism is spot on. But there is hope. In Rabbi Feldman&#8217;s opinion, with the proper attitudes in place, we become a more attractive destination for passionate Judaism among the non-orthodox. I agree. This is what it would look like:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Non-observant Jews will be welcomed by their frum neighbors in both large frum communities as well as in evolving frum neighborhoods, and frum Jews will be more than welcome into their neighborhoods by the non-Orthodox, eruv and all, because Orthodox people would be known to be ideal neighbors: friendly, non-judgmental, and interested in the needs of others.</em></p>
<p>We can dream, right?</p>

I noted the excellent article written by Moishe Bane and recommended that everyone read it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/24/klal-perspectives-spring-2012-one-excellent-article-stands-out-from-the-rest/" target="_blank">Klal Perspectives Spring 2012: One Excellent Article Stands Out From the Rest</a>)</p>
<p>I mentioned in passing that I had my own response to some of the issues that were discussed in the journal.</p>
<p><a href="http://klalperspectives.org/spring-2012/spring-12-questions/" target="_blank">Writers were asked to address three questions</a>. They are more fully developed on the Klal Perspectives site. These are the questions in general terms:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>How accurate is the perception that there is a crisis in the degree of religious fulfillment experienced by observant Jews?</em></li>
<li><em>What is the source of this alienation and what can be done to cure it?</em></li>
<li><em> Are there proven methods to inspire observant Jews experiencing a gap in religious enthusiasm?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-5544"></span></p>
<p>I begin with three short answers. 1. Fairly accurate. 2. Modernity and a fresh approach. 3. No.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Judaism of the Future</h2>
<div>
<p>In my personal experience, I have come across a lot of people that would somewhat fit into this broad category. All of them know others in the same situation as well. So I would say the numbers are higher than just the number of people I know of personally. Of those people, there is a general feeling of malaise about religion. Some are apathetic to their plight and others are anguished by it. The apathetic ones are resigned to a marginalized relationship with God and their religion. The ones in anguish wish they could turn back the clock to their yeshiva days when they felt something special or they dream of living up to the lofty goals of <em>dveykus</em> and spiritual nirvana.</p>
<p>I think there is a need to discuss this issue. It is a legitimate problem and is definitely causing discomfort among many orthodox Jews. Would I call it a crisis? I don&#8217;t know. What is of greater concern is that the issue is framed as an issue of <em>perception</em>. The question implies that happy, fulfilled orthodox Jews are looking at others and are concerned that others are not feeling fulfilled. That is what perception means. I would prefer if the question focused on the actual people who are feeling burnt out of religion and not the assumptions or judgments of others. So I would rather adjust the question to: Is there a significant group of orthodox Jews who feel under-fulfilled by their Judaism?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is undoubtedly, yes.</p>
<p>The more interesting question is the second question. Where does this spiritual melancholy come from?</p>
<p>It was hard to pinpoint a consensus among the journal writers on this point. Most of the writers attributed the problem to a flaw or misstep in <em>Avodas Hashem </em>(religious observance). As I remarked in a previous post, Moishe Bane pointed more toward phenomena outside Mitzvah observance that affect one&#8217;s spiritual psyche. While I agree in form, I have a different twist on the substance. I think there is something that is being overlooked in these discussions and that is the historical context of orthodox Judaism&#8217;s rise and its place in the modern world.</p>
<p>Taking a big step back and looking at orthodox Judaism from a bird&#8217;s eye view gives one an interesting perspective of theology in orthodox Judaism. We have the canonized books of Tanach. The stories in Tanach are replete with miracles, Divine communications with people, complex heroes and villains, struggles with idol worship, violence and war, and stories of high drama. The lens with which these stories are viewed in orthodox Judaism is through the lens of <em>Chazal</em> and then through the eyes of the <em>Rishonim</em> who elucidate the teachings of <em>Chazal</em>.</p>
<p>Then we have the <em>Mishnah</em>, <em>Talmud</em>, various <em>midrashic</em> sources, and their numerous commentaries. The world of <em>Chazal</em> was also a fantastic world that talks of miracles brought about through acts of the saintly <em>Tannaim</em> and <em>Amoraim</em>, an awareness of angels and demons, a hybrid of folk medicine, real medicine, and faith healing, and many other ideas and expressions that were appropriate for Ancient Greece and the medieval era.</p>
<p>More recently, we have the writings of the <em>Arizal</em> and his students. Somewhat related, we have the works of the <em>baalei</em> <em>mussar</em> and the <em>Chassidus</em> which paralleled it. These teachings focus on a transcendental version of Judaism. Their focus on perfection of character and mind, hearkens the typology of a superJew. The person who is complete control of his life, thoughts, and actions. All of it with cosmic proportions. One misstep and worlds are affected. The ultimate goal of these works is to elevate the Jew from man to [almost] angel. But the payoffs are lofty. <em>Ruach</em> <em>HaKodesh</em>, understanding dreams, granting blessings that come true, and practical mystic powers are part and parcel of this genre.</p>
<p>Throughout the last 2000 years, various codes of halacha have been codified as well. The primary sources used today are the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> and the <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Brurah</em> on <em>Orach</em> <em>Chaim</em>. The status of halacha has been cemented for several hundred years. To be lenient, based on a <em>rishon</em> or <em>gaon</em> not quoted in the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> is considered unacceptable. Removing statutes that were based on mistakes or assumptions that have been shown to be incorrect is not really permissible. Historical social norms that helped establish <em>halacha</em> are not considered when analyzing <em>halacha</em> today.</p>
<p>I believe this is a fair overview of the basic corpus of Torah that is studied today by orthodox Jews. I also believe that the descriptions of those general bases of knowledge are accurate and I do not mean them in a disrespectful or cynical way. At all.</p>
<p>But herein lies the problem, I think.</p>
<p>The kind of life a Jew expects his religion to provide for him is completely unrealistic in modern terms. We are not going to debate or discuss the veracity or meaning of the fantastic claims made in each of these genres of Torah study. But we are going to assume that this is the world the average orthodox Jew associates with his religion. Years of studying about open miracles, direct communication with God, demons, angels, mystical universes affected by man&#8217;s acts, practical kabbalistic feats, and the like, has an effect on the one doing the studying. Its effect is that the person associates the religion with these things.</p>
<p>We hear about stories of great Jewish leaders who made incredible things happen. Whether it is Choni HaMa&#8217;agel (drawing a circle and demanding rain &#8211; and it worked), Reb Yochanan (turning people into bags of bones with his eyes), Rashi (born after his father tossed a diamond to the sea), Reb Yehuda HaChassid (the wall that moved to save his life), the Baal Shem Tov (flying around Europe), The Arizal (locating ancient graves by &#8220;sense&#8221;), my great-great-grandfather Reb Elya Lopian (meeting Eliyahu HaNavi), or the Chazon Ish (knowing how to do brain surgery) all these stories reinforce the idea that Jews can do supernatural things if we could just get to that level.</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews are generally smart, well educated (at least in comparison with the majority of the rest of the world), come from good, balanced homes, and are generally part of the middle to upper class of society. In my experience, most people who believe the type of legends, stories, and anecdotes that are taught in yeshivos are less advanced in every other way.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain. In ancient times <em>everybody</em> believed the kinds of things that are described in the Talmud. In medieval times <em>everyone </em>believed in the kinds of things the <em>rishonim</em> speak of. In early modern times <em>almost everybody</em> believed in the same kinds of things we find in <em>mussar</em> <em>seforim</em> and <em>chassidus</em>. The folk cures and superstitions that have crept into <em>halacha</em> were <em>common for the people of their time</em>. Today, the only people who still believe such things are looked at as backward or relics of the past.</p>
<p>I am not using this analysis to judge whether these things are true or whether they are essential to our religion. I am only making the following point: Many of the very basic assumptions of orthodox Jews were prevalent in the rest of the world, each in their time, but they have been discarded by smart, successful, happy people in the non-orthodox Jewish world. They <em>used to believe </em>in similar ideas and stories, but they <em>no longer</em> believe in them.</p>
<p>In other words, it used to be <em>normal</em> to believe in these fantastic abilities and tales. <em>Everyone did it.</em> This was their way of  life. It could be explained by pointing to all the unanswered questions that are prevalent in their understanding of the universe. They had no better explanation for various phenomena. Rather they had to believe in the supernatural on a regular basis. God was responsible for everything because they had no other explanation. But now, it is only religious fanatics, naive people, those who live in undeveloped countries and other indigenous groups that still have maintain these kinds of fundamentalist beliefs because for the most part, they are either wrong or unnecessary.</p>
<p>At this point, the orthodox Jew, is confronted with two basic options. Either the beliefs of orthodox Judaism that go against modern sensibilities are true and the beliefs that everyone who was not an orthodox Jew, which were nearly identical in substance and identical in form, were not true in the first place, so it is still reasonable to believe and this is an example of the people of the world &#8220;not getting it&#8221;. <em>Or</em>, orthodox Jews and everyone else believed in the same kinds of things a long time ago, the fact that society as a whole has moved on is indicative that the beliefs are flawed and perhaps many of them are untrue.</p>
<p>Again, I am only pointing to the options, and not to the validity of either position. I am merely stating what I believe are the reasonable options available to a modern Jew when considering traditional orthodox Jewish beliefs in our modern times.</p>
<p>To me, this is the underlying, unexpressed issue that lies beneath the surface and causes the most internal angst and frustration with regard to spiritual success. The goals are impossible to achieve. None of my friends from yeshiva have <em>ruach</em> <em>hakodesh</em>. None of my <em>rebbeim</em> from yeshiva perform miracles. The universe of our heroes simply does not exist anymore. None of us has experienced or witnessed the kinds of things that are such an integral part of our lore.</p>
<p>Yet, the majority of what we learn today was borne out of that universe. The kind of relationship <em>they </em>had with the Almighty is not able to be reproduced in a modern society. Whereas, every nook and cranny of life was a connection to something Greater, due to a lack of sophistication or flawed understanding of science or a general mood of superstition, the world in which they lived was a world where God was found in everything at all times. It was so easy. In those days, it was stupid to <em>not s</em>ee God in everything. But in our modern times, where we have answers to many questions, we have reasonable explanations for many things that were mysterious in the past, where we know that superstition is bunk, all that seems so distant, so impossible, and so different from our world.</p>
<p>This causes one of two things to happen. For some people, the ideals become too lofty. &#8220;Oy, I&#8217;ll never find the supernatural in my life.&#8221; If all your life you&#8217;ve been striving for something that simply does not happen anymore, the frustration is going to be overwhelming. The result is apathy toward religion.</p>
<p>But for others, the skeptics among us, it can cause people to throw out the baby with the bathwater. It all goes down the drain. &#8220;If Chazal were wrong about some things, maybe they were wrong about everything.&#8221; If our religion has similar characteristics to ancient pagan cults, to other religions, and to medieval folklore, which parts are &#8220;real&#8221;? These people will by and large either leave orthodoxy, become orthoprax, or live in the agony of what they believe to be two mutually exclusive truths.</p>
<p>If I were asked to point at what I believed to be causing spiritual malaise among Klal Yisrael, I would point to this. The idea that our religion has so many characteristics that are similar to clearly false beliefs and that the world of our religious heroes is a world that for the most part, no longer exists.</p>
<p>So what is the cure?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not simple nor is it something that I see happening anytime soon. But I think that R&#8217; Soleveitchik was on the right path in this regard. A new, modern understanding of Judaism and our culture needs to be cultivated. We cannot base our theology on ancient Greek methodologies, or Muslim and Christian approaches from the Middle Ages. If we are confident that we have the truth, and I believe we do, we must believe that it is can be reconciled with modernity with absolute fealty to the words of Chazal which are binding and the halacha that flows from those words. I am not advocating that we abandon halachic Judaism, <em>chas v&#8217;shalom</em>. I am advocating for a new approach to Torah that uses modern ideas <em>much in the same way Chazal used ideas from their time </em>and all the great Jewish thinkers over the last 2000 years up until recently.</p>
<p>It can start with our education system and approach to the non-orthodox and to the non-Jews in our world. We have transplanted a model from a time of blood libels, of pogroms, and of Jew hatred, that led to the Holocaust in Europe and are trying to implement it in a free, safe, and friendly United States of America. It&#8217;s just more of the same. We can&#8217;t expect those models to work anymore. It&#8217;s a brave new world. It&#8217;s a <em>different </em>world. And just as we can&#8217;t expect that style of <em>chinuch </em>(education) to work on these shores, we can&#8217;t expect that what inspired and fascinated a water carrier or a farmer in Europe circa 1730 would inspire and fascinate an accountant or an attorney today.</p>
<p>On an individual level, I strongly recommend that people trying to find their place in orthodox Judaism by finding the things that they like. Exploit them. Enjoy them. Focus on what makes you feel good religiously and what inspires you. All the while, maintaining strict adherence to <em>halacha</em> and conforming to the standards of one&#8217;s community. But don&#8217;t expect the kinds of returns that our great-great-grandparents had. It was a different world with different challenges. What you should expect is that you can have a <em>2012 type of relationship with God and Judaism.</em> Set that kind of realistic goal and a lot of disappointment and apathy can be avoided.</p>
<p>I really believe that this is not only possible, but necessary. I think we can do it and that we must do it. Each era of Judaism had its challenges and configured a form of orthodox, <em>halachic</em> Judaism to meet those challenges all while remaining strictly adherent to the <em>daled amos shel halacha</em>. We can do the same for the future of our Judaism. We can move past the model of early modern history based on the romanticization of European pre-war shtetl life and forge our own beautiful, successful, passionate orthodox Judaism of the future.</p>
<p>To answer the third question, this method is not proved to work. It is a suggestion that I am confident has some merit. I hope that we can make the adjustments that we need to ensure that our children and grandchildren feel a similar, yet different passion, as our parents and grandparents did before us. I think we can.</p>

The difference between Klal Perspectives and other journals is basically the content. KP is not a halacha journal. It is a practical journal.</p>
<p>The articles are not about well researched, fine nuances of Jewish law. The articles are about the issues that the orthodox community is facing and how to deal with them. Because the articles are not academic, they appeal to more people and more people are capable of writing articles for the journal. In a pleasing development, several articles have been authored by women. Lay-people are also featured as writers.</p>
<p>I loved the first issue in the fall. I was less impressed with the third issue in the winter. In the spring issue that was recently published the journal found its groove once again.</p>
<p>Each issue faces a specific topic or challenge. The authors are invited to respond with their best ideas and draw from their personal and professional experience.</p>
<p>I always enjoy Rabbi Adlerstein&#8217;s writing and his work in Klal Perspectives does not disappoint. But the best two articles of the three issues were written by one man. Both of his articles were incredibly insightful and innovative. That man is Moishe Bane.<span id="more-5425"></span></p>
<p>Perhaps one day we will revisit his first article. While the spring issue is still fresh I wanted to invite everyone to read his article in this issue. The challenge being discussed in the spring issue is in the words of Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zweibel: <em>&#8220;the increasing numbers from across the spectrum who feel no meaningful connection to Hashem, His Torah, or even His people.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Most of the article I read accepted this premise and thought of ideas that could be implemented by tinkering with the existing system and model. Moishe Bane did not do that.</p>
<p>His article basically rationalizes and almost justifies the skepticism and burnt-outedness of many orthodox Jews. But his solution is not to read more books, read different books, go to different classes, sing more, etc. et al. His ideas are to rebuild the orthodox Jewish community. His solution is a social one. And I could not agree more.</p>
<p>He encourages us to take pride on our community and to ensure that there is a community worthy of our pride:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Jews’ identification with the observant Jewish community is sustainable only if the community is a source of pride. If community conduct and ethical standards are compromised, many will abandon their social allegiance, ultimately resulting in a theological abandonment, as well. These are the fundamental principles of chillul Hashem, and the implications are enormous. Ethical business practices, family harmony, and basic menchlichkeit must become hallmarks of being a frum Jew, as one would expect authentic Torah to mandate. If accomplished, frum Jews could then take pride in their community, and see the community’s values as demarcations with which to identify.</em></p>
<p>Further, he implores us to interact socially. Do things together with other orthodox Jews. Have friends. Real friends:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There must be a renewed emphasis on deepening the basic social connections between members of the Orthodox community. The importance of friendships with others who share one’s values must be emphasized and facilitated. Time spent with others within the community must be encouraged. It is critical that the expansive role that observant people play in their professional and business environments does not redefine them socially, as well. Connecting with G-d begins with connecting to Klal Yisrael, and these efforts must be forged through shuls, schools and other communal organizations. Attending shiurim or learning in chaburas often provide the needed camaraderie, as do chesed endeavors, but not all Jews have access to these opportunities. Ordinary social interaction, per se, among frum Jews must also play a critical role. </em></p>
<p>I would only add that part of the reason social interaction is so minimized and difficult is because of financial pressures and strain, large families, over-hyped tznius concerns, among other non-essential beliefs and practices. We can also attempt to treat the source of this malady and not simply treat the symptoms.</p>
<p>Please read the article. Comment on it here or anywhere if you have reactions and thoughts.</p>
<p>I intend to write my own response to this challenge. I think I have a different perspective than the other writers and my ideas about this subject are certainly not conventional. Hopefully I will be able to write it up soon.</p>
