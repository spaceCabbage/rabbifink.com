				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peace has descended upon southern Israel. The war is over. Finally. Hopefully. No more rockets flying overhead. No more air strikes on Hamas targets. No more artillery battles in urban Gaza neighborhoods. Hopefully, the underground tunnel terror network is impotent by now.</p>
<p>We can all breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The worst time for the public to analyze the cost and benefit of a war is during a war. Emotions are high. Armchair analysts have almost no way of influencing war policy and the analysis is undoubtedly missing key data and driven purely by ideology. But now that it’s over, I think it’s time to ask <em>the</em> question. There is only one question to ask now.</p>
<p><em>Was it worth it?</em></p>
<p><span id="more-8676"></span></p>
<p>The only way to answer this question is to establish the status before the war, then establish the status after the war, and then establish the cost of getting from the former to the latter.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/07/was-the-war-in-gaza-worthwhile/israel-palestinian-gaza-conflict/" rel="attachment wp-att-8678"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8678" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/532217197.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN-GAZA-CONFLICT" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Two months ago, there was relative quiet in the region. A kidnapping and murder in June changed everything. Israel responded, Hamas escalated, and suddenly we were at war. Hundreds of people were killed. Lives have been changed forever. War comes at a great cost. For people like me, who want to avoid that cost unless absolutely necessary, the war became a great internal moral struggle.</p>
<p>All I could think about, was <em>how many Israeli lives were lost in the war? How many innocent Palestinians were lost? </em><em>Are those numbers higher or lower than the number of lives that would have been lost if there had been no war?</em></p>
<p>To me, that is the only thing matters.</p>
<p>It bothered me enough to do some research. From 2005-2007, four Israeli citizens were killed by Hamas terror attacks. During Operation Cast Lead in 2008, Hamas rockets killed three Israeli citizens. In 2011, Hamas militants murdered six Israeli civilians and another was killed following Israel’s immediate response. The subsequent Operation Returning Echo saw zero Israeli civilian casualties. Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 saw the death of four more Israeli citizens. Three yeshiva students were kidnapped and murdered in June 2014 and three more Israelis were killed during the war.</p>
<p>In all, Hamas or their affiliates have killed 23 innocent Israeli civilians in the last decade. This is an unacceptable number. The only acceptable number is zero.</p>
<p>Israel championed the terror victims admirably. Vowing to neuter Hamas, the IDF has operated in Gaza several times over the last decade. During these incursions, dozens of Israeli soldiers have died. Several thousand Palestinians, innocent and guilty, have been killed.</p>
<p>We return to our initial question. Have we reduced the total number of deaths with these efforts? Or have we increased the total number of deaths? Or is it too uncertain?</p>
<p>Again, I ask this question, because it’s the only question that matters. War is a last resort for Israel and it can only justify war if the fighting will reduce death. Israel calls its army a Defense Force for a reason.</p>
<p>Prior to the discovery of the tunnel terror network, I privately feared that the war was actually causing more death than it was sparing. The status quo didn’t seem so terrible. But the war was taking the lives of far too many soldiers and Palestinian civilians. Their blood is just as red as the rest of us. I didn’t think it was fair for soldiers and innocents in Gaza to die unless their death was part of a cause that was saving the lives of others. Every time a soldier was pronounced dead, I flinched in pain. Every time I heard of the civilian casualties in Gaza, I shuddered.  It didn’t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Then we found the tunnels. The tunnels justify everything. A well-organized terror operation would have killed thousands of innocent Israelis. It’s impossible to think that the extensive tunnel network was simply an elaborate underground system for smuggling goods into Gaza. It was almost certainly part of a plan to kill Israelis. Finding and destroying those tunnels cost us many lives. But it seems very likely that it saved far more lives.</p>
<p>War is terrible. I am extremely uncomfortable with war. The only way for me to reconcile war in my mind is to see the benefits of war outweighing the cost. For much of this conflict I wasn’t sure if the benefits outweighed the cost. Now I am sure.</p>
<p>Rest easy, my fellow doves. The war is over. And it was worth it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Young men and women are fighting for their lives and the safety of their families and their nation at this very moment. The IDF is in Gaza and we all hope and pray for their swift and safe return.</p>
<p>No matter one’s personal preference or opinion on Operation Protective Edge, too soft, too harsh, too quick, too slow, too whatever, those are our sons and daughters in harm’s way and we are united in our support of their sacrifice.</p>
<p>A verse in this week’s Torah portion so purely expresses the emotions of many Diaspora Jews with an eye on Israel.<span id="more-8637"></span> First noted by Rabbi Efrem Goldberg of the Boca Raton Synagogue, when I saw this verse isolated from its context, and standing on its own, the words resonated strongly with me. The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Menashe preferred to stay on the east bank of the Jordan rather than cross the Jordan and enter the land of Canaan. Moses chastised them. Their brothers will be fighting wars of conquest in Canaan! &#8220;האחיכם יבואו למלחמה ואתם תשבו פה” &#8211; “will your brothers enter into battle and you will remain here?!”<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/07/18/you-can-help-the-idf/soldats-tsahal/" rel="attachment wp-att-8641"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8641" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/soldats-tsahal.jpg?w=980" alt="soldats-tsahal" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>That’s how it feels. Our brothers and sisters have entered into battle, and we are marooned in our homes and communities living vicariously through their courageous efforts. Appreciating the verse doesn’t mean that we can do anything about it. It doesn’t mean that I actually wish I could jump on a plane and put on an IDF uniform. It is, however, a lovely metaphor that describes the feelings of helplessness and guilt-ridden comfort I feel so many miles away.</p>
<p>Wallowing in my desperation, I remember an email I received this afternoon from my uncle Rabbi Pesach Lerner. I was working when the email infiltrated my inbox and only gave it half a glance. But now, in my anxiety filled reverie I realized it was time to take a second look.</p>
<p>The email described a program initiated by Rav Simcha Kook, Chief Rabbi of Rehovot, called “<a href="http://theshmiraproject.com">The Shmira Project</a>.” Active duty soldiers and registered civilians are randomly paired. The soldier is given the name of the civilian and vice versa. When the soldier is on the battlefield, the soldier will think of the soldier’s pair and fight on their behalf. When the civilian is living their civilian life, the civilian will do good deeds on behalf of the soldier. All the while, both are aware of their counterparts and their partner’s efforts on their behalf. It’s simple and simply beautiful.</p>
<p>There are those who subscribe to the religious belief that the merits of the good deeds will protect the soldiers. Accordingly, the shmira, protection, is spiritual and very real. Others attribute the protection to the soldier knowing that there is someone thinking about the soldier and hoping for the soldier’s success. It can be very powerful to know that one is not alone. The Shmira Project tells every matched soldier that there is a specific person out there, somewhere, who is doing good deeds on their behalf. Conversely, the civilian knows that there is a soldier who is benefitting from their partnership and this can connect the civilian to the battlefield in a magnificent way.</p>
<p>I decided to sign up. I navigated to their website, read the literature, and was ready to go. It was very easy to register and I entered all the necessary information. When I clicked to submit my name and information, the website gave me a name of my partner soldier. I read his name. <em>Achira ben Nira</em>. Then it happened. I started to cry. This was completely unexpected. But seeing that name in black and white made me feel so much closer to the battlefield. I am certain that when he sees my name, he will feel a sense of unity and belonging to the Jewish people because some person on the other side of the world is thinking about him and doing good deeds on his behalf.</p>
<p>People want to know what they can do to help the IDF. We want to participate. We want to contribute to the cause. There are practical suggestions like sending care packages and food items, or sending games and writing letters. I support all these ideas and more. The soldiers need basic supplies and we can provide many of those items.</p>
<p>I think there is also value in seemingly non-practical suggestions. There is something special about expressing solidarity and offering human connection to people who are living on the edge. Love and appreciation can provide great strength to anyone. Isolated and lonely soldiers need it even more. If you believe in the spiritual protection of good deeds, that’s obviously a superb way to contribute.</p>
<p>I suggest that we all sign up for The Shmira Project. Adopt a soldier. Remember your soldier’s name. Do good deeds on your soldier’s behalf. Connect with that perfect stranger who needs our spiritual and psychological support during life threatening combat. Be part of this effort. Don’t just sit on the sidelines. I thought being paired would be just a procedural formality. Instead, seeing that name, <em>Achira ben Nira</em>, moved me deeply. I can only hope you will feel something similar to what I felt. But I know in my heart how much it means to A<em>chira ben Nira</em>.</p>

<p>Israel is at war with Hamas. I find myself in a familiar position. That is, unable to comprehend the entire concept of war.</p>
<p>I am not writing this to question to need or wisdom of the current operation in Gaza. That is not the point here. But when my brothers and sisters are in harm&#8217;s way, I cannot but help and wonder about the concept of war.</p>
<p><strong>I want to be very clear</strong>, I support Israel and its right to defend itself. I am urging my congregation and family to have Israel in our prayers. Last night our <a href="http://daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">Daf Yomi</a> class was dedicated to the safety and security of our brothers and sisters in Israel. That does not mean I can&#8217;t have a discussion about war. I do not intend to minimize the importance or sacrifice of those involved in the current conflict. This is very much a theoretical discussion.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6473" title="Peaceteken1a" alt="" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Peaceteken1a.jpg?resize=300%2C199" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is going to be short and to the point. Here are my primary issues with war:<span id="more-6471"></span></p>
<p>It seems to me that the only thing a war proves or accomplishes is that one group can be established as physically stronger or better strategists than the other group. War does not set morality or determine which group is more fit to exist (except in the Darwinian sense). The victors of the war get safety and security until someone bigger and badder than they are start up with them.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the  people fighting the war, as in the soldiers, are fighting a war for their parents. I don&#8217;t think 18 year old kids are old enough to appreciate the gravity of war. I don&#8217;t think many of them would choose to fight the war. But they are sent into harm&#8217;s way by people of authority, while those people who are making the decisions are mostly out of harm&#8217;s way. I don&#8217;t have a better alternative, but the inequity here is great.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the groups at war should be able to resolve their issues without killing one another. I know it sounds idealistic to believe this, but I honestly believe that people have the capacity to love and care for anyone. If we would spent a quarter of the resources that are used for fighting, and reallocate those resources to creating mutual experiences and friendships we would be much better off. People don&#8217;t go to war with their friends. The world is big enough for everyone to have a place in it. Yes, there are places that multiple groups want, but people know how to compromise with their friends.</p>
<p>The entire idea that since I am born in Place A and you are born in Place B means that I am right and you are wrong is something that does not fit in with modern thinking. If I was born in Gaza, I am sure I would sympathize more with Gaza. If a member of Hamas was born in Tel Aviv he would feel differently too. In other words, these convictions and affiliations that create friction are a fiction of our own creation. Why should it matter where on is born? That&#8217;s no fault of our own. We can&#8217;t control these affiliations for the most part, and so it seems borderline insane to place so much stock in these affiliations.</p>
<p>I really wish that younger, less entrenched, more idealistic people from both sides of any conflict could come together and show their leaders that they prefer peace to war. That they prefer friendship over hatred.</p>
<p>I guess, the overall point here is that when analyzed, war is pretty senseless. I understand that sometimes events that are out of our control force our hand and we find ourselves in open conflict. I just feel that if humanity could understand this, we would be a lot better off and we could focus on the progress of humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>I cry for the victims of terror. I cry for innocent civilians in Gaza who are caught in the crossfire. I cry for the families that are under constant threat of violence. I cry for people born into the worst of situations, as they are in Gaza. I cry for children who are taught that the only way out of their struggle is violence. I cry for people who feel oppressed and see no way out of their predicament. I cry for people who inherited an almost impossible to resolve problem. I cry for all of them. But most of all, I cry that we cannot resolve our differences without death and violence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3716" title="the-future" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg?resize=300%2C239" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you&#8217;ve known me for a little while you know I am an optimist. If we&#8217;ve talked about the conflict in the Middle East you know I am optimistic about that too.</p>
<p>For a little while now (at least a couple of years) I have maintained that the conflict will in effect, resolve itself, eventually.</p>
<p>Until recently, Gazans and West Bank Palestinians have heard one voice. A voice that told them in categorical terms that their life would be better under autonomous rule by Hamas or the PLO. Palestinians believed them. It created fanatics, fascists and suicide bombers. But people can only be told a lie so long as there is no evidence to the contrary.<span id="more-3710"></span></p>
<p>If someone tells you that the world is flat you know he is lying because you have information that shows him to be lying. Information is king. Therefore, I have contended that my generation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y" target="_blank">Generation Y</a>) is the information generation. My generation does not accept lies or legends at face value. We know there is a way to learn on our own to unmask lies passed off as facts or legends passed off as history. We are the Wikipedia generation. We know that the information is available and we are willing to find it ourselves.</p>
<p>So long as information can be controlled, the public will kneel to authority, corrupt or otherwise. But once information is freely available to the masses, the lies unravel, the legends are exposed and truth can prevail. Authority that told those lies and legends is discarded and the people want truth, a voice and democracy. I have been saying that my generation of Palestinians and Muslims in general who have access to information will undoubtedly prefer to join the West in its freedoms, capitalism and democracy.</p>
<p>When the choices are death or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is easy. When the choice is money, entertainment, enlightenment or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is even easier. With the wave of unbridled information entering the oppressed masses in Arab countries, fundamental fanaticism will be replaced with a thirst for information and the allure of modern civilization. A lifestyle of books and e-books, Facebook and Twitter, Playstation and XBOX, e-commerce and ebay sure as heck beats a Third World existence. This is why my generation will resolve the conflict. Conflict serves no one but the elite and corrupt leaders. It will mean out with oppressive rulers and in with freedom.</p>
<p>The beginnings of this movement has already been formed in Gaza. A few weeks ago the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/02/free-gaza-youth-manifesto-palestinian" target="_blank">Guardian reported</a> on a &#8220;Manifesto&#8221; written by disgruntled Palestinians. They don&#8217;t want Hamas, they don&#8217;t want Fatah, they don&#8217;t want Israel, they want freedom.</p>
<p>What happened in Tunisia and what is happening right now in Egypt is more of the same. The people will not be controlled by corrupt Heads of State who demand allegiance for no reason other than &#8220;I said so&#8221;. The people want their freedom. They want what we have in the West. And they will get it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/28/president-reagans-message-for-protesters-in-egypt/">President Reagan’s Message for the Protesters in Egypt</a>)</p>
<p>A little bit of patience and gentle prodding from the West will help the next generation of Arabs achieve their emancipation. I maintain that 9/11 was a final salvo. The fundamentalist establishment tried one last time to supress the free flow of information by trying to destroy it. They failed and freedom is around the corner.</p>
<p>Just ask the protestors in Tunisia and Egypt.</p>
<p>I do admit that the protests are not without flaws. It is entirely possible that the new leaders will be equally despotic as their predecessors. We can only hope that will not be the case. But even if it is, it won&#8217;t last long. Change is coming. The cat is out of the bag and freedom is like a drug that is addictive and readily available. The public won&#8217;t be satisfied until they can drink the elixir of freedom. And they will.</p>
<p>This phenomena has also affected the orthodox Jewish community. The more information that becomes available, the more the religious leaders are concerned about losing their authority. This is silly. The authority of rabbis was never binding except in a rabbinic court or perhaps via an uncontested responsa. It is a folly of this generation&#8217;s leadership (or its handlers) that asserted this unilateral power. It never existed and yes, with information this imagined power will disappear. This is why the Internet is so feared by these rabbis. That is why the Internet is banned in charedi circles. It is because of the information and free flow of ideas that the Internet provides which in turn minimizes their invented power. Orthodox Judaism does not depend on charismatic or authoritarian rabbis, it depends of individual commitment to Jewish law and theology. Information is a boon to that kind of religious practice. If we are confident in orthodox Judaism as a viable way of life, information must be a friend, not a foe. I know that I am confident, I can&#8217;t say the same for those who cower in fear from information.</p>
<p>The future is now, or coming soon enough. The Internet is giving people a thirst for freedom and independence. Totalitarianism cannot win against the almost infinite amount of information that is easily accessible from a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">device smaller</a> than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoPf98i8A0g" target="_blank">George Costanza&#8217;s wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Say hello to the future.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Normally I don&#8217;t like to tread the dangerous waters of politics. That is why you find no commentary on the current skirmish in Gaza. However I feel it necessary to mention that our thoughts and prayers are with Dov Dalin &#8211; Dov Chaim ben Masha Chana. Dov is the son of community members Gary and Marsha Dalin. He is a reserve in the Israel Defense Force and serves as a sniper in the paratroopers. He is currently being deployed to Gaza. We pray for his safe return and the success of his mission.</p>
<p>A war is on the news and in the papers &#8211; we don&#8217;t necessarily feel it. When we know someone fighting in the war &#8211; we feel it. Right now &#8211; I feel it.</p>
<p>Bracha V&#8217;Hatzlacha Dov!</p>
