				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another voice has entered the online discussion about Bible Criticism and orthodox Judaism. Professor Jacob L. Wright is an orthodox Jew who has studied, taught, and written extensively on Bible Criticism.</p>
<p>He made waves Pesach time when he published a provocative article on the Huffington Post where he talked about &#8220;The Myth of Moses.&#8221; In his article he explained that his view of the Bible is that it is a composite work with each layer added for a specific reason. In the Moses story, there was a need to justify the existence of an Egyptian prince named Moses who saved the Israelites and establish him as a bona fide Israelite. So the Bible tells the story of a boy who was cast off by his mother into the Nile. This story has very obscure references as the names of the major players in the story are not mentioned. Later, the story was viewed as salacious so new details were added as a prologue to the story.<span id="more-7473"></span></p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t the Bible and I weren&#8217;t orthodox, this would be a great theory to explain anomalies in the text. But it is the Bible and I am orthodox so it hardly sits well with me when the Bible is explained away as myth.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7475" alt="157328845" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/157328845-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p>Professor Wright was interview by Professor Alan Brill on his <a href="http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/interview-with-prof-jacob-wright-of-emory-university/" target="_blank">Kavvanah</a> website. The interview is worth your time and consideration if you don&#8217;t mind reading what is widely considered to be absolute kefira.</p>
<p>The first important thing in the interview is the introduction where Brill outlines the current status of Biblical Criticism. It&#8217;s required reading so I copy it in full here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As background, the problems of the Bible go back to the tenth and eleventh century Islamic critiques of the Bible by Ibn Hazm and others. Second, modern figures such as Spinoza and Jean Astruc sought to understand the Bible as a human book using the same tools that we use to understand Greek and Roman books. And in the 19th century, Wellhausen popularized a theory that the Pentateuch had four authors. But the important part of his theory was that the ritual and priestly material was a priestly Pharisaic digression from the original pure faith of the prophets necessitating Christianity for a restoration. Hence, Solomon Schechter called it higher anti-Semitism, David Zvi Hoffman showed that Leviticus is not in contradiction to the rest of the story, Kaufman showed that the prophets assumed the priestly material, and Cassuto showed based on Sumerian and Akkadian sources that the divisions fail.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Well, Wellhausen was writing a century ago, with the aforementioned defenses all formulated in a post WWI climate. For at least forty years the field was already given to authors such as Gunkel who assumes the Bible is legend, the way Gilgamesh is legend. And Martin Noth who assumed most of the narrative was formulated originally as oral traditions- read here. Questions of redaction were not tied to Wellhausen, or even literary documents, but to oral traditions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What do historians currently think about the context of the Bible? They assume that it was written between 720 BCE and 587 BCE, between the destruction of the Northern Kingdom destruction of Jerusalem, with some editing until the end of Ezra’s life circa 440 BCE. (Minimalists make it more recent and Evangelicals defend the chronological dates.) They work from parallels to Assyrian texts, the nature of script, linguistics, and reconstructed context of author. Little of this has anything to do with literary doublets. If you want to reject historical criticism, then start learning ancient linguistics and texts contemporary to the Bible. No harmonization of passages changes this dating nor does anything from Cassutto or Hoffman affect it. (However, Prof. Josh Berman is seeking to shift the discussion from Assyrians to the Hittites in 1300 BCE, an effort that may be accepted by the Orthodox but does not promise to have much of an impact on the experts. But it is better than refuting Kugel, who is not a historian of ancient Israel or source critic so the critique does not help.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This past May there was a major conference at Hebrew University on“Convergence and Divergence in Pentateuchal Theory;” if you are interested in these topics, then that was the place to be. The conference opened up with a clear statement that there are three approaches: a Documentary approach (not based on Wellhausen but on Noth and others) where there are separate documents; a Supplementary approach,where a single document get more and more complex; and a Fragmentary approach, where we cannot separate out authors or layers anymore.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally returning to Cassuto, he may have rejected Wellhausen but he accepted historical context, showing that all the numbers and genealogies in Genesis do not correspond to ages and events, rather are stylized number, ten generations, twelve children. He does this by reading the ancient parallels to the Biblical story.<br />
Wright answers Brill&#8217;s various questions and hte discussion is fascinating and worth your time.</p>
<p>However I would like to focus on the end of the interview. Here, Brill asks the million dollar question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>How can one be a shomer Torah uMizvot and accept historical criticism?</em></p>
<p>Wright basically dodges the question by attacking those who attack Biblical Criticism without a background in the field. He also reassures the reader that there are plenty of scholars who are shomer Torah u&#8217;Mitzvos. Wright reiterates the question and fails to provide a sufficient answer. If anything his answer strengthens the question. He answers that he is in awe of the authors of the Bible. Their genius makes it a compelling work. In conclusion the Torah is authoritative but not divine.</p>
<p>I tried to follow up in the comments and ask why anyone would feel compelled to adhere to an ancient man made book of rules. Wright replied that the Torah as divine origins but is not divine. I was eventually directed to Gideon Slifkin&#8217;s Facebook page where Wright says he went into more detail. I followed instructions but the discussion there did not deliver.</p>
<p>This is the crux of the issue. In mainstream frum circles today, from Satmar and Lakewood to YU and Merkaz HaRav, the assumption is that if the Torah is not approximately 99.99% of what God gave Moses at Sinai then people would not keep the Torah. That is the basic assumption. The fear of Bible Criticism is that it assumes (or even purports to prove) that the Torah is not 100% divine. Some scholars say it&#8217;s 0% divine, but that is not a necessary assumption to Bible Criticism. The only way Bible Criticism will ever be accepted in mainstream frum circles is if this assumption about keeping the Torah changes. If this assumption is replaced with the assumption that people will keep the Torah even if the Torah we have today is a composite work based on an original divine revelation at Sinai then the fear of Bible Criticism disappears.</p>
<p>As an aside, I see no reason to think that this assumption (i.e. that even if God is not responsible for 100% of the Torah we would keep the Torah) could not work. We keep plenty of things that are not from God. We keep all the Rabbinic Mitzvos and many customs on top of those as well. So I think there is no reason that the current assumption is unimpeachable and unchangeable.</p>
<p>The challenge will be carving out a version of Biblical Criticism that doesn&#8217;t undermine our mandate that we keep the Torah but allows for subsequent emendations and additions. Is it possible? Not yet. It will only become a possibility once we as a collective group realize that the Torah need not be 100% from God in order for us to keep it. But once the current assumption is replaced with the new assumption I think we will see Bible Criticism seep into the frum community as an acceptable form of study. As a matter of comparison, Talmudic criticism was once considered taboo and is gaining slow acceptance in some frum circles.</p>
<p>For all the uproar over R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s position, I feel that his is far more tenable than Wright&#8217;s position on this issue. R&#8217; Farber holds that prophets made additions to the original text of the Torah. This is extremely controversial, but at least God is the one doing the writing, albeit through God&#8217;s prophets. Wright&#8217;s version has too much human interference to be taken seriously as a document that requires our attention. His basic approach is that if it&#8217;s meaningful we will do it no matter where it comes from. This is weak and I doubt it would survive more than a couple generations at most.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the assumption about what it takes for people to keep the Torah is far too limiting. Once it expands I think we will see an increase in Bible Criticism that is acceptable in frum circles. I hope we can get there before we lose too many people based on the wrong assumptions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rabbi Louis Jacobs was an orthodox rabbi in the early 20th century. He was orthodox until he wasn&#8217;t. Professor Alan Brill chronicles the demise of Jacobs and how he diverged from prior orthodox positions and adopted liberal positions that were reserved for the non-orthodox.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate for orthodox Judaism that Jacobs and his contributions were lost to orthodox Judaism. I think we would be better off today had Jacobs toed the line and stayed within the bounds of orthodoxy. He was a great thinker and we nearly had the benefit of his thinking in orthodox Judaism.<span id="more-7368"></span></p>
<p>In short, Jacobs accepted elements of Biblical Criticism to the extent that his view could not be reconciled with any version of orthodox Judaism. According to Brill, Jacobs believed that much of the text of the Bible was not dictated to Moses. He believed that the origins of Judaism were not relevant rather the evolved Judaism of the 20th century was key. Eventually he went so far as to say that the Bible was written by humans.<img class="size-full wp-image-7369 alignright" alt="09jacobs_190" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/09jacobs_190.jpg" width="190" height="257" /></p>
<p>This placed him firmly outside the camp of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>But the real tragedy is what Brill says at the end of his post. Before Jacobs, orthodox Judaism had been developing an acceptable version of dealing with Biblical Criticism. Rabbis like Rabbi J.H. Hertz and Rabbi Isidore Epstein had previously acknowledged that while there was a revelation at Sinai, some parts of the Torah either predated Sinai and were including by incorporation or that some edits may have been made after Sinai. Their  views allowed some human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>The view of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein are significant. Both were orthodox rabbis and nevertheless were able to assert that there was a human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>However, Brill asserts that after Jacobs was ousted from orthodox Judaism for his newfound heretical views, the previously acceptable opinions of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were given the pink slip as well. The approach to Biblical Criticism that developed in the wake of the Jacobs fiasco was so rigid that the somewhat flexible views of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>I think this is unfortunate. Orthodox Jews are expected to believe in the most rigid form of Torah M&#8217;Sinai. It is more rigid that the accepted beliefs of great orthodox rabbis from all across the timeline of Jewish history. Is it all because of Jacobs? Maybe. It certainly fits historically.</p>
<p>So while it is a shame that we lost Jacobs, in essence we have also lost Rabbis Hertz and Epstein. This is an even greater tragedy. They were orthodox and now their views are widely considered unorthodox.</p>
<p>But would it not be helpful to 2013 Judaism to allow their opinions back into the fold? I think it would. Absolute Torah M&#8217;Sinai can be a greater challenge than believing in God or in the power of Chazal to create obligation to contemporary orthodox Jews. Perhaps having a more flexible version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai that is consistent with historical orthodox Judaism would be of great use to frum skeptics everywhere.</p>

To be honest, when I read the interview I was unable to comprehend what she was trying to say. Only after a lengthy Facebook conversation and some posts by Gideon Slifkin did I get her approach, sort of.</p>
<p>Her words are very dense and quite cryptic but I think this what she is trying to say.</p>
<p>In her opinion, we have two immovable objects. We have Divine Revelation and the requisite belief that God gave the Torah to us in its complete form and we have Biblical Criticism which in her opinion asserts that the Torah has evolved from multiple authors and multiple eras. Something has to give. For most people, ignorance about one or the other is the turning point. People who know more about Biblical Criticism than TMS are more likely to think that the Torah is not Divine. Those who know more about (the Orthodox Jewish) approach to Torah than Biblical Criticism are more likely to think that Biblical Criticism is just a theory or soft science with more biases than religious approaches to Torah.</p>
<p>I am not here to take sides and apparently neither is Professor Ross.<span id="more-7233"></span></p>
<p>Ross&#8217;s basic idea is that &#8220;revelation&#8221; was not a one time thing. The revelation continues as the world progressed and however the Torah was emended or edited after Sinai was part of revelation. In order to make this sound religious, Professor Ross uses all kinds of fancy kabbalistic &#8220;logic&#8221; to make this approach kosher. In short, God is not bound by time so everything is really happening at once. Revelation can&#8217;t be just a moment in time and God is continually revealed through the evolution of Torah. Apparently there are allusions to this kind of theology in classical sources. Also, the thing that make our tradition unique is only that it is our tradition. I&#8217;m not sure how and why this fits in, but she does say it.</p>
<p>Read the entire interview because the bulk of it is really about what this approach is not as opposed to what this approach actually is. But what is it?</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not Orthodox. That&#8217;s for sure. But as has been pointed out, it&#8217;s not that far off. In terms of how the charedi world sees Mesorah and Daas Torah, the assumption is that God is &#8220;signing off&#8221; on the developments of Orthodox Judaism is part and parcel of how charedi Judaism works. So is it so hard to hear that God functioned the same way with regard to how the text of the Written Law evolved? Granted, the Written Law and Oral Law have different parameters and roles and I am not saying that these two ideas are the same. I am merely pointing out that the two ideas are similar.</p>
<p>Is this idea viable or useful?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. First of all, simple ideas are popular. There is a reason that more nuanced positions are less popular than bombastic theories of everything. People like when things are simple. The fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is simple and not nuanced at all. It&#8217;s also pretty popular. If you want a theory to be popular it needs to be simple. Professor Ross has proposed a very complicated theory that is very difficult to articulate. It&#8217;s not going to gain much traction because of this fatal flaw.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think that an idea like this is not likely to help actual people. People who believe in the fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai don&#8217;t need this. People who reject Torah M&#8217;Sinai are not usually looking for creative way to believe in Torah M&#8217;Sinai. Further, I am not sure that this path will lead people who reject fundamentalist Torah M&#8217;Sinai to mitzvah observance. I think they want to do what God says to do, not what men say to do as a part of God&#8217;s slow revelation.</p>
<p>However, there are a few people in the middle who I am confident that this approach can help. Some people just want some theological basis to be orthodox and this can potentially serve that small group. If we believe in the primacy of keeping Torah and Mitzvos then we should welcome creative ways that are somewhat theologically sound to help more people accomplish this goal.</p>

<p>One of my favorite topics and themes in Judaism is understanding the structure and methodology of the Talmud. I am constantly looking for more sources and studying, adapting and adjusting my understanding of the issues. Until I read the post on Kavvanah I did not know about the introduction to the Talmud written by Rabbi J.H. Hertz. I read it and I loved it.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest you read the entire introduction. It is written beautifully and with such an inspiring view of the Talmud that it becomes required reading.</p>
<p>Some highlights:<span id="more-5051"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Like nearly every one of the rabbis, he earned his bread by manual labour.</em></p>
<p>Speaking about the rabbis of the Talmud, R&#8217; Hertz reminds us that the rabbis of the Talmud worked for a living. They studied when they were able. He wrote this before the standardization of kollel. But it is almost prophetically inspired.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Concerning the exact time at which the Mishnah was committed to writing, diversity of opinion has prevailed among eminent Jewish authorities during the last nine centuries.</em></p>
<p>I never knew this. But apparently, R&#8217; Sherira Gaon and Rashi, among others held that the Mishna was not actually written down until the 8th or 9th century. I would love to see a citation for this. Either way, this is astounding to me. I was always taught that R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi codified AND wrote down the mishna. It seems that these authorities held that the Mishna was codified by R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi and was transmitted orally for a few hundred years before it was published in written form. Clearly, Rambam disagrees. Fascinating.</p>
<p>Here is the best part:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Halachah, as we have seen, means ‘the trodden path’, rule of life, religious guidance. To it belong all laws and regulations that bear upon Jewish conduct. These include the ritual, the civil, criminal, and ethical laws.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Everything else is embraced under the term Haggadah; literally, ‘talk’, ‘that which is narrated’, ‘delivered in a discourse’. This again can he subdivided into various groups. We have dogmatical Haggadah, treating of God’s attributes and providence, creation, revelation, Messianic times, and the Hereafter. The historical Haggadah brings traditions and legends concerning the heroes and events in national or universal history, from Adam to Alexander of Macedon, Titus and Hadrian. It is legend pure and simple. Its aim is not so much to give the facts concerning the righteous and unrighteous makers of history. as the moral that may be pointed from the tales that adorn their honour or dishonour.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>That some of the folklore element in the Haggadah, some of the customs depicted or obiter dicta reported. are repugnant to Western taste need not be denied. ‘The greatest fault to be found with those who wrote down such passages. says Schechter, ‘is that they did not observe the wise rule of Dr Johnson who said to Boswell on a certain occasion, “Let us get serious, for there comes a fool”. And the fools unfortunately did come, in the shape of certain Jewish commentators and Christian controversialists, who took as serious things which were only the expression of a momentary impulse. or represented the opinion of sonic isolated individual, or were meant simply as a piece of humorous by-play, calculated to enliven the interest of a languid audience.’</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In spite of the fact that the Haggadah contains parables of infinite beauty and enshrines sayings of eternal worth, it must be remembered that the Haggadah consists of mere individual utterances that possess no general and binding authority.</em></p>
<p>This is a loaded paragraph and one that today is considered highly controversial. R&#8217; Hertz has the broad shoulders necessary to make such a statement and I admire him greatly for making it. What he is saying is that the Talmud has statements that are binding and many that are not. The difference between the two is whether or not they are halachic. Further, it should not be a surprise to anyone if the rabbis of the Talmud were inaccurate in their non-halachic statements. Some were mistakes, others were made for purposes other than for their truth. R&#8217; Hertz charges those who take these non-serious statements with greater seriousness than they were intended as fools. I wouldn&#8217;t be so harsh. But I agree with the sentiment.</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen if a prominent rabbi wrote this today.</p>
<p>And finally another excellent line in conclusion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>My purpose is merely to give a brief presentation of the Talmud as a book. I shall therefore conclude with the words of I. Abrahams. ‘The Talmud,’ he says, ‘is one of the great books of the world. Rabbinism was a sequel to the Bible; and if, like all sequels, it was unequal to its original, it nevertheless shares its greatness. The works of all Jews up to the modern period were the sequel to this sequel. Through them all may be detected the unifying principle that literature in its truest sense includes life itself; that intellect is the handmaid to conscience; and that the best books are those which best teach men how to live. The maxim, Righteousness delivers from death, applies to books as well as to men. A literature whose consistent theme is Righteousness, is immortal.’</em></p>
<p>Through it all, the Talmud is one of the greatest books ever written. It&#8217;s true, the sequel is at least as good as the original. We follow the Talmud in our lives and the Talmud interprets the Torah. It&#8217;s world certainly seems different to the naked eye than the world of the Bible. Says, R&#8217; Hertz, this is a good thing.</p>
<p>Above all, the Talmud is an attempt at righteousness and aids us all in our attempts towards the same.</p>
