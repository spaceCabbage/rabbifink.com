				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mount_sinai_2_2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7095 alignleft" alt="mount_sinai_2_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mount_sinai_2_2.jpg" width="312" height="258" /></a>Shavuos is upon us. In our times, the holiday is celebrated as the time we received the Holy Torah at Mount Sinai. The day is a day of Torah. Many have the custom to learn through the night in anticipation of the morning which we commemorate the revelation at Sinai. Extended Torah study is an excellent way to celebrate Shavuos.</p>
<p>To me, the most poignant element of <em>ma&#8217;amad Har Sinai</em> comes before the revelation. The Torah tells us that the Jewish people camped around the mountain. The world used to describe this encampment is the word <em>va&#8217;yichan</em>. We would expect that the word would be <em>va&#8217;yichanu</em>, in the plural tense. Instead we get<em> va&#8217;yichan</em>, in the singular tense. Rashi quotes the famous Midrashic interpretation that the Jewish people were united as one in their preparation for receiving the Torah. Since the people were &#8220;one&#8221; the Torah uses a singular tense to describe their encampment.</p>
<p>The message is loud and clear. We are being told that there can be no <em>matan Torah</em> without unity.<span id="more-7094"></span></p>
<p>Thus, every year we hope to renew our covenant with God and Torah on Shavuos, but first we must fulfill the prerequisite of unity to have a chance at accepting the Torah.</p>
<p>In addition to our unity, it seems there was a unity of nature and supernature at the same time. <em>Chazal</em> tell us that the birds stopped chirping, the animals were quiet, even the Angels were silent. The seas were calm, people all over the word held their tongues. The entire world was waiting in absolute unity for God to share the Torah with the world.</p>
<p>To me, universal silence represents each person, each being, each element of nature listening as it were, to the word of God. When we are talking, when we are active, when we are not silent, we are unable to hear anything from the outside. In order to listen, in order to hear, we need to be silent.</p>
<p>In order to achieve true unity and to accept the Torah we need to be silent. We need to hear what is being said. We need to open our eyes and open our hearts to connect with one another and become one.</p>
<p>Unity means different things to different people. Some people think it means that we all need to agree. Some people think it means tolerance of others and acceptance of those who are within a certain accepted boundary. Some people think it must include everyone, even those you believe are truly evil or wrong.</p>
<p>To me, unity means listening to everyone. It means giving everyone an opportunity to be heard, even our opponents. Unity means trying to find common ground and focus on the things we can agree upon. It means choosing our battles wisely so that we can create positive feelings toward one another.</p>
<p>We have been through a lot over the last few weeks and months as a nation. Sometimes we get contentious toward one another. Often our disagreements are passionate and can get heated. We are all trying to do what is right.</p>
<p>As we approach Shavuos it is incumbent upon us to emulate our forefathers and come together as one in preparation of renewing our relationship to God and the Torah. We also must practice effective silence. We need to listen to one another. We need to hear each other. We need to create opportunities for dialogue and conversation.</p>
<p>We all want to merit the crown of Torah. Let us take these lessons and make them a part of our collective lives. Let us find the strength of unity and silence and we will find a Torah that connects us all to one another and to the Almighty.</p>
<p>Happy Shavuos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Yes. It is true. The Moment of Silence in Public Schools in Illinois is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality" target="_blank">unconstitutional</a>. Let&#8217;s take a moment of silence to remember the moment of silence.</p>
<p>A total of 18 states have similar statutes in their legislation giving students a moment of silence or prayer during school time.</p>
<p>In 1969 the Illinois legislature passed the following act:</p>
<p><span id="more-234"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="DocumentBody">Illinois Complied Statutes, Chapter 105 Act 20, ยง 1. In each public school classroom the teacher in charge shall observe a brief period of silence with the participation of all the pupils therein assembled at the opening of every school day. This period shall not be conducted as a religious exercise but shall be an opportunity for silent prayer or for silent reflection on the anticipated activities of the day.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="DocumentBody"><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090122/ap_on_re_us/moment_of_silence" target="_blank">Today, a federal judge ruled that this act is in violation of the constitutional line which separates church and state. </a></span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">The suit was filed by &#8220;outspoken atheist&#8221; <a href="http://www.robsherman.com/" target="_blank">Rob Sherman</a>. His claim is that the teachers in the younger grades were teaching the students to pray. In my opinion the teachers were in violation of a very good statute. The statute is very clear about its intentions. Give students a moment to reflect on their day and some may use this for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer" target="_blank">prayer</a> and some may choose not to pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">I think we all need a moment to reflect and meditate on our day. In fact psychologists claim that <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20030424-000003.html" target="_blank">meditation makes you calmer and happier</a>. Jewish prayer is supposed to be part prayer and part meditation. Meaning that we use prayer as a time to focus and center in addition to thanking and recognizing God.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">If the statute is being followed it is clearly beneficial. I wonder why the plaintiff did not attempt to require strict adherence to this great statute and instead decided to lash out against the idea completely and have the statute removed? Wouldn&#8217;t that be better? If the teachers followed the statute it would okay &#8211; right?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">Or maybe the &#8220;outspoken atheist&#8221; does not want anybody to meditate and reflect? Maybe that is too dangerous? Maybe if you meditate or reflect you are one step closer to prayer, which is one step closer to belief in God (&#8220;God forbid&#8221;)?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="DocumentBody">Next time there is a moment of silence at a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPSZ2Mu80aM" target="_blank">concert</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQVLdJRu3YI" target="_blank">ball game</a> or at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB6HvJhXdYg" target="_blank">White House</a> I expect the &#8220;<a href="http://www.robsherman.com/" target="_blank">outspoken atheist</a>&#8221; to protest.<br />
</span></p>
