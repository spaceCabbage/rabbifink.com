				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that it is unconstitutional for a state to ban same sex marriage. The issue still divides America, though the latest Pew numbers say 54% of Americans are in favor of gay marriage and only 36% oppose.</p>
<p>In the Orthodox Jewish community, the matter is far less polarizing. I could not find any actual numbers, but I think most people are correct in assuming that the vast majority of Orthodox Jews oppose same sex marriage for themselves and for America. All the mainstream Orthodox Jewish umbrella organizations have issued statements over the past few years reiterating this opposition. Some Orthodox Jews are ambivalent on the issue, and a small minority are in favor of gay marriage.</p>
<p>I celebrate the Supreme Court decision.<span id="more-9339"></span></p>
<p>A lot of people are confused how an Orthodox rabbi who follows the Torah and its laws could celebrate the legalization of gay marriage.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/28/i-believe-in-torah-halacha-and-equality/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1-si/" rel="attachment wp-att-9340"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9340" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si_.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I have been mocked, berated, insulted, defrocked, and even ousted from Orthodoxy for supporting marriage equality. I’ve been asked, respectfully and less respectfully, how I reconcile my  belief in marriage equality and my religious beliefs. This is my official response.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a civil rights issue. Gay people exist. They are your neighbors and co-workers. They might be your friends and family as well. It’s hard to be gay in America. There’s trauma involved. Gay people fall in love. They want to live together as a married couple. They want to get married for the same reasons everyone else wants to get married. Restricting consenting adults from a loving, committed marriage is a form of discrimination. I believe that discrimination is wrong. I believe that citizens of free countries should not feel oppressed. I believe that more freedom for more people is a good thing for everyone, including Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>Of course, I am concerned about the implications of the ruling. I am concerned about clergy with religious objections to officiating a gay marriage, but those personal concerns cannot trump the more basic civil rights of others, especially people who typically suffer persecution and discrimination.</p>
<p>I am not concerned about slippery slopes or men marrying dogs and bikes and children. Marriage requires consent. Dogs, bikes, and children cannot consent.</p>
<p>I am not concerned that America is becoming a Godless state with no morals. If you want equal rights and protection under the law, everyone else must benefit, too. It is wrong to suggest that equality applies unevenly. Orwell said it best in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451526341/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0451526341&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=VHSNVVTJV2A2QCBZ">Animal Farm</a>, <em>&#8220;All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&#8221;</em> It is moral to be fair to others, even if those others are people who violate your religious beliefs. There are competing morals in this case, and America is choosing the more compassionate and the more just of the moral options.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a good thing. I celebrate marriage equality. I am also an Orthodox Jew and I would not perform a religious wedding ceremony that is not consistent with my understanding of Jewish law, including a gay marriage. Those two statements are not contradictory.</p>
<p>There is a long list of things that I think are very important to Orthodox Judaism. Banning gay marriage is near the bottom of the list. Kindness, compassion, and fairness are near the top of the list.</p>
<p>I understand that many Orthodox Jews have visceral fears about this gay marriage because of Jewish law. I hope we can get past those fears and move forward toward understanding and love.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/call_of_duty_black_ops2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3267" title="call_of_duty_black_ops2" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/call_of_duty_black_ops2-300x187.jpg?resize=300%2C187" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Violence in video games is a subject that has become a hot topic. Some feel there should be more regulation of violence in video games. Some have called for banning violent games for children. In California a board of censors has been proposed and the Supreme Court of the United States recently heard arguments for and against creating a censorship bureau.</p>
<p>The case turns of whether video games are protected under the 1st Amendment and whether that protection should be suspended in favor of protecting children from violent video content.</p>
<p>The ruling will be an important ruling for an industry that is larger than the Television and Movie industries in America.</p>
<p>One of the more violent game series released a new installment today. Call of Duty: Black Ops<span id="more-3266"></span> puts the player in the middle of a cold-war era war. The player controls machine guns, tanks and rocket launchers in their quest to kill and destroy the enemy. It is highly anticipated and is supposed to be the &#8220;next great game&#8221;.</p>
<p>Personally, I would rather not see the government censor for the sake of children. Parents are supposed to censor for their children and expecting the government to babysit our children is lazy, irresponsible and far more dangerous than the violence contained within the video games. Parents like to pass the buck. It&#8217;s easy to tell a child &#8220;Sorry, the law makes it illegal to buy that game for you&#8221;. It&#8217;s not so easy to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that game is suitable for someone your age&#8221;. We always like to blame someone else for depriving children&#8230;</p>
<p>The biggest difference between violence in video games and tv / movies is that the violence in a game is controlled by the player. In the player&#8217;s mind, he or she is committing the act of violence. In a show or movie, the viewer is not a participant in the violence, they are a spectator. Games are great because of their &#8220;immersiveness&#8221; and that is also what some feel makes them more dangerous than seeing violence on tv or in a movie.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops does not shy away from the allure of the immersive nature of the game. In fact they glorify it with their television commercial for the game. The ad features regular folks in their regular clothing, answering their cell phones while firing their weapons in a war scene. The ad has people of all races, genders and levels of fame &#8211; it includes Kobe Bryant and Jimmy Kimmel as well. The whole point of the ad is that when we play a game we feel like we are in the game.</p>
<p>In my opinion. the ad is ingenious. It really captures the &#8220;everyman&#8221; playing the game and becoming part of the game. However, the ad is not without controversy. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/11/call-of-dutys-twisted-advertising-campaign/66293/" target="_blank">Some say</a> it makes the game &#8220;too real&#8221; and it is disturbing to consider the effects of a &#8220;real&#8221; war. A game can look almost real, but never will it look really real, as it does in the ad.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t bother me. The ad is great marketing for a controversial product that adults can choose if they would like to purchase. There&#8217;s no sense avoiding the thing that makes these games fun&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is the ad. What do you think?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Supreme-Court1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2269" title="Supreme-Court" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Supreme-Court.jpg?resize=270%2C203" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A few weeks ago my brother-in-law asked me which branch of government I thought was the most powerful. I immediately answered, &#8220;Legislative&#8221;. He was surprised. As a fellow law student we read case after case where the Supreme Court overturned laws that it felt were unconstitutional. While that is true, it requires Herculean effort for the Supreme Court to overturn a law. The legislature can just write a new law whenever they want. That gives them almost all the power.</p>
<p>It has long been my feeling that legislatures are the best place to effect change in laws. Citizens can petition their law makers to make laws that they want and of they don&#8217;t make law that their constituents like, they can vote someone who will into office. Is this a slow process? Sure. But the Supreme Court process is even slower and the chance that your case will be heard is slim.</p>
<p>There is a second issue when the Judicial Branch speaks from &#8220;on-high&#8221; and mandates a change in law.<span id="more-2267"></span> This was illustrated to me by my supervising research attorney at the California Court of Appeals. He agreed with me that the Legislative Branch is most powerful. He added that sometimes a Supreme Court opinion can have the reverse effect that it intends. For example, in Roe v. Wade, the court held that laws banning / highly regulating abortion in the first trimester were unconstitutional. The reaction from the strident voice of opposition was not the acquiesce and lay low. In fact, it had the opposite affect. Millions and millions of dollars were poured into &#8220;overturning Roe&#8221;. This went on for decades. Interest groups spent all their energy trying to get Roe reversed. But if Roe had not sued in the Supreme Court or if the Supreme Court had denied to see hear Roe, it is very likely that the legislatures would have come around to see the law the way the Supreme Court saw it. In other words, if all the money and time and energy of the Supreme Court case had been spent on activism and PR in favor of looser abortion restrictions, it would have happened organically. And the reaction would not have been so severe.</p>
<p>Sometimes the people are not ready for the ruling of the Supreme Court. Sometime they need time to adjust their old views and in time, they will get it right. This is one of the main reasons there has been weak attempts to take the issue of same sex marriage to the Supreme Court. Even if the Supreme Court rules in their favor, a huge backlash is predicted. This would wind up having the opposite of the intended effect. Time, energy and money would be spent on &#8220;overturning&#8221; the decision. It is wiser to just wait until the people are willing to give them the rights they desire. (Of course this assumes this is bound to happen. As I wrote a while back in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/03/human-beings-are-social-beings/">Human Beings Are Social Beings</a>, more and more people know gay individuals and couples, it is going to be harder and harder to look them in the eye and say &#8220;no rights for you&#8221;. So I am pretty sure it will probably happen eventually.)</p>
<p>Another perfect example of change having the opposite of its desired effect is in the area of Health Care Reform. President Obama and almost all the Democrats want to regulate Health Care. They promise that rates will drop, insurance companies will be forced to be fairer and less discriminatory and everything will be wonderful. As I am self-insured, the new laws may actually help me, but probably not before I get a job with medical benefits.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the proposed bill is having the OPPOSITE effect. My health care premiums went up by 30% a couple months ago. My coverage is the same. My plan is the same. I just pay way more. The NY Times even had a write-up on MY insurance company. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/opinion/19fri1.html?scp=1&amp;sq=anthem%20blue%20cross&amp;st=cse">Editorial &#8211; The Lesson of California&#8217;s Anthem Blue Cross on Health &#8230;</a>) Sometimes, when change is forced down people&#8217;s throats, the effect is the opposite of what is intended. HCR may be wonderful, but in the meantime, it is squeezing millions of self-insured folks as they wait&#8230;</p>
<p>So how does change happen? It is best for it to happen organically. It is best for things to evolve, change slowly without huge monumental changes from &#8220;on-high&#8221;.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a story I read once:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The sun and the wind were having a contest to see you could get the man to remove his coat. The wind blew hard and the man clutched his coat tighter. The wind blew even harder and the man redoubled his efforts to hold his coat. The sun shone bright and the man got warm and took his coat off on his own.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>(Where are we going with this? You&#8217;ll see soon.)</p>

I began my talk by complimenting my parents and expressing my desire to emulate their parenting in the raising of my own children. One such example occurred today.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://lls.edu" target="_blank">Law School</a> we are reading some of the most well-known Supreme Court Cases. A few weeks ago we read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade" target="_blank">Roe v. Wade</a> (banning 1st term abortion is unconstitutional) and the even more important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey" target="_blank">Casey v. Planned Parenthood</a> (upheld Roe) cases. Last week we read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson" target="_blank">Plessy v. Ferguson</a> (after Civil War, Separate but Equal schools were ruled constitutional).</p>
<p>This week we are reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education" target="_blank">Brown v. Board of Education</a>. This case overruled Plessy and made Separate but Equal unconstitutional in <strong><em>Public Schools</em></strong>.<span id="more-2235"></span> Brown v. Board of Education paved the way for Civil Rights activists like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to fight for equal rights for all people in all areas of life, beyond public education.</p>
<p>As I was reading the case I remembered a very influential &#8220;Parenting&#8221; episode from my youth. Growing up, we did not watch many movies. I saw a few movies on TV, like E.T. and The Wizard of Oz but that was about it. But I vividly remember my father strongly encouraging me to watch one particular movie with him when I was twelve years old.</p>
<p>That movie was a PBS special called The American Experience: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108139/fullcredits#cast" target="_blank">Simple Justice</a>. It beautifully told the story of Thurgood Marshall as he learned the law and was groomed into the perfect counsel for the Supreme Court cases to reverse Plessy. The climax of the movie is the Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education and the Court&#8217;s ruling that Separate but Equal was not constitutional.</p>
<p>My father wanted me to see it and I recall a strong desire to study the law and become a lawyer after watching it. My preferred career path took some detours along the way, but several years later my interest in the law returned in earnest.</p>
<p>Today, our professor at Loyola Law School, <a href="http://www.lls.edu/academics/faculty/strauss.html">Marcy Strauss</a>, showed the very same movie to the class in lieu of a more traditional lecture and Socratic discussion. All the memories I had as a youngster were re-energized and I was quite moved by the movie, again.</p>
<p>Brown v. Board of Education raises some very important issues that are still very relevant to modern discourse. In just 56 years, much has changed in the landscape of race relations in the USA. Some things are still the same, or at the very least follow the same bigoted roots. There are other minorities seeking equal rights as well. Sometimes, we can go overboard in our sensitivities as I will write about tomorrow. And sometimes, one part of the world can be slow to see that Separate cannot be Equal, as I will write about the next day.</p>
<p>This movie is a must see. My father was very wise to encourage me to see it and I will always remember watching it together with him. (Thank you.)</p>
<p>The part of the movie that moved me most when I was a youngster stuck with me until today. I was talking with some friends at school and I mentioned that while reading Brown v. Board of Education I recalled a scene from this very movie. I had no idea that we were going to be watching the movie in class. I recounted the scene as best as my 12 year old brain could understand it and it was just as I remembered it when I saw it tonight.</p>
<p>The scene is of a study that was being conducted to analyze the way segregated black children felt about themselves. The tester would ask questions of the children using dolls, one black and one white. The results of the test showed conclusively that black children felt inferior. The dramatization of the test was very powerful and I found it on youtube so that you can see it for yourself below.</p>
