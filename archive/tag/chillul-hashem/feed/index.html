				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Religious-Symbols-II1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5190" title="Religious-Symbols-II1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Religious-Symbols-II1-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="300" /></a>Every religion has abhorrent beliefs. An abhorrent belief is a part of one&#8217;s religion that would offend an outsider. All religions have these beliefs. Whether they concern non-members of the religion, women, slavery, genocide or the afterlife, many religious beliefs are upsetting to members of other religions.</p>
<p>Historically, these beliefs were kept within the bounds of the religious group and no one was the wiser. By and large, people didn&#8217;t have access to religious texts and codes of other religions. There was little interaction between people of various religions. Abhorrent beliefs were safe.</p>
<p>But things have changed. The international community has become like a small village. We all know each other&#8217;s business. Television and the Internet have made us all virtual neighbors. Enemies used to be neighbors or neighboring territories. Now enemies can be anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Last week, one abhorrent belief of Mormonism was exposed (again).<span id="more-5188"></span> I don&#8217;t mean to pick on Mormonism, we will get to Judaism soon. And while on the topic of Mormons, let&#8217;s not forget the comment made by a presidential candidate aide dismissing all Mormons as non-Christians. Anyway, the Church of Latter Day Saints has a practice of <a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;sourceId=1ec52f2324d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____" target="_blank">baptizing all sorts of people who are dead</a>. They don&#8217;t deny it. In fact you can read several fascinating article on the LDS website about the practice. They base it on sources in the Old and New <em>(sic)</em> Testament and in their eyes it is a beautiful honor to the deceased. When it was discovered (again) that they were posthumously baptizing Holocaust victims, outrage ensued. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/elie-wiesel-calls-on-mitt-romney-to-make-mormon-church-stop-proxy-baptisms-of-jews/2012/02/14/gIQAZK6bER_story.html" target="_blank">Elie Wiesel and the Wiesenthal Center demanded that they stop and that they apologize.</a> Somehow Mitt Romney was being asked to apologize as well.</p>
<p>I found myself conflicted. On one hand I have always had a distaste for baptism for the dead. It is the reason I won&#8217;t use a site like Ancestry.com which is owned by the Mormon Church and the data is mined for baptism purposes. I find the practice abhorrent. It really is a little twisted to think about baptizing people who were killed simply because they were Jews! On the other hand I also find it silly and meaningless. Why should it bother me if they say some magic words that in my opinion accomplish absolutely nothing? It&#8217;s a tough call. It&#8217;s certainly not as bad as Elie Wiesel thinks.</p>
<p>Either way, the issue is really what should the Mormon Church do about its abhorrent belief that they should baptize dead non-Mormons? They think they are doing a good and moral act. To outsiders it is offensive. What to do?</p>
<p>Closer to home, Judaism has its fair share of abhorrent beliefs. Most of them no longer apply. Most of them have either been reinterpreted or require circumstances that are not currently at play. Some people want to accelerate those circumstances and create the environment that would allow and require those abhorrent beliefs be put into practice.</p>
<p>Sometimes religious people have abhorrent beliefs or ideas that are not essential to their religion. They may think that these are religious rules, but they are not. These are social conventions that are more likely the result of years of persecution, insularity, and fear as opposed to drawn from religious texts. But the lines are rarely so clear. More recent texts are likely to mix the two and then provide sources for new abhorrent beliefs that are not intrinsic to the religion.</p>
<p>What does the orthodox Jew do about these beliefs?</p>
<p>There are two approaches that I know. The first is based on a famous thought experiment called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma" target="_blank">Euthyphro Dilemma</a>. In short, the idea is that if God commands something it is intrinsically moral. Thus, the social conventions that may make a belief seem abhorrent are really false and true morality only exists in God&#8217;s commandments. This has appeal but it is a tough pill to swallow. Are we really comfortable with Divinely commanded genocide? I&#8217;d rather not have to make that choice. It also seems incongruous that God would create humans who would develop over time into beings whose sense of morality is at odds with God&#8217;s word.</p>
<p>The second approach is to interpret abhorrent beliefs in a way that makes them less abhorrent. This doesn&#8217;t always work, and could rankle the feathers of the more traditionalist among us, but when it works, it works well. For example, there is a commandment to hate (and kill) Amalek. This seems at odds with human perception of fairness and compassion. Over on Hirhurim, R&#8217; Norman Lamm is quoted and I direct your attention there (<a href="http://torahmusings.com/2012/02/when-hatred-is-a-mitzvah/" target="_blank">Hirhurim</a>) as his answer is not relevant to this discussion.</p>
<p>Which all leads to the most fascinating question of all: When these abhorrent beliefs are exposed or shared with outsiders and they make us look bad or old-fashioned, or immoral, or bigoted in the eyes of those outsiders is that a desecration of God&#8217;s Name?</p>
<p>Maimonides codifies several examples of kiddush and chillul Hashem in Chapter 5 of Yesodei HaTorah. None of them really concern the opinions of outsiders about our beliefs. They all concern how we act. There are times we must die for the sake of God&#8217;s commandments and there are other instances where our status as Jews or scholars requires us to act in a refined manner. Failure to do so is a chillul Hashem. The principle of chillul Hashem as it relates to how others think of our beliefs does not enter the conversation.</p>
<p>I think we can safely say that exposing what the Torah says cannot be considered a chillul Hashem.</p>
<p>However, this does not account for social conventions, prejudices, and anti-social ideas that emanate from insularity or superstition that are confused with religious fervor or beliefs. I think it is fair to say that exposing a non-essential abhorrent belief might be a chillul Hashem. That is unfortunately the inevitable result of the new global community. So what is the appropriate response when these secrets are revealed (as they were in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/20/unorthodox-book-review-and-analysis/">Unorthodox</a>)?</p>
<p>The solution is not to cry chillul Hashem and force the issue back into the dark hole from where it came. The solution is to eradicate non-essential abhorrent beliefs. There is little we can do about our essential beliefs that don&#8217;t jive with modern sensibilities. We have to hope that others recognize that every religion and even many non-religions have abhorrent beliefs and so long as they don&#8217;t cause any harm, they can be ignored. Much in the same way as I can ignore baptism of the dead. But if there are non-essential abhorrent beliefs in our community that can be changed or removed, I think it is wise and prudent to do all that we can to eliminate these items from our community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/logo.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4898" title="logo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/logo-300x73.png" alt="" width="300" height="73" /></a>Several online news publications reported on the YU Beacon controversy from this past week. The Beacon is a student newspaper at Yeshiva University. It is a student voice for Yeshiva College and Stern College.</p>
<p>The controversy arose from a particular article that was authored anonymously. I will not get into the details of the content of the article. Generally, it was about a young woman studying at Stern who lapsed in her observance in a hotel room with a fellow observant Jewish male. The article&#8217;s entire point was that while it may have been exhilarating, it was shameful and she was full of regret.</p>
<p>An objective reading of the article would lead to several conclusions.<span id="more-4897"></span></p>
<p>1) There is a tension in the YU community regarding intimacy before marriage.<br />
2) There are some people who breach the barriers of halacha and are intimate before marriage.<br />
3) The culture of YU does not &#8220;accept&#8221; this as normative behavior and it is considered shameful.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t find any of these conclusions to be super offensive. I don&#8217;t think they place Jews in a poor light. I don&#8217;t think they place Modern Orthodox Jews in particular in a bad light either.</p>
<p>What happened next complicated things.</p>
<p>Apparently, MANY students complained that this article was offensive. It was pulled temporarily. After a meeting between the student council, The Beacon editors and some YU administrators, the article was reposted with a disclaimer and The Beacon is now independent of YU.</p>
<p>The next level of analysis that always follows instances such as these is &#8211; Was this a kiddush Hashem or a Chillul Hashem?</p>
<p>The answer is both. And neither. Every part of the story has nuances that can be interpreted as positive and negative. Which means, that like most things controversial, it cannot be decided by one metric. I don&#8217;t use the words Kiddush and Chillul Hashem willy nilly, instead I will just use the words positive and negative. What follows is my personal analysis.</p>
<p><em>DISCLAIMERs: I am not a YU alum. I have never even been to the Yeshiva part of the University. I have been the High School twice and to the Seforim sale once. Also, I have written for The Beacon.</em></p>
<p>The article was titillating. It was in a YU publication. I think that may have been negative. A school newspaper should reflect the student body. Much of the student body does not want erotica in their newspaper. The article could have been interpreted as erotica.</p>
<p>But the message was positive. I think that is clear. The message is that we all struggle. We all feel guilty when we fail. But most of all, we all try to pick ourselves up and stay true to the values in our community based on Torah.</p>
<p>Taking down the article in response to outrage was also positive. A student newspaper should reflect the mores and mentality of the student body. When it fails to do so, it should reconsider publishing the offending material. In this case, the outrage was so severe that it warranted removal.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would have been more prudent, mature and wise not get so worked up over the article. But college students can be very headstrong. Their minds were made. I think the outrage was a negative.</p>
<p>But the end game was completely dissatisfying. The Beacon dug in its heels standing up for some moral principle and refused to back down in the face of bullies. The student council did not back down either. They forced the Beacon&#8217;s hand. Both sides were stubborn and both sides reflected negatively.</p>
<p>Where is the publicity over this? On which point is the media focusing? That is the key question. If it is simply noting the stubbornness of two student organizations then that is clearly a negative portrayal. But if the media&#8217;s focus is on the more mature and positive elements of this story, I think we can say that we are neutral at worst and positive at best. In that case, perhaps there was a Kiddush Hashem here. Perhaps.</p>
<p>As for me, I wouldn&#8217;t have published the article. I also would not have complained if the article were published.</p>
<p>A note on censorship and freedom of the press: In an environment that mixes secular and religious values as YU claims to do, sometimes one of those value systems must trump the other. If the religious value system says that publication is not wise, then you can can cry freedom of the press and marketplace of ideas as much as you want, but in the end, sometimes religion wins out. Sometimes, freedom of speech loses to restrictions of religion. I agree that a conversation about the content of the article is a good thing. I don&#8217;t know that the manner in which this article was executed was perfect nor do I think the negativity towards it was perfect either.</p>
<p>I do hope that the article will serve its purpose. I hope that it will promote discussion and discourse on this very important issue and that after all is said and done we will all emerge wiser, more devout and committed to our religious values.</p>

<p>This LA Times article actually encompasses the points I made <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/23/in-madoff-scandal-jews-feel-an-acute-betrayal-nytimescom/" target="_blank">yesterday in my post</a> about a similar NY Times article.</p>
<p>Except there are still some Jewish elitists who &#8220;disown&#8221; Madoff (the first &#8220;Rabbis&#8221; mentioned in the article&#8221;). Rabbi Adlerstein and Harriet Rossetto echoed my sentiments of learning from the incident and Madoff&#8217;s opportunity for Tshuva.</p>
<p>Rossetto even goes so far to say that maybe Madoff is the messenger teaching us to redefine our values. That is a good approach. That is a healthy approach.</p>
<p>Divorcing ourselves from Madoff by saying &#8220;Madoff does not represent the Jewish people, not even remotely&#8221; is useless and inaccurate. Firstly, no one represents the Jewish people, we each represent ourselves. Secondly, that kind of disownment is not our place as humans and fellow Jews. He is still a Jew and yes he made mistakes but haven&#8217;t we all?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/24/us/24jews.html?_r=1&amp;hp">In Madoff Scandal, Jews Feel an Acute Betrayal &#8211; NYTimes.com</a></p>
<p>This NY Times article raises some interesting issues. Firstly, does Madoff reflect on &#8220;Jews&#8221; &#8211; are we all judged as a nation / religion by the actions of individuals? Is it anti-semitism when non-Jews express displeasure with the actions of Jews who act like idiots? Is there really no teshuva for Madoff? the last &#8220;rabbi&#8221; quoted seems to thing the Madoff is doomed to hell with no chance for redemption. Last I checked teshuva was always an option.</p>
<p>Besides all those questions what really irked me about this article was the self-righteousness of these non-observant Jews looking down from their pedestal of morality on Madoff. He is not excommunicated from the Jewish people because he is a thief! He is a Jewish thief and he is still our brother. He needs his people now more than ever to be sympathetic to his dire situation. He is not excused but we are not allowed to judge him either. Everyone does things that are wrong, everyone fails a moral challenge along the way. We are no different from Madoff. His sins do have grander repercussions and resonate more strongly throughout the world but at the end of the day he is just another person who messed up.</p>
<p>It is useless to paint him as a non-Jewish Jew because of his mistakes. As Jews we believe that mistakes are inevitable, it is how we dael with those mistakes that defines us. Not a bunch of &#8220;Rabbis&#8221; telling the NY Times that Madoff isn&#8217;t really Jewish because he is a crook!</p>
