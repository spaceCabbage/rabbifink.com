With an emphasis on furious. Noted author and trailblazer Yitta Halberstam wrote what might be the most universally offensive article about shidduchim that the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Ms. Halberstam is best known for co-authoring the &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1598698419/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1598698419" target="_blank">Small Miracles</a>&#8221; series of books. She was also featured in an article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/04/nyregion/working-world-grows-for-orthodox-women-new-fields-and-strict-judaism-coexist.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm" target="_blank">NY Times</a> about orthodox Jewish women breaking gender boundaries (something <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/20/unorthodox-book-review-and-analysis/" target="_blank">Deborah Feldman</a> could have benefited from). This weekend, however, she set off a &#8220;small firestorm&#8221; and pushed gender equality backward by a couple generations.</p>
<p>The Jewish Press published an article penned by Ms. Halberstam. If you have not yet read the article, please click here and read <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/family/purim-and-the-tyranny-of-beauty-a-plea-to-mothers-of-girls-in-shidduchim/2012/03/19/0/" target="_blank">Purim and the Tyranny of Beauty</a>, then come back here.</p>
<p><em>Caveat: It is possible that this article is satire. A Purim joke. If it is, then the joke is on me and all the people who missed the joke. If anyone knows with certainty that this article is or is not satire please let us all in on the joke. </em><em>Thanks. Either way, this is a superb example of something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poes_law" target="_blank">Poe&#8217;s Law</a>. Even if it is satire, the article raises real issues that are analyzed in this post.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-5291"></span></p>
<p>The article is so bad that I am not even going to attempt to address everything in there. For the sake of brevity, just assume that whatever raised your eyebrows and blood pressure, did the same to thousands of others. There are a few areas of discussion that I think are particularly important to cover.</p>
<p>First, the details. Let&#8217;s just get straight to it. Ms. Halberstam is actually suggesting that young women undergo elective surgery to fix their bodies. Yes. If a girl is not married in her early 20&#8217;s it&#8217;s probably because her nose is too big. Does it get any more superficial than that? It does not.</p>
<p>Let me count the ways that this is offensive and just plain wrong. Isn&#8217;t one of the points of dating for marriage via the shidduch system to avoid the superficiality of dating purely based on looks? Where do these guys come off being so picky about looks? Why are we playing into this stupidity? Don&#8217;t the Tzitz Eliezer and R&#8217; Shlomo Zalman prohibit elective surgery purely for the sake of beauty? (Yes, I know there are others who permit it. But since when is Ms. Halberstam qualified to decide this matter of dispute between the poskim?!) Does Ms. Halberstam know that some people are happy with their looks and don&#8217;t think they should cow to social pressure to look a certain (superficial) way? I mean, seriously, say it out loud: &#8220;An orthodox Jewish woman is advocating plastic surgery to improve normal girls&#8217; appearances&#8221;. Does this sound right to you?</p>
<p>Another detail. The girls who came to this meeting are an excellent case study. As an aside, Ms. Halberstam embarrasses them. She calls many of them plain-looking. This is not very nice. And it&#8217;s also very superficial. The whole point of meeting people in person is to get to know them and not make snap judgments based on their appearance. Ms. Halberstam fails at this. Miserably.</p>
<p>Then there are the girls. Why, in fact, didn&#8217;t they wear make-up? I venture to guess it is because of their Bais Yaakov education. In that world, cosmetics are often portrayed as the Yetzer Hara. They are to be avoided at all costs. The ones who do wear a little make-up are the &#8220;modern&#8221; girls. So is it any wonder that they don&#8217;t just transform from asexual teens to young women in touch with their femininity? Hardly. A similar problem, that is far more serious, occurs after marriage. It is very difficult for the &#8220;good girls&#8221; to adjust from complete insularity from sexuality to a healthy marriage. I bet that most of the girls at the meeting didn&#8217;t want the prospective mothers in law to think they were &#8220;loose&#8221; by charedi standards. I think if the girls were given more leeway in high school and &#8220;looking good&#8221; was not the work of the devil, there might be less reluctance to wearing make-up at a meeting of women.</p>
<p>The most important discussion about this article is the big picture. The current yeshivish shidduch system is a hybrid system. It is a combination of the almost arranged marriages of the most insular communities of the past and the common dating system of the West. In the hybrid system the parents vet potential mates, most of whom they do not know, and then the young adults go on a sufficient number of dates and if all goes well they get engaged.</p>
<p>There are advantages to this system. It avoids a lot of heartache and also the time spent trying to meet appropriate people. I used to think the system was the best possible system. And when it works, it just might be. But we are now seeing what happens when it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>What is happening now is best compared to &#8220;Crony Capitalism&#8221;. There are &#8220;haves&#8221; who get tons of girls recommended to them and there are &#8220;have nots&#8221; who sit around praying for a call. The &#8220;haves&#8221; get their choice of hundreds of prospective girls who stay the same age no matter how old he gets. The &#8220;have nots&#8221; try to find a match from the reject pile. Not to mention the levels of protexia and shmearing required to get a girl&#8217;s name into the hands of a sought after guy.</p>
<p>The girls are left with no leverage. They cannot look for a guy. The system requires that the guy choose the girl. And by guy, I mean the guy&#8217;s mother. There is almost never a list of guys waiting for a &#8220;yes&#8221; from a girl.</p>
<p>This is not a minor issue. Any system where the &#8220;haves&#8221; are spoiled by their riches will become corrupt. In this case, the corruption is in the narcissism of the boys (really their mothers). They become obsessed with getting the perfect match because they can. This obsession leads to lists, résumés, and many of the problems we are facing today.</p>
<p>Another issue is the attempt to adopt the model of almost arranged marriages. I am suspicious that when this was done in the shtetl, the parents knew the prospective match. They knew each other from around town. They knew their children well and they knew the other young men and women as well. In this kind of environment parental input is not only valid, it can be extremely useful.</p>
<p>But in our world, where young men study in yeshiva and young women study in seminary (and usually change a lot of their ideas in that year) and potential matches are made from across the globe, parental input no longer means what it used to mean. It is even possible, or likely, that parental input could be harmful. They may not know their children as well as they think they do. And that&#8217;s okay. But when the decision maker for whom to date is not on the same page as the decision maker for whom to marry, the results can be uneven or worse, catastrophic. Further, parents love their children. A lot. They will take the time to vet hundreds of potential mates to a degree that no one would dream of doing for their self. Parents are too dedicated. In this case I think it turns into a flaw.</p>
<p>I think, a limited parental involvement is wise, but parent overlords are becoming a bigger problem. But I think that is also a <em>symptom</em> of a larger problem. Many orthodox young couples are supported by their parents and in-laws. Since the parents have such a stake in the outcome, they are given a larger role. Perhaps if marriage was something that came after financial independence, parents would have a lesser role. And I think that would be a good thing.</p>
<p>You might ask how in the world young men and women will get married if their mommies are not taking care of all the work. There are two answers. First, young men will date more willingly without all the superficial vetting. They don&#8217;t care about all that stuff nearly as much as their parents. So the logjam will loosen. Dates will happen more freely. Idiotic details won&#8217;t make or break a potential date. I think this would help a lot.</p>
<p>But the best solution remains the proposal by Rabbi Steven Pruzansky in the Jewish Press last summer. In <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/what-we-can-learn-from-chazal-about-dating/2011/07/07/" target="_blank">What We Can Learn From Chazal About Dating</a>, Rabbi Pruzansky suggests social opportunities for young singles to meet each other. This will increase their pool of friends from one gender to two. I think it is obvious that things will sort themselves out from there. This should be the system. In this future world, people get to know each other in a relaxed setting. There are no résumés, no built-in advantage for the guys, no proud mothers turning away the &#8220;riffraff&#8221;, no 180 degree turn from avoiding the other gender to cultivated a loving relationship with the other gender on demand, and as Rabbi Pruzansky so eloquently says, it is living by the dicta of Chazal.</p>
<p>I hope it becomes the yeshivish system before long. If it does, hopefully we will save our daughters from the horrors of self-image obsession that turn into eating disorders and elective surgery before one can buy a beer.</p>
