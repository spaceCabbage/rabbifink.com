				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7062" alt="174928094" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a>MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is ruffling the feathers of many charedi Gedolim in Israel and America. It seems there are two levels to the rhetoric against MK Lipman.</p>
<p>Primarily, I think many have a problem with him by dint of his association with MK Yair Lapid. It is an article of faith that Lapid is anti-charedi and since MK Lipman is a member of MK Lapid&#8217;s party he is guilty by association. I don&#8217;t think it would be possible to support Yesh Atid and have charedi approval.</p>
<p>Secondarily, many have a problem with MK Lipman&#8217;s positions. I think that his positions are perceived as anti-charedi and therefore anti-Torah. In particular, supporting a requirement that save for specific instances, all charedim participate in the army or national service and join the workforce instead of a blanket exemption for all charedim from service. MK Lipman also supports requiring a basic secular education for all Israelis, no exceptions. By the way, he also supports a better Jewish education for all Israelis, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care to discuss whether charedim are truly the most authentic orthodox Jews or whether they are corrupting Judaism. That&#8217;s a discussion for another time. I want to discuss the reaction of American charedim to MK Lipman&#8217;s proposals.<span id="more-7060"></span></p>
<p>In Israel, a charedi is identified by several social and religious markers. I list them here in no particular order, nor is this list exhaustive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Manner of dress. Charedim wear black and white, sport felt or fur hats, and shun modern style of dress like jeans or T-shirts.</li>
<li>Fear of God. Charedim place God and religion above all else. The word of God is supreme.</li>
<li>Daas Torah. Charedim extend their fealty to the word of God beyond the words of the Written Torah, and even beyond the Oral Law, to include the words of the great rabbis and treat their words like the word of God.</li>
<li>Torah learning is the ultimate service of God. Working for a living is not ideal at best and is actively avoided at worst.</li>
<li>No secular education. Charedim send their children to private schools which do not teach anything that is not found in the Torah.</li>
<li>Rejection of Zionism. The State of Israel is not recognized as a positive development for the Jewish people. It is more likely described as a problem than a solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is your Israeli Charedi checklist.</p>
<p>However in America, people who consider themselves charedi use a different set of parameters.</p>
<p>I think that American charedim subscribe to 1-3, but not necessarily 4-6. The only people in America who truly hold of 4-6 would be chasidim and not all chasidim would agree with 4-6 either. Certainly, many chasidim do not agree with #4 and in America even the chasidic communities are required to give a basic (not sufficient) secular education.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter?</p>
<p>It seems to me, that American charedim are more similar to MK Lipman than they are to Israeli charedim. It is conceivable that MK Lipman could word his platform a little bit differently and still mean the exact same thing. He could say &#8220;I want Israeli charedim to be like American charedim&#8221; and the practical ramifications would be strikingly similar.</p>
<p>I think MK Lipman would be thrilled if Israeli charedim were like Lakewood charedim. They get a secular education, they work (eventually), they even support the State of Israel to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Yet, American gedolim and charedim in America continue to malign MK Lipman and his platform. I don&#8217;t get it. All he is saying is that Israeli charedim should be more like American charedim! He wants them to be like us! They should be flattered. Not insulted!</p>
<p>R&#8217; Ahron Feldman is a Rosh Yeshiva of a yeshiva that is precisely what MK Lipman wants for Israeli charedim and yet he severely criticizes MK Lipman going so far as to call him a rasha. It doesn&#8217;t add up. If what we have in America is good why is it not good for our brothers and sisters in Israel? And even if what they have could be conceived of as better, it&#8217;s not so terrible to be like the American charedim, is it?</p>
<p>True, the two groups share one name &#8211; Charedim. But they are different types of charedim!</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is complicated. Army service can be difficult for charedim. We can understand the reluctance to become less insular and take time away from Torah study. These are reasonable critiques of the sweeping proposals being discussed right now. But let&#8217;s be reasonable. We can talk about the issues and figure out the best way to deal with them.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that there are some potential problems with MK Lipman&#8217;s plan. It&#8217;s not easy to just throw away the old system. There are going to be complications. But I think we will be far more successful if we work together. The plan is not to turn charedim into secular Zi0nists. How about just acting more like American charedim? Seems to me that it should be a workable solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mumps.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6422" title="mumps" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mumps-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" /></a>In 2009 and 2010 there was an outbreak of mumps in three ultra-orthodox charedi Jewish communities. The concentration of the outbreak was in Monsey NY, two areas of Brooklyn NY, and Lakewood NJ. There is no question that the outbreak occurred.</p>
<p>The rabbinic leadership was cognizant of the outbreak and several rabbis issued rulings in response to the outbreak.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that the outbreak was the result of a tendency among some ultra-orthodox families to avoid vaccinating. Mumps has been reduced to the trash-heap of disease because an effective vaccine has been implemented for the last 40 years.<span id="more-6419"></span></p>
<p>However, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy#Full_retraction_and_fraud_allegations" target="_blank">recent study, that has since been debunked and retracted</a>, connected vaccines to autism. Some people took this as a warning not to vaccinate. There is anecdotal evidence that this thinking has taken a stronghold in some of the more ultra-orthodox communities. Subsequently, some rabbis ordered that all families vaccinate, other rabbis advised to vaccinate, other rabbis said that the public had no right to demand that other parents vaccinate. For a full treatment of this issue see the excellent article in Hakirah by Asher Bush: <a href="http://www.hakirah.org/Vol13Bush.pdf" target="_blank">Vaccination in Halakhah and in Practice in the Orthodox Jewish Community</a></p>
<p>So it seemed to the community that the reason for the increase in mumps was the decrease in vaccination vigilance in the community. I am not certain if this is sufficient to explain the outbreak. I am not an expert on this sort of medical analysis but it seems plausible that fewer vaccinations equals more cases and more cases means that the vaccine will be less protective against more challenges to its potency. Again, it makes sense to my mind. Perhaps this is due to a lack of understanding of these matters. But I bought it at the time.</p>
<p>Apparently, this possible solution was not satisfactory to actually doctors. Either they don&#8217;t know that there is a high number of non-vaccinated children in these neighborhoods, or this explanation does not pass scientific muster.</p>
<p>The New England Journal of Medicine published an article with their own solution to this puzzle.</p>
<p>Their opinion is that the cause of the outbreak was chavrusa learning. Orthodox Jewish teenage men study in yeshivas. They have a very rigorous schedule of secular and religious instruction. Much of the time spent on religious studies does not take place in a classroom. They study sitting across from one another at a table. One reads the other listens and interjects with corrections or questions and a discussion ensues. This style of learning is called chavrusa (study partner) learning.</p>
<p>The writers (and there are like 15 of them) of the article in the NEJM propose that prolonged exposure to mumps via a chavrusa could be the reason mumps spread among the ultra-orthodox community. Mumps can be spread through droplets and yelling at your chavrusa from close range can transmit mumps from one person to the next. Chavrusas vary throughout the day and this gives the mumps carrier even more opportunities to spread mumps around the community. Once a large number of teenage boys bring the mumps home, it spreads to the rest of the family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s speculation. But it might be true. The doctors attached to this article seem to think it is compelling enough for the NEJM.</p>
<p>I do NOT think there is any way to spin this as an anti-Semitic position that seeks to eliminate chavrusa learning out of Jew hatred. What I do see is a way in which we are slightly different than our more secular neighbors and sometimes the smallest differences make the biggest difference. In this case it might have contributed to a mumps outbreak.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sandy-space_2382471b.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6404" title="sandy-space_2382471b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sandy-space_2382471b-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>For better or worse, tragedies have a tendency to bring people together. Sure, there are people who take advantage of trying conditions to make a buck, or steal a buck, or just act completely selfishly, but the overall feeling after a tragedy is to come together and help one another survive, grieve, and recover.</p>
<p>With power still out in numerous orthodox neighborhoods, Shabbos will come and many families will need to improvise in order to celebrate Shabbos. For most it will be a different experience than their usual Shabbos. So many people have opened their homes to family and friends who need a place to stay and eat and stay warm over Shabbos. It&#8217;s beautiful to see the camaraderie and concern for others in this time of need.<span id="more-6403"></span></p>
<p>It is one thing to open one&#8217;s home to loved ones or even to acquaintances. It takes another level of concern for others to open one&#8217;s home to complete strangers.</p>
<p>A website has been established for the Ultra-Orthodox community of Lakewood, NJ that is doing just that. The site allows people to post available space in their homes or apartments as well as supplies that are available. Obviously, these are people who are willing to open their homes to complete strangers. I find this to be one level above helping friends and family and deserves high praise.</p>
<p>Reading the listings warms my heart and makes me more than a little emotional. Seeing the open invitations is a real inspiration. It really is beautiful.</p>
<p>Although, for a city with as many orthodox Jews, it seems that the listings are a bit sporadic. I hope it&#8217;s because there are too few people with power and Internet access. Let&#8217;s give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they would have more listings if it were possible.</p>
<p>If you know anyone who could make use of this service even at this late hour, please alert them to these listings. If you</p>
<p>We should be proud of this venture and let us hope and pray that everyone is comfortable and safe over Shabbos. In the long run, let us strive to establish ourselves as a community that rises to this level of kindness even when we are not forced to do so by tragedy.</p>
