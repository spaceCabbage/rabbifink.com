A recent article on Aish.com makes a decent point that the State of Israel did not solve anti-Semitism. Herzl hoped it would end Jew hatred. Clearly it did not.</p>
<p>But for some reason the writer, Rabbi Blech, emphasizes that hatred of Jews is unreasonable and defies logic. Well obviously. Hating anyone for no reason is by definition nonsensical. The odd implication seems to be that hatred of others makes sense and hatred of Jews does not.</p>
<p>I disagree. There is irrational hatred all over the world. Is it rational to hate people because of the color of skin? Is it rational to hate any of the persecuted minorities and ethnic groups? Of course not.</p>
<p>Yet around the world and over the course of history people have been persecuted and hated for being just slightly different. Whether they are different looking, different speaking, different thinking, different anything. There are plenty of excused people give to hate. None of them make a bit of sense. Hate is universal. Us Jewish people have not cornered the market on being hated.<span id="more-6999"></span></p>
<p>I think what makes anti-Semitism unique is that Jews have lived all over the world and been a minority in so many places that we have managed to have more people in more places hate us for no reason than anyone else. Other hated people are more localized. Seems to me, that is a more logical explanation than to create a qualitative distinction between hating Jews and hating everyone else.</p>
<p>Rabbi Blech says the true answer to anti-Semitism is that &#8220;we persist in fulfilling our mission to serve as the world’s conscience until all of mankind learns to acknowledge the beautiful truths of our heritage.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think this is a complete answer. Hatred of Jews defies logic. Being the world&#8217;s conscience won&#8217;t fix stupid.</p>
<p>The more complete antidote to anti-Semitism and all hate is to preach love and tolerance, to find common ground with others, to create opportunities for people to learn more about one another and realize on their own that there is nothing rational about hating people for the simple fact that they are different.</p>
<p>There is no rule that states that people must hate one another in order for the world to spin on its axis. It can end and it will end. But let&#8217;s not limit ourselves to working on Jew hatred. All hate is the same and all hate can be fixed pretty easily.</p>

<p>Yom HaShoah has a slogan: Never Forget.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an odd slogan for a Jewish Holiday. Us Jews, we never forget anything. We have very long memories. We don&#8217;t need to say &#8220;Never Forget&#8221; to remember Yom Kippur every year, nor do we need a slogan to remind us to light Chanukah candles or to host a Pesach Seder. We are very good at remembering both the good times and the bad. Indeed, &#8220;Never Forget&#8221; seems superfluous.</p>
<p>But I think I can explain it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never Forget&#8221; is not a slogan for those who are Jewish and won&#8217;t ever forget. The slogan is for everybody else. We are reminding the rest of the world that they cannot forget the Holocaust. We are not reminding them so that they should mourn with us. We can&#8217;t expect that kind of empathy from the rest of the world. We are reminding the world about the Holocaust so that it should never happen again &#8211; to anyone else.<span id="more-6888"></span></p>
<p>We have been through several Holocausts as a people. We can handle it. It&#8217;s painful and it&#8217;s dreadful, but you don&#8217;t stick around for 3500 years by folding after a Holocaust. We will never forget.</p>
<p>But the world is still a violent place. We have been doing better lately, but there is still genocide, there is still hate, there is still institutionalized oppression. The message of Never Forget is that the world can not forget what happens when hate goes unchecked. The world must remember that the good people of the world must stand in the way of the bad people of the world.</p>
<p>Never Forget means that we must do what it takes to eradicate fundamentalist hatred between groups. We must end oppression of weaker, smaller groups. We cannot let anyone be the victim of hate crimes. We are responsible to end all genocide. That is what it means to &#8220;Never Forget&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sharing the harrowing stories of the Holocaust, hearing heroic stories of survival, appreciating the compassion of those who saved us during the Holocaust are vital to the observance of Yom HaShoah. We all play a role in the dissemination of the message of Yom HaShoah. The short game is to experience Yom HaShoah and feel its emotion for ourselves and our families and our communities. The long game is to use our remembrances to further the broader universal goals to guarantee that the world &#8220;Never Forgets&#8221;, to find common ground with one another, and stand against hate.,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been more than 65 years. As a society, we can do a better job to end genocide and hate crimes. It is our responsibility to do a better job. Mass killings in Syria, Sudan, and Myanmar cry out for our attention. Hate crimes throughout the world remind us that there is still much work to do. Today is a day to do something. Yom HaShoah should be noticed by the world, but not simply as a day to remember the pain of the Holocaust. The world should remember with us. &#8220;Never Forget&#8221; how a world can watch as millions of innocent people are slaughtered. If we can successfully impart this message, we can change our future. We can nudge the international community a little closer to a day where the entire world can live in peace and harmony. It takes work and it takes energy to tell our story to the world. But if we can do it the right way we will guarantee that no one else will ever need a day to say &#8220;Never Forget&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/robot_girl_hiding.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6563" title="robot_girl_hiding" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/robot_girl_hiding-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>In Parshas Vayishlach, Yaakov gears up for a showdown with his brother Eisav. The verse says that Yaakov and his <em>eleven children</em> prepared for the encounter. Rashi quotes the famous Midrash that asks &#8220;where was Dina?&#8221; Seeing as Yaakov officially had twelve children at this point, the text requires explanation.</p>
<p>The answer given by the Midrash is that Yaakov hid Dina away from sight. He did not want Eisav to see Dina because he did not want Eisav to take Dina as a wife. The Midrash continues and says that Yaakov was punished for doing this. He should have given Eisav the opportunity to join his family by marrying Dina. Instead she ended up falling to Shechem.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah is really bothered by this. He asks: Where do we find anything like this? One should be obligated to marry off a daughter to an evil person just so that an evil person might repent? Plus, who knows? Maybe the evil person will influence the righteous daughter to break bad?<span id="more-6559"></span></p>
<p>The Torah Temimah answers  (translation my own, parentheticals are my additions):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <em>It&#8217;s possible to say that Yaakov had no doubt whether Eisav would have repented, it was specifically because of this that Yaakov did not want to marry Dina to Eisav in order that Eisav </em>should not <em>repent. That is to say that Yaakov&#8217;s hate for Eisav (was so great) that he did not want Eisav to repent.</em></p>
<p>I think this is a little bit mind-blowing.</p>
<p>Some interpreters try to idolize and idealize our Bible Heroes. For example, the Daf recently learned the famous Talmudic reinterpretation of Reuven&#8217;s sin in this week&#8217;s parsha as a minor infraction and not adultery. This is a very common form of rabbinic interpretation. It&#8217;s almost jarring to see an interpretation that so humanizes a Patriarch. I also thought it was interested to see Yaakov hating Eisav instead of the usual Eisav hating Yaakov. For some reason, it resonated with me. How about you?</p>

Apparently, there is some opposition that is non-sensical, bigoted and pathetically transparent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad to see that the primary opposition to the eruv is from a yiddish speaking Jew. It&#8217;s also sad to see him so thoroughly embarrassed in the clip. I actually feel bad for the guy as much of a jerk he seems in the clip&#8230;</p>
<p>At the Pacific Jewish Center, we have faced similar opposition to our proposed eruv. And by similar I mean, coming from Jews and equally self contradictory. It is our hope that we will pick up the eruv project for Santa Monica, Venice and Marina del Rey in the near future.</p>
<p>I hope Westhampton gets their eruv and I hope we get ours soon as well. Some commentary below the clip.<span id="more-3961"></span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, an eruv is technically not a loophole. I explained in brief here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/11/the-good-wife-unorthodox-from-a-rabbi-law-student-perspective/">The Good Wife: Unorthodox, From a Rabbi / Law Student Perspective</a> that an eruv is not a loophole. Here is what it is (and this is good for people who actually don&#8217;t know and people who need to explain to people who don&#8217;t know):</p>
<p>The prohibition against carrying on Shabbos is from a private domain to a public domain or a second private domain. One IS permitted to carry within their own home. One is permitted to carry within their own enclosed property (eg: a yard surrounded by a fence). One is permitted to carry from inside their home to their enclosed outdoor property as well. The function of the eruv (which unlike the not so funny joke during the clip does not mean loophole, it means mixture) is to mix / connect many domains into one LARGE private domain. All that is required is a SYMBOLIC enclosure that is halachically considered a wall. A wire running from two poles is sufficient to create a symbolic halachic wall.</p>
<p>Thus, when a wire surrounds a large area that has been designated as a single private domain, joining all the private domains therein into ONE domain, obviously carrying is permitted within that one domain. There are some requirements that need to be met for the large domain to include the private domains. If those requirements are met and there is a unification of many domains via a symbolic, halachic wall, one may carry within that domain exactly as they can carry from room to room within one&#8217;s own home.</p>
<p>Second of all, like I said, it is sad to see Jews pitted against each other. Though, I can&#8217;t assign all blame to the fellow who is against having Orthodox Jewish neighbors. Sometimes Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t make the best neighbors. I don&#8217;t mean this is in an entirely negative way. It&#8217;s normal for Orthodox Jews not to be completely neighborly with their less religious neighbors. They have different standards and different priorities. It can get messy. All I mean to say is that we should be conscious of the opinions of our neighbors and be even more scrupulous to be the best neighbors possible. If we would do that, I am sure we would be less resistance from others to moving to their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Third of all, we see most clearly how ugly bigotry looks when it affects us personally. It is important to try to avoid these kinds of bigoted remarks and behavior in relation to others. Especially after we see how it feels to be a victim of that bigotry. Please keep that in mind next time you say / hear a blanket, statement that could be construed as racist, bigoted, small minded or hateful.</p>

They protested Judaism last week in Brooklyn and they have a case in front of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>I have been asked for predictions and my opinion on the issue.</p>
<p>Luckily, I wrote this paper for a Hate Speech Seminar I took at Loyola Law School in the Summer of 2010. There is some important legal background, a quasi-prediction and alternative suggestion for the future in there. (I was given permission to post the article by my professor.)</p>
<p>I hope you will take the time to read it, think it over and share your thoughts with me.</p>
<p>I try to avoid legalese, but if there is something in there that needs explanation please leave a comment so I can explain it to the best of my ability.</p>

If you are like me, you have been reading about the Rubashkin saga for months. What began with a Federal raid at a meat processing plant to ferret out hundreds of illegal alien employees is now culminating with a federal and state trial. (Link)

<p>If you are like me, you have been reading about the Rubashkin saga for months. What began with a Federal raid at a meat processing plant to ferret out hundreds of illegal alien employees is now culminating with a federal and state trial.<a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/anti-semitic-poster1.jpg"> (</a><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26626858" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that the raid was &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; and fueled by anti-semitism.</p>
<div>
<p>If you are like me you have been hearing that he was denied bail because of an anti-semitic fear that Rubashkin was a flight risk and would flee to Israel.</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that his federal sentencing recommendation was anti-semitic. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/us/29postville.html" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing how the county jail was anti-semitic in not providing food that was kosher &#8220;to Rubashkin&#8217;s standards&#8221; and not permitting him to wear religious garb (tzitzis / tzitzit). (<a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20100509/NEWS/5090342/Rubashkin-dispute-highlights-faith-issue" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>I have three things I want to say.<span id="more-2466"></span></p>
<p>1) I feel terribly for Rubashkin. I feel terribly for any criminal who is sentenced to prison but more-so when the criminal is a family member of mine. As a fellow Jew, Rubashkin is family and it pains me to see him in this state. I support asking for leniency is a mentshlach way.</p>
<p>2) Rubashkin is the cause of much of the animosity towards him from the prosecution and judiciary. It is NOT, I repeat, NOT because he is Jewish, nor is it anti-semitic.</p>
<p>3) Even those who cry anti-semitism in this case are grossly misusing the term.</p>
<p>I think #1 is a well represented opinion throughout the Jewish community. It does not require any more attention from me. Consider me to have said &#8220;ditto&#8221;.</p>
<p>Number 2 is something that has been so wildly misunderstood it almost seems blatant. The reason Rubashkin&#8217;s plant was raided was NOT due to a plan hatched in the bowels of a Ku Klux Klan facility. The reason his plant was raided was because he snubbed the Unions by hiring illegals and the Unions were none-too-happy. They made the infractions known to the Feds and they raided the plant. Were there too many helicopters and fancy weapons? Probably. Was it anti-semitic? Probably not. The people who make these kinds of choices don&#8217;t, actually, CAN&#8217;T have vendettas against minorities. This is the Federal Government of the most benevolent host the Jewish people have ever had. Use your noodle people! There is no conspiracy! Who was president at the time? Our best friend George W. Bush. The federal agents were in his employ. Dare we think that the &#8220;anti-semitic raid&#8221; was orchestrated by our dear friend? Of course not.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Rubashkin was considered a flight-risk because agents found $10,000 cash in a packed bag with passports. Under normal circumstances that is a flight-risk. A packed bag with cash and passports could be reasonably interpreted as a &#8220;just-in-case&#8221; bag. Maybe it was a &#8220;just-in-case Moshiach comes bag&#8221;. I am willing to believe that was the case. But what would you think if you saw that bag and he wasn&#8217;t a frum Jew? Is it anti-semitism to draw the logical conclusion from finding that bag and denying him bail? Certainly not.</p>
<p>The sentencing recommendation was well within Federal guidelines. I was talking about the case to a lawyer friend of mine who works for the Court of Appeals and who knew nothing about the case. I told him some of the facts about the bank fraud. His immediate reaction was, &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was a Jew. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was accused of other crimes. He only knew about the bank fraud and he said &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. Is he anti-semitic? Who cares?! He didn&#8217;t know the cases involved a Jew when he said a life sentence was what the crook deserved!</p>
<p>Also, much has been made of &#8220;comparable criminals&#8221;. It is an unfair comparison because Rubashkin has not been cooperative. He was not willing to accept any plea deals. He maintains his complete, 100% innocence and is a difficult person for the court to deal with. He has many special requests and claims he is being victimized. He has offered only one half-baked apology since this saga began and has not taken any responsibility.</p>
<p>While in jail, Rubashkin has made special requests. Some have been honored and some have not. Some of the requests that have been honored and he has stated that he not satisfied with the kashrus of the food. It is kosher, just not kosher enough. Is it anti-semitic if they give him kosher food that most orthodox Jews would eat?</p>
<p>Also, Rubashkin will not walk without wearing Tzitzis. He states that his religion will not allow him to walk. So he has been carried around so that he will not violate this religious law. The problem is that he is with ignorant of the law or is just trying to be annoying. The law is that when one wears a four-cornered garment (think of a poncho or rectangular wrap) the garment must have a certain formula of strings attached to the garment at the corners. One is not required to wear such a garment. However it has become customary to wear one of these garments with the strings attached for prayer as well as during the day. But if you are not wearing a four-cornered garment the law does not require that you wear the strings (like a button-down shirt or blazer don&#8217;t need the strings). So why is Rubashkin making a stink out of an issue that is not religious? Is it anti-semitic if the jail does not cooperate with this?</p>
<p>I think it is clear enough that for every &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; act against Rubashkin, there is a plausible non-anti-semitic explanation as well. Let&#8217;s just stop with the anti-semitism cries.</p>
<p>As for #3, I dare you to look a Holocaust survivor in the eye and call this anti-semitism. Try telling it to a Jew who was thrown out of Spain and Portugal for not bowing to the Cross. Or how about Jews who were slaughtered during pogroms? Being prosecuted for actual crimes is not anti-semitism. Anti-semitism is hatred and cruelty to Jews for no reason other than the fact that they are Jewish. That is not the case here.</p>
<p>I have more to say about anti-semitism in general. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
