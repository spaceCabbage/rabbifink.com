				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hate-crimes-stop-hating.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7000" alt="hate-crimes-stop-hating" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hate-crimes-stop-hating-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Why do we focus so much on anti-Semitism? A recent article on Aish.com makes a decent point that the State of Israel did not solve anti-Semitism. Herzl hoped it would end Jew hatred. Clearly it did not.</p>
<p>But for some reason the writer, Rabbi Blech, emphasizes that hatred of Jews is unreasonable and defies logic. Well obviously. Hating anyone for no reason is by definition nonsensical. The odd implication seems to be that hatred of others makes sense and hatred of Jews does not.</p>
<p>I disagree. There is irrational hatred all over the world. Is it rational to hate people because of the color of skin? Is it rational to hate any of the persecuted minorities and ethnic groups? Of course not.</p>
<p>Yet around the world and over the course of history people have been persecuted and hated for being just slightly different. Whether they are different looking, different speaking, different thinking, different anything. There are plenty of excused people give to hate. None of them make a bit of sense. Hate is universal. Us Jewish people have not cornered the market on being hated.<span id="more-6999"></span></p>
<p>I think what makes anti-Semitism unique is that Jews have lived all over the world and been a minority in so many places that we have managed to have more people in more places hate us for no reason than anyone else. Other hated people are more localized. Seems to me, that is a more logical explanation than to create a qualitative distinction between hating Jews and hating everyone else.</p>
<p>Rabbi Blech says the true answer to anti-Semitism is that &#8220;we persist in fulfilling our mission to serve as the world’s conscience until all of mankind learns to acknowledge the beautiful truths of our heritage.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think this is a complete answer. Hatred of Jews defies logic. Being the world&#8217;s conscience won&#8217;t fix stupid.</p>
<p>The more complete antidote to anti-Semitism and all hate is to preach love and tolerance, to find common ground with others, to create opportunities for people to learn more about one another and realize on their own that there is nothing rational about hating people for the simple fact that they are different.</p>
<p>There is no rule that states that people must hate one another in order for the world to spin on its axis. It can end and it will end. But let&#8217;s not limit ourselves to working on Jew hatred. All hate is the same and all hate can be fixed pretty easily.</p>

<p>We concluded our two day session on the Talmud and the study of Talmud. The class ran a bit overtime so the audio is a bit longer.</p>
<p>Issues touched upon included why some sections of Mishna have Talmud on them and some do not, why Talmud study is useful, why we study Talmud with a teacher or study partner, how Talmud has been commented on and explained over the last 1500 years.</p>
<p>There are some great anecdotes and insightful questions during the session as well.</p>
