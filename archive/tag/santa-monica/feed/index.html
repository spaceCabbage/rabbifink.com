				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/6049782072_7f51700c2a_b.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6286" title="6049782072_7f51700c2a_b" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/6049782072_7f51700c2a_b.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I rarely post anything on my blog that could be construed as personal or related to my family life. I try very hard to separate the two. This post is a moderate exception.</em></p>
<p>On Friday I moved to Santa Monica CA. I have been the rabbi at The Shul on the Beach in Venice for four years and had been commuting with my family almost every Shabbos and Yom Tov to be at the shul. After four years we decided to make the move and relocate our family from Hancock Park to the beach community. I could not be happier with our decision.</p>
<p>I have been eager to write this post for several years but felt it was disingenuous unless I took my own advice. Now I have, and so here it is&#8230;</p>
<p>The community based around the Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach is mostly made up of residents of Marina del Rey, Venice, and Santa Monica. In my opinion, it is the ideal Jewish community. I believe we have a model worth emulating and a community worth joining. Read on and you&#8217;ll see why I feel this way.</p>
<p><span id="more-6283"></span></p>
<p>On Friday night we sing Shalom Aleichem together after services. Every week we lock arms and sway as we sing the familiar Shabbos tune. I looked around this week and I saw a vibrant but elderly Yemenite Israeli, a Los Angeles native middle-aged baal Teshuva, a traditional 40-something single guy from South Jersey, the academic son of a Conservative Rabbi in his 60s, a young man from Tarzana who usually goes to the Happy Minyan in Pico-Robertson, a young professional who only recently started coming to shul for the first time in his life to say kaddish for his late father, among others. One can&#8217;t help but feel a surge of emotion as the group with its incredibly diverse Jewish backgrounds joined together in welcoming the Shabbos.</p>
<p>On Shabbos morning we had several guests, as usual. One couple was from Lakewood, NJ. They were a typical yeshivish Lakewood couple. Another couple was from Livingston, NJ. They were a borderline modern Orthodox couple. The Lakewood couple said the davening was beautiful and they really enjoyed it. They were surprised how much they liked it and were going to tell their friends to include our shul in their vacation plans. The Livingston couple said that the services and the sermon were perfect for them and they are looking forward to being with us over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Where else in the world can you find such diversity at a minyan? Where else can you find visitors from opposite sides of the orthodox spectrum with the exact same reaction to a shul? Outside the Kotel, there cannot be too many places like that in the world.</p>
<p>This encapsulates our community.</p>
<p>As I am fond of saying, we have ashkenazim and sephardim, Americans, Israelis, South Americans, South Africans, North Africans, Russians, French, Italians, Brits, and Australians, and others who call our shul home. We have baalei teshuva, not-yet baalei teshuva, frum from birth, not frum from birth, or not frum ever, converts, not-yet converts, people who consider themselves orthodox, and people who adamantly do not. We have a little bit of everything. That&#8217;s just the way we like it.</p>
<p>There are places &#8220;out of town&#8221; that can make similar claims. But they are still missing the creature comforts of a large Jewish community like Los Angeles. We are in close proximity to a large variety of schools, several large kosher markets, kosher restaurants, every kind of Torah learning and class, and events for all kinds of Jewish experiences. This is a very unique combination that marries the benefits of out of town life with living in a thriving orthodox community.</p>
<p>Living in a fairly insular orthodox Jewish community can be an unbelievable experience. Many people thrive in that kind of environment. I do not question the wisdom of insular communities. However, I do know that they do not work for everyone. I know this because it doesn&#8217;t really work for me. But know it doesn&#8217;t work for other people because of the emails I get on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Some people feel intimidated in insular communities. Some people feel lost in insular communities. Some people want be in a diverse environment for whatever reason. Some people want a shul where they can meet people from different social circles. Some people want a shul where they can make a difference in the lives of complete strangers. Some people just don&#8217;t fit into the expected molds within the insular communities. Some people would like to have neighbors from different backgrounds and religious beliefs. Some people, whether justified or not, feel like they are constantly under scrutiny or are &#8220;being judged&#8221; in more insular communities.</p>
<p>Those kinds of people are likely to be frustrated by insular orthodox Jewish communities. They might be unhappy. They might feel left out. They might even resent the community and sometimes they resent Judaism by association.</p>
<p>This is very unfortunate.</p>
<p>I know it can seem daunting and maybe even a little crazy, but I have an offer for those people: Try the Pacific Jewish Center community. Our community is the kind of environment where anyone can thrive. Everyone has their own space and there is room for all kinds of people. The core of the community is strong and is welcoming to anyone.</p>
<p>You can be part of a community that makes a huge difference in the lives of many people. Uniquely situated on the Venice Boardwalk &#8211; literally on the beach, thousands of people pass our shul every week. A lot of them stop in and say hi. Some of those people stay for a little while and find a small sliver of inspiration in those moments. Some of them become part of the shul and our community. But even the people who do not have the time or the courage or the interest to poke their head into the shul, are affected by the shul. They see a shul in a very unlikely place and it gives them pause. It causes to think and consider their Judaism, or if they are not Jewish, their religion, or if they are not religious, their personal path. The shul functions on its most basic level as a landmark that says to people that they should stop and contemplate their lives. Some people want to be part of something special like that.</p>
<p>My life goal is to make Torah and Judaism as accessible to as many people as possible. I try to do that on the blog in many ways. One way is to give a voice to those who have legitimate complaints. Another way is to start a conversation about contemporary orthodox Judaism. That is why I do my Daf Yomi and put it online. I want people to be able to learn Torah in short bursts if they don&#8217;t have the time or interest in an hour long class. That is what I do at the shul as well. The programs and services are designed to present Torah and Judaism in an accessible way to the maximum number of people possible.</p>
<p>To underscore this point, there are people who come to our shul that might not go to shul anywhere else. We are proud of that.</p>
<p>I want people out there to know that if you are not in love with your community and shul, you can be. You just need to find the right place for you and your family. For more people than not, the Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach can be that place. If insular communities don&#8217;t work for you, see if you are able to join us for a Shabbos. Try us out. See if you feel the magic of The Shul on the Beach. Most people do.</p>
<p>(Are there reasons not to live here? Yes. There is no eruv, yet. Housing is expensive. It is a bit of a commute to the schools. Some people find the beach-like atmosphere a great spiritual challenge. There are reasons not to join our community. But those reasons do not outweigh the benefits for people who feel like they don&#8217;t fit in where they are currently living. And the beach lifestyle has much to offer. There is a conscious focus on health and wellbeing, people walk, they buy their produce from Farmer&#8217;s Markets, they ride their bikes, it is a more relaxed, less urban lifestyle.)</p>
<p>At the very least, think about it. If you&#8217;ve been feeling out of place in your own home, give us a shot. If you know someone who could use a place where they would feel more at home tell them to check us out.</p>
<p>I hope to see you all at The Shul on the Beach sometime soon&#8230;</p>

As usual, I met some very interesting and wonderful people through the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Many people stopped by to dip the apple in the honey which is not as easy as it looks with the nice ocean breeze wreaking havoc with honey drips. Some stepped into the shul for a few moments and we had some lovely conversations. Everyone got free apples and honey and an open invitation to join us at the Shul on the Beach for High Holidays services.</p>
<p>Of all the people that stopped by, three were of particular interest.<span id="more-6213"></span></p>
<p>One guy was an Iranian Muslim. He said his father was very religious and used to pray his morning services for three hours. It only takes a few minutes for most people, but his father was so pious that it took him hours. Then he told me the entire story of Muhammad. He said his father had great respect for Jewish people and used to study the Torah. This fellow is not Muslim. He claims he is &#8220;everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then there was the film student from Boston. She recently came to LA as part of a program with Boston University. Earlier that day her mother was guilting her about where she was going to go to hear the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah. So she told her mom she didn&#8217;t know yet, but she was definitely going to services &#8220;on the beach&#8221;. She had never even heard of shul but when she saw the shul she said it was &#8220;<em>beshert</em>&#8220;! Now she is planning on joining us for services. Her mother will be happy.</p>
<p>My third encounter was with an Intactvist across the way. He gets his own post. Tune in tomorrow for my conversation with the Venice Boardwalk Intactivist.</p>
<p>The High Holidays are a magical time everywhere. But at The Shul on the Beach they are particularly inspiring. Jews from every walk of life, with every level of observance, and of every background join together for services. Everyone is welcome and everyone is made to feel welcome. We invite you to join us.</p>
<p><strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> is September 16 at sundown through nightfall on September 18. Shofar blowing at The Shul on the Beach will be around 11 AM on September 17 and 18.</p>
<p><strong>Yom Kippur</strong> is September 25 at sundown for K0l Nidre through nightfall on September 26.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to join us for services whether for the entire thing or just a few moments. If you want a seat with your name on it, call or email the PJC office at info@pjcenter.com.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/shangri_la.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6083" title="shangri la santa monica" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/shangri_la.jpg?resize=300%2C226" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Jewish Press is reporting that a very fancy Santa Monica hotel, the Shangri-La is being sued by a Jewish man. <a href="pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Our shul</a> is just a couple miles south of the Shangri-La. The suit alleges that two years ago a group of young Jewish professionals were hosting an event at the hotel on behalf of Friends of the IDF. They claim that they had made all the proper arrangements with the hotel in advance and the hotel cooperated with them when they arrived. The hotel had a security and logistics meeting about the event.</p>
<p>Not too long after the group checked-in, the owner of the hotel, the daughter of a Pakistani Muslim real estate mogul, told the staff to remove the Jewish guests. They were easy to identify by their blue wristbands they were wearing in support of the IDF.</p>
<p><span id="more-6082"></span></p>
<p>The hotel claims that the group did not make the necessary arrangements with the hotel in advance and thus were trespassing on hotel property when they were ousted. However, the attorney for the plaintiffs told the Jewish Press that the defendants were unable to provide any evidence to support their allegation that the group was trespassing. Further, the hotel owner was overheard telling hotel staff that her father would disown her if she did not have the Jews removed from the hotel.</p>
<p>While removing the Jews from the premises, the hotel staff were looking for Jewish guests and identifying them by their blue wristbands. The Jewish Press says this evokes the use of yellow stars to identify Jews during the Holocaust. An apt comparison, if a bit dramatic.</p>
<p>It is surprising that this case is proceeding to trial. I would have expected a quiet settlement. A trial will likely make this case a bit of a spectacle and that is unfortunate for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Are there Americans who bear hatred for Jews? Absolutely. Do I think that this situation is motivated by hatred for Jews? As the facts present themselves at this point, I do. It pains me terribly that bigots still exist.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t expect everyone to be accommodating and tolerant. I hope they can be and will be accommodating and tolerant, but hatred runs deep and it is very difficult to deprogram people, especially if they are not willing to be reprogramed. Many people are small-minded and tribal. But it can be overcome.</p>
<p>I also think that this fellow is making the proper response. The courts are equipped to handle this kind of behavior and it is far better than vigilantism that I have seen some other people promoting. I also strongly suggest that Jews not use this hotel in the future and urge all tolerant and loving non-Jewish people to avoid the Shangri-La in Santa Monica. A place that acts in this manner does not deserve the support or respect of the broader community.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the matter will be resolved fairly and the owners of the Shangri-La will learn an important lesson. Bigotry and hate are not tolerated in America. When you come here, you need to leave your prejudice and racism behind.</p>
<p>Most of all, I hope that the Jewish people can be a model of respect, tolerance, and love for all. We have been through the wringer over the last 2000 years. We have never been guests in a place as tolerant and multi-cultural as the United States of America. We, of all people, can appreciate the gift of American freedom and we should be ambassadors for that freedom. We should strive to teach tolerance and acceptance of others in our communities. It is an important value, and in our more insular communities it is in danger of being lost or forgotten without direct instruction.</p>
<p>This case is an embarrassment to Santa Monica, to Los Angeles, to California, and to the United States of America. Let us hope is it the last such case on American soil, and eventually the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world famous Pella Singers performed at our Chanukah lighting on Santa Monica Promenade a c0uple of weeks ago. It was a great event. People from all over the world joined in for a few minutes of our Chanukah celebration.</p>
<p>The news cameras were there. I was interviewed by KABC-TV for a segment that never aired. But KTLA did broadcast a small piece of the gathering. We&#8217;ll take it!</p>

That time of year when everyone is supposed to be preparing for their respective holidays full of good cheer and spirits. What ends up happening is people tripping over themselves to be insulted or to make statements about their beliefs.</p>
<p>First, a bit of history. It might be that a lot of the grumbling comes from not understanding what this time of year really means for various people of various religions and faiths.</p>
<p>People have been celebrating holidays around the winter solstice for eons.</p>
<p>The Talmud makes the claim that Adam initiated the first winter solstice celebration. Having been created in the fall (Tishrei) and having sinned almost immediately upon his creation, Adam believed that he was being punished with less and less daylight. The day after the solstice he realized that such was the way of the world and the daylight period would be getting longer and longer. The next year he celebrated the 8 days preceding the solstice and the 8 days following the solstice as holidays. (BT Avodah Zara 8a). The Mishna which is being discussed in that Talmudic statement notes that there were several pagan holidays that were celebrated around the winter solstice during the Mishnaic era (circa 70-200 CE).</p>
<p>Clearly, there are very old sources that all orthodox Jews deem reliable indicating that this time of year was marked by celebrations. These celebrations predate Christmas and in the instance of Adam, predate Chanukah as well. Further, if the pagan celebrations noted in the Mishna were a few centuries old at the time, those holidays predate Chanukah as well. This is all according traditional, ancient Jewish sources.<span id="more-4941"></span></p>
<p>Although Christmas celebrates the birth of the Christian religion, it was not celebrated widely for the first 1000 years of Christianity. Slowly, through the middle ages the holiday gained prominence. About 300 years ago the holiday was already very popular with many Christians but some of the factions breaking off from mainstream Christianity at the time deemed it a pagan holiday and banned its celebration. The Puritans, famous for their establishing of colonies on American soil fined anyone who dared celebrate this holiday. The holiday is not found in scripture so it was presumed by them to have been borrowed from pagans and was impure.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 19th century Christmas became a universally accepted Christian holiday. The Christmas Tree was incorporated into the celebration as well. Later, in the 20th century, the imagery of Santa Claus, his elves, toy soldiers, gingerbread cookies and other familiar Christmas symbols made their way into the lore.</p>
<p>The holiday surged in popularity and then in the 21st century, non-Christians began to feel barraged by the overt religious overtones of the celebrations taking place on &#8220;neutral ground&#8221;. The ACLU, atheist groups and others began asking, sometimes demanding, that Christmas not be celebrated in public places.</p>
<p>Many Christmas celebrators took offense to this. Plenty of arguments have been invoked trying to establish a reason that Christmas celebrations should be allowed in public schools, municipal parks, government facilities, retail stores and pretty much anywhere and everywhere else. Jon Stewart and Bill O&#8217;Reilly have been going on about this for years and Rick Perry spurned an Internet meme with his opinion.</p>
<p>Rabbi Adlerstein on Patheos and the LA Times have reported on the Santa Monica war over Christmas. For years, an elaborate Nativity scene decked the halls of a Santa Monica park. There are 21 spots for holiday displays. A number of groups entered a lottery to determine who would get the spots. Atheist groups won 14 of the spots, Jewish groups got three and the rest went to the Nativity.</p>
<p>The atheists are being pretty mean spirited about the whole thing. They are using this as a platform to poke fun and mock religious people. That&#8217;s not very nice. But I wonder how they would have responded if the displays had not been religious, i.e. The Nativity, and instead were the cultural symbols of Santa, peppermint candy and reindeer. Many of the Christmas displays are not signs of religion per se, rather a new-age version of a Christian holiday with winter symbolism that is not inherently religious.</p>
<p>Although, I don&#8217;t agree with Rabbi Adlerstein and many other religious Jews as well as Christians who want more Christmas displays. Last week I was at Disneyland with my family. The daily parade was holiday themed. Our younger son really, really wanted to see many of his favorite Disney characters who were not out and about during the day. We figured we would see them during the parade so even though we were not interested in the Christmasness of the parade we stayed to watch. He was thrilled and in that respect it was the right choice.</p>
<p>I watched the parade carefully. There was not one ounce of religion in the parade. Nothing that was particularly Christian or related to Jesus. There were reindeer, there were red hats, Santa and the Mrs. paraded on by, scenes from the Nutcracker, and other holiday stories were represented and there was a tree. But literally nothing in the parade was religious. Yet, we were all very uncomfortable. The symbols of Christmas have become part and parcel of the religious holiday despite not really being intrinsically related to the religious holiday. In other words, even though the parade was not religious, it offended our Jewish sensitivities. This was not our holiday. We were guests. It was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Disney can do as it sees fit. But as a consumer I was disappointed. What is usually a highlight of the day was uncomfortable for everyone over the age of 3 because they chose to integrate a Christian holiday into a celebration of fun, magic and fantasy. It is unfortunate. And I can completely relate to the atheists who are offended by similar displays of holiday spirit and cheer even when stripped of their specifically religious elements.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t justify their over the top protest. Not at all. But I do believe that public religious and symbolic displays that are Christmas and Christian-centric are not inclusive and do not need to be tolerated anywhere and everywhere by the non-Christian public.</p>

Yesterday we hosted a Klezmer concert on the Beach and it was a smashing success!</p>
<p>Dr. Ellie Goldstein&#8217;s close friend has been playing for Dr. Goldstein and his friends at Dr. Goldstein&#8217;s home for many years. Ron Grun (along with Ken Husbands) are very talented klezmer musicians and close friends of Dr. Goldstein.</p>
<p>Over the last year, PJC has been privileged to have Dr. Goldstein and his friends join our shul. One of the many perks of their involvement was the concert taking place in the shul.<span id="more-2773"></span></p>
<p>About 60-70 people attended the concert and many others stopped by for a quick listen and carried on their way along the boardwalk. We are so appreciative that Dr. Goldstein shared the concert with us and the entire beach community.</p>
<p>The concert was great. I confess to not being a Konnoisseur of Klezmer and I was very impressed. The music was great wonderful and the explanations that our performers provided were very interesting. I am so glad that so many folks were able to join us and stop by to get a taste of our shul and the friendliness of our community.</p>
<p>We look forward to more events like this in the future.</p>
<p>If case you missed it, here is a sample of the concert. (And next time be there!)</p>

We are located right on the edge of Venice near the Santa Monica border. Many of our Shul members live in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>So, it is fair to say I have spent these last two Chanukahs in Santa Monica. Sure it&#8217;s different from Northeast. We never will have a &#8220;white Chanukah&#8221;. We had our Chanukah party on the beach with a moon-bounce outside. People are wearing shorts. It was 73 degrees today. It feels a little different, but we&#8217;re not complaining.</p>
<p>Turns out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer" target="_blank">Tom Lehrer</a> agrees with me. Chanukah is way better in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll tell you about it himself, just watch this&#8230;<span id="more-1935"></span></p>

<p>As the Shul on the Beach, a community institution, we are charged with the responsibility and opportunity to bring Judaism to the boardwalk. Our Chanukah party, the first in a series of events and programs designed to reach that end was incredible.</p>
<p>Thank yous are in order to Jeff Liss for organizing, planning and executing the whole thing. Thank you so much. Many others contributed as well and for that we express our appreciation to you as well.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing how many people came through our doors today,<span id="more-1866"></span>but it was a very large number. Rabbi Mintz was particularly effective at luring passers by into the shul. Thank you so much! The shul was packed with community members as well as many passers-by ranging from observant friends to completely unaffiliated Jews as well as many curious non-Jews.</p>
<p>I had the fortune of meeting some wonderful people. Like the father of an adorable daughter whose expectant wife was home. He thought a Chanukah Party would be the perfect way for this non-Jewish father to celebrate with his Jewish daughter. He noted, that as soon as possible, he will be bringing his wife and, God-willing, twin daughters, when mom and babies are up and about. He cited the generosity and friendliness of the community members as impressive.</p>
<p>I met people from all over Los Angeles. Locals, from Santa Monica and Venice. From all over Los Angeles from as far as the Valley to Marina del Rey. I met visitors from Chicago, New Jersey, Miami, Israel and the UK. It was truly a universal Chanukah celebration.</p>
<p>Once inside everyone was treated to warm hospitality, friendliness and traditional Chanukah foods. (Of course there was food.) Towards the end of the party I spoke to the remaining crowd and the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-address/" target="_blank">audio has been posted here</a>.</p>
<p>Our very talented Office Manager, Leslie Friedman took a lot of great photos. You can see them in a slideshow below. If you spot yourself leave us a comment and say hi!</p>
