<p>You may recall that I a little while ago I met and befriended an incarcerated woman named Judith Clark. See: <a title="Permanent link to My Visit With Judith Clark at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility" href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/29/my-visit-with-judith-clark-at-bedford-hills-prison/" rel="bookmark">My Visit With Judith Clark at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility</a>.</p>
<p>Judy is a Jewish woman who is serving a 75 year prison sentence for her role as a getaway driver in a famous Brinks truck robbery in my hometown of Monsey NY that left several men dead, some 30 years ago. The robbery was for the benefit of a far-left extremist group. Her sentence was severe and it was mostly because she treated the trial as an opportunity to make anti-government statements. She viewed herself as a martyr for her cause and did not cooperate during the proceedings.</p>
<p>Supporters of Judy were hoping for clemency last December. When that did not come, many of us were very disappointed. It seemed that her best chance at freedom had passed her by.</p>
<p>You may ask, why I would support clemency for a woman who played a role in several deaths.<span id="more-5036"></span> The short answer is that I don&#8217;t. The woman I met, the woman I support, is absolutely a different woman that the woman who participated in those heinous acts three decades prior. The Judy Clark from 1981 has been transformed into a new and improved Judy Clark. A woman, who by all accounts, gives every indication that she has been rehabilitated. Even the most cynical view is that she &#8220;only reformed herself to get out of prison&#8221;. But there is no doubt she has reformed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rare case, where a person actually changes for the better while prison. It&#8217;s at least as rare as people who change their lives while not in prison. And we all know how hard and rare it is to change one&#8217;s life. Supporting Judy Clark is supporting the human spirit and its ability to improve. It is supporting a woman with an infectious smile and important message despite her shortcomings. I support a woman who admits her mistakes, regrets them very much and tries tirelessly to make a positive difference in others.</p>
<p>The article in the NY Times magazine is an in-depth look at Judy, her circumstances and her supporters. Two of those supporters mentioned in the article have become friends of mine through Judy. If you want a full picture of what happened in 1981, what happened in the 30 years since and the reactions from across the spectrum of supporters and opponents of Judy I strongly suggest reading the article.</p>
<p>Most of all, I urge you to consider what our justice system should do when someone in prison genuinely changes their life. When someone does <em>teshuva</em> and repents for what they have done, how long must they suffer for their previous errors?</p>

(As opposed to this &#8220;Great Idea&#8221;: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/15/an-interesting-alternative-to-prison/">An Interesting Alternative to Prison</a>)</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the front page of the NY Times ran an article about criminal registries. A few states and local districts are considering online registries for criminals similar to the online sex offender registry.</p>
<p>The offenses being considered as grounds for registration range from arson to animal abuse.</p>
<p>The basic arguments for the registry are that the public has the right to know and make decisions about law breakers in their neighborhoods. If I don&#8217;t want to live near a dangerous (or not so dangerous criminal) I have that right.</p>
<p>The basic arguments against the registry? There are quite a few.<span id="more-4267"></span></p>
<p>What is the point of the registry?</p>
<p>To protect those who know about it? Does it really protect them? Are you really less safe around a a known offender than an unknown offender?</p>
<p>To isolate the offenders? So that they have nowhere to live? No where to work? Will that help them get their lives back together? If no one moves near the offenders and no one gives them jobs because they are on a list, how will they reintegrate into society?</p>
<p>There is a registry for drunk drivers in Maine. How in the world does this help or protect anyone? Drunk drivers can drive anywhere they want. And they are probably more likely to drive drunk near the bars than near their homes.</p>
<p>There is a registry to murderers proposed in Illinois. Murder recidivism rates are very very low. That means that if a convicted murderer is released from prison they are very unlikely to commit another murder. So a list of murderers has low utility but creates huge stigma.</p>
<p>Not to mention the cost. These lists are very expensive to set up and maintain.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t these kinds of lists also give rise to vigilantism? I don&#8217;t know. But the more lists we have, the greater risk there is for offenders.</p>
<p>Also, at least in LA, most crime happens in certain neighborhoods between specific groups of people. (You know what I mean&#8230;) Registries of those kinds of offenders seem pretty useless to me. Spending tons of money to basically have a public list of gang members? Who rarely venture out of their own neighborhoods?</p>
<p>But most of all, the registries represent an absolute lack of faith in our criminal justice system. If criminals who have gone through the system are still dangerous, then the system has failed them. Why put them behind bars at all if they are the same person who went in?</p>
<p>If we are aware that the system is failing then the solution is certainly not to make a list of all the people for whom the system failed. It&#8217;s TO FIX THE SYSTEM. Legislation for registries makes law makers appear tough on crime. Tough on crime accomplishes nothing in the long term. Registries aren&#8217;t even tough on crime, they APPEAR to be tough on crime. We don&#8217;t need faux toughness to solve our criminal justice issues. We need reform.</p>
<p>The suggestion of these registries is a wake up call. Our system needs fixing. Rehabilitate criminals. Create social solutions to battle the factors that create crime. Get involved in the high crime neighborhoods and instead of counting collars, count crimes prevented.</p>
<p>Registries are a wasteful way of pretending to solve a problem. Sorry, it&#8217;s not going to work. Try again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/britannica_prison.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3887" title="britannica_prison" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/britannica_prison-300x206.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="206" /></a>I was on a plane the other day and the fellow one row ahead of me across the aisle had a copy of the New York Times. It was cool because it was made out of a flimsy paper and was printed with cheap ink that smears. It was also mostly black and white. It must have been an old person version of NYTimes.com.</p>
<p>Anyway, there was a big headline that I was able to see from my vantage point and I really wanted to read the article. But how do you tell someone that you were reading over their shoulder and want to know if they could let you read an article from their newspaper. Luckily, I realized that this old person version of the NY Times might also be available on NYTimes.com. (All kidding aside, I actually miss the feel of a newspaper in my hands as opposed to reading the Times online.)</p>
<p>When I got back to in front of a computer I found it.</p>
<p>Christian Longo is a murderer. He committed a heinous crime and after years of denial and self-denial has come to grips with the horror of what he has done. He is ready to die for his actions and that is where he is headed. Christian is on death row in Oregon. He is 37 years old.<span id="more-3886"></span></p>
<p>Waiting for execution must be the most excruciating feeling. I can&#8217;t even begin to imagine what it feels like and I can&#8217;t imagine the thoughts that go through the head of someone on death row.</p>
<p>I imagine that a prevalent sentiment on death row is the wish to do good with the time they have left. The finality of capital punishment must give even the most hardened the desire to leave some sort of legacy beside their crimes. Yet, it can be really hard to &#8220;do good&#8221; behind prison walls.</p>
<p>Christian is struggling with this. He wants to do something good. In his mind, giving life would be an appropriate way to &#8220;do good&#8221; in the wake of his murderous life. So Christian has requested that his organs be donated to some of the people awaiting organs for life saving transplants. Some states use an execution method that would harm the organs. But Oregon, where Christian is incarcerated uses a toxin that leaves the organs alone which opens to door to allow harvesting of Christian&#8217;s organs to save the lives of others. His organs can save up to 8 people. EIGHT PEOPLE!</p>
<p>He has been denied. <em>&#8220;The interests of the public and condemned inmates are best served by denying the petition.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s basically &#8220;legalese&#8221; for &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reasons cited by Christian in his editorial range from the reasonable to the ridiculous.</p>
<p>Some are concerned about health. (They can test.)</p>
<p>Others think inmates may escape if we use their organs. (huh?)</p>
<p>Yet others worry that inmates will be taken advantage of and forced to donate their organ. (I can hear this but as Christian writes, reassurances are possible.)</p>
<p>Personally, I think the public thinks they are punishing inmates further by denying them the right to donate their organs. This is dumb. Organ donation is not a &#8220;privilege&#8221;. I wonder if those denying Christian the opportunity to donate his organs to those who need life saving organs would be comfortable looking the ill people in the eye and saying &#8220;you can&#8217;t live because the person who wants to give you organs is a prisoner&#8221;. It all seems twisted to me.</p>
<p>Dehumanizing inmates to the point that they cannot even save the lives of another is another indictment on our prison system. At the very least, those who can save lives should be able do so. Even if they are on death row.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/prison.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2714" title="prison" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/prison-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>I have visited a prison and a jail. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/29/my-visit-with-judith-clark-at-bedford-hills-prison/">My Visit With Judith Clark at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility</a>) I have learned a lot about the failures of our current system of incarceration and it sickens me. As a (relatively) outspoken individual I have made my opinions known to anyone who will listen.</p>
<p>I tell them that I am against prison in principle. I don&#8217;t think anyone should go to prison. It&#8217;s a waste of money and far worse it is a waste of a human being. People accomplish almost nothing while incarcerated. Society gives them a free ride and they produce next to nothing for society.</p>
<p>The first response I hear is usually related to the safety of society. That somehow we, on the outside, are safer if the criminals are isolated, on the inside.<span id="more-2713"></span> While this is generally true, most crimes do not affect the middle or upper class of society . Most crimes are not violent. Most criminals that go to prison have someone step into their place in their social circle and the crimes continue. I know this is a pretty weak position, but I think that incarceration is also a weak position.</p>
<p>The next thing that I hear is almost always a challenge. &#8220;Do you have a better solution?&#8221; To which I have been saying &#8220;I think so&#8221;. Prisons are as an old insitution. They hearken back to a time that it was the only option for incapacitation. The loss to society caused by providing criminals with a prison was worthwhile because there was no other real option. Incarceration is a old system that was the best they could do.</p>
<p>I propose that criminals be monitored. Conviction of a crime is a waiver of one&#8217;s privacy. There is no privacy in jail. Instead of tossing them in a cell and monitoring that way, criminals should be monitored by corrections officers. They can be mother or fathers to their families. They must find jobs, they must be productive members of society and  only if they lapse back into crime would they go to jail.</p>
<p>To me, this was a sci-fi idea that I had no way of determining its effectiveness or cost. Monitoring was a idea, but just an idea with no real data to back up the idea.</p>
<p>Last week I read a very well written article in The Atlantic (I don&#8217;t regularly read The Atlantic, I saw the article linked on Gizmodo) about Monitoring.</p>
<p>It demonstrates the feasibility of the idea and its preference over incarcertation for all but the most dangerous criminals. It explains how badly the current system is failing and the attractiveness of this alternative solution.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the article and I highly recommend the system as described in the article.</p>
<p>Currently, it costs about $50,000 a YEAR to incarcerate a criminal in California. No wonder we have a budget crisis. Monitoring is a much cheaper solution. It is a more humane solution. It is a more productive solution. It is the solution of the future.</p>
<p>The only question that remains is how long will it take us to reach &#8220;the future&#8221;.</p>
<p>I say, the future is now.</p>

(Read: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/14/ive-been-published-my-article-on-felony-murder-is-online-now/">I’ve Been Published! My Article On Felony Murder Is Online</a>)</p>
<p>In researching the subject of Felony Murder I was introduced to the case of Judith Clark by Professor Gilda Zwerman who accompanied me to visit with Judith. Judith Clark has a website all about her crime, time served and the way she has rehabilitated her life while in prison. (Link: <a href="http://www.judithclark.org/" target="_blank">http://www.judithclark.org</a>)</p>
<p>On Monday I had the opportunity to spend a couple hours with her in prison. It was very powerful.<span id="more-2684"></span></p>
<p>First, my overall impressions of the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility:</p>
<p>The prison experience at Bedford Hills contrasted greatly with my experience at &#8220;Twin Towers&#8221; in Los Angeles (largest jail in the USA). At Twin Towers there is a lot of intake and outtake. The inmates are constantly moving around, the entire facility is indoors and there is almost no sunlight anywhere. Bedford Hills is a sprawling campus with sunlight and grass. It gives it a totally different feel.</p>
<p>Also, the inmates had an different temperament from the inmates at Twin Towers. The women of Bedford Hills seemed pretty pleasant, there were a lot smiles and hugs and friendliness. At Twin Towers it was very much the opposite.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about Bedford Hills was their nursery / summer children&#8217;s program. They have great child care for children born while their mother&#8217;s are incarcerated. Even better is the summer program. Children stay in the neighborhood and come from 9-5 every day to spend the day with their mothers. The prison provides a nice outdoor area for them to play and hang out with their mothers and I got a great first-hand view of the benefits of a program like this. The kids were having such a great time being with their mothers.</p>
<p>On to Judith:</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that I could not stop smiling while talking to her. She has such a great energy and infectuous disposition that you just find yourself smiling the entire time you are with her. We talked for a long time about the crime and her Judaism and her daughter and her appeal (which she won but was later overturned for technical reasons) and her famous writing club and her pursuit of multiple degrees and her close relationship with the previous warden at Bedford Hills.</p>
<p>In short, we had a great time talking.</p>
<p>What was clear to me, was her regret for being involved with a radical group and her sincere effort to change as a person. I don&#8217;t think she is the same person she was 30 years ago. I do think that she is an incredibly strong woman with the ability to help inspire and change others. Unfortunately, she is stuck behind bars.</p>
<p>Her sentence was harsh. She pretty much asked for a harsh sentence during the trial. But she was young, immature and infatuated with a movement. That person is not in prison. That person has transformed into a new person who could do no harm the way she is now.</p>
<p>We put people in jail for a few reasons. Deterrence,  incapacitation, rehabilitation and retribution.</p>
<p>30 years in prison is a strong deterrent.</p>
<p>Judith Clark is not a dangerous criminal, there is no need to incapacitate her anymore.</p>
<p>Judith Clark is rehabilitated. I can attest to that.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t 30 years long enough for retribution? Retribution for driving a getaway car?</p>
<p>Seeing her in there breaks my heart.</p>
<p>But with my heart broken, I was once again inspired by Judith. Just before my visit was over she said &#8220;<em>If I died tomorrow how would I feel about my life? I&#8217;ve had a good life. It was severely limited by the walls of this prison, but I accomplished a lot and I am proud of who I am.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that what we all wish we could honestly say?</p>
