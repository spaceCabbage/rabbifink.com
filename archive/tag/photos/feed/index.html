				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/venice.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-7191" alt="IMG_1506" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/venice-300x286.jpg" width="210" height="200" /></a>There is a Talmudic mystery that has perplexed Torah scholars for centuries.</p>
<p>Normally the Talmud is a free flowing conversation. Each new topic that is discussed is properly headed or is a segue from a previous conversation. On Sanhedrin 43A, the Talmud abruptly ends the conversation and picks up the conversation on 43B with an unrelated topic. Some scholars have offered creative suggestions that connect the two but no interpretations are sufficiently satisfactory.</p>
<p>The mystery has been already been solved. Here are 10 incredible photos of three versions of one book of the Talmud that tell the story of this mystery and its solution. Come with me on a Talmudic journey spanning 5 centuries.<span id="more-2556"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>1. Standard Edition Talmud</strong></span></p>
<p>When you look at a typical Gemara Sanhedrin and open it to the page with 42B and 43A this is what you see. Text of the Mishna and Gemara in the center and Rashi and Tosfos on the outside of the page with Rashi near the binding and Tosfos on the edges.</p>
<div><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082923_f05a9d2e76_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7172" alt="IMG_1550" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082923_f05a9d2e76_o-1024x768.jpg" width="559" height="419" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>The thing that immediately jumps out at you is all that white space under the text of 43A. The second thing that would jump out at you if you were studying this folio is that there is no apparent connection between the end of 43A and the start of 43B. For many years this bothered Talmudic scholars.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>2. Lots of White Space</strong></span></p>
<p>Here is a clearer view of just 43A. Note all the white space</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082655_b4c5dcf1e8_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7173" alt="IMG_1549" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082655_b4c5dcf1e8_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>3. The Zhitomer Talmud Has the Same Problem</strong></span></p>
<p>This problem is not just a recent one. Below is a photograph of the same folio from the Zhitomer edition of the Talmud. This edition was printed in 1859. The above photos are from the Vilna edition of the Talmud that is used today and was first printed in the 1880&#8242;s. As you can see, the Zhitomer edition suffers from the same white space and as expected has the exact same text as the Vilna edition.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523718154_901d163a05_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7169" alt="IMG_1555" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523718154_901d163a05_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>4. A Closer View of the Zhitomer</strong></span></p>
<p>Here is a closer view of the end of the Zhitomer 43A.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523719376_cb9869ba70_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7165" alt="IMG_1559" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523719376_cb9869ba70_o-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>5, 6, and 7. A Volume of the Talmud almost 500 Years Old</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Here is where it gets interesting. The first printed edition of the Talmud was printed in Venice (not California) in 1549. Incredibly, some of these editions are still in circulation. My grandfather OB&#8221;M was an avid collector of antique <em>seforim</em> and owned a copy of Sanhedrin from the Venice edition of the Talmud. (He owned several Venice volumes.) Below are 3 photos of the spine of that volume.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523707200_a051d7db2f_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7187" alt="IMG_1510" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523707200_a051d7db2f_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706940_eb6d750e38_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7186" alt="IMG_1509" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706940_eb6d750e38_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706636_ea6620d603_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7185" alt="IMG_1507" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706636_ea6620d603_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>8. The Oldest Printed Version of Sanhedrin 43A</strong></span></p>
<p>If we turn the page to 43A we notice something incredible. No white space. If we take a closer look we will see that 9 extra lines of text are present in the Venice edition. See below.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523715588_9664faaabf_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7163" alt="IMG_1545" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523715588_9664faaabf_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>9. Now You Can Actually Read It</strong></span></p>
<p>Below is a readable photo of the text and you can see the content of the missing section. This section tells of a theoretical conversation between the students of Jesus and the rabbis. The tale incriminates the rabbis as the killers of Jesus and these students. The conversation is fascinating on its own but of more interest to us right now is the resolution to the mystery of Sanhedrin 43A. This section was removed at some point between 1549 and 1859. Either printers that were censored by the church removed the text or the rabbis had it removed to protect themselves from the ire of the church. In either case, it left many generations of Talmudic scholars in the dark.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082143_4f02739c22_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7162" alt="IMG_1547" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082143_4f02739c22_o-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>10. Jesus Was Hanged On Passover Eve According to These Rabbis</strong></span></p>
<p>Below you can clearly see some of the text: &#8220;On Erev Pesach they hanged him&#8221;, &#8220;He tricked and misled Israel&#8221;. This is not a reliable proof that the rabbis killed Jesus. It is not meant to be historical as it is an <em>aggadic</em> text. Further, I believe some of the facts of the story here are actually impossible to reconcile with each other</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082405_2ca444cc2b_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7161" alt="IMG_1548" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082405_2ca444cc2b_o-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>Mystery solved! The old editions of the Talmud tell us the story of Sanhedrin 43A. Of course, this mystery has not been solved by me, this stuff is pretty well known and available in other formats. I just think it is even more amazing to see it in action. Now you have seen the evidence.</p>

<p>Here are a couple photos of the PJC Mishloach Manos and the accompanying poem. Special thanks to my wife Tova for designing the Mishloach Manos and all the helpers who put the bags together. Enjoy!<span id="more-5253"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0673.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5254 aligncenter" title="IMG_0673" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0673-e1331227711953-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">From time to time, people like to take a trip to the beach<br />
They go as far as they can, until the shore they reach</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Everyone takes a bag when they go on a little trip<br />
Whether going for some sun or a little dip</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our Pacific Jewish Center bag is packed for a picnic lunch<br />
With lots of goodies to snack on and things to munch</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We are the famous Shul on the Beach, with a unique position<br />
Helping us spread the light of Hashem’s Torah is our mission</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thousands walk by our shul searching for something, every week<br />
For the special ones who join us, it is inspiration they seek</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But everyone lbenefits from the shul’s presence as a reminder<br />
That as lost as someone might be, there is also always a Finder</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We elevate the boardwalk from pure materialism to something higher<br />
It is a model of Kiddush Hashem and our power to inspire</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Just like the Purim story takes a tale of seemingly coincidence and chance<br />
And transforms it to a joyous and spiritual holiday of love, friendship, song, and dance</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By our acts and commitment we transform the spiritual wasteland outside<br />
The good must be victorious when spiritual and material worlds collide</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Similarly we transform simple picnic foods like meat, condiments, and beer<br />
Into a holy mitzvah that lifts spirits and brings good cheer</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Let’s take this Purim lesson and continue to teach the world its truth<br />
It shall be known everywhere, take this world and make it holy, every adult and every youth</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Happy Purim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>From your friends at Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach</em></p>

<p>One of the starkest differences between orthodox Jews and others can be observed at a wedding. The orthodox Jewish wedding is really two weddings. One for the men and one for women. They are in the same place but in today&#8217;s society, they eat and dance while completely separated. It can seem strange. But in another sense it can be quite beautiful.</p>
<p>The beauty comes from seeing a large gathering of people, usually orthodox Jewish wedding parties are attended by several hundred people, all joined together for one holy purpose. Marriage is a very important milestone in orthodox Judaism and the awe, reverence, and respect according the event creates a very special atmosphere.</p>
<p>The unity of the event can also be seen superficially by the uniform standards of dress. Everyone dresses conservatively and they kind of blend together. When one pulls back, it can be visually stunning. Especially to an outsider.</p>
<p>An outsider had a unique opportunity to photograph a superstar wedding in Israel. Oded Balilty is a Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist. He lives right around Bnei Brak but his world is very different. Take a look at his perspective from behind the lens of this world that is closer to his own than he realizes. The photos are on the NY Times website today and they are amazing. His commentary is excellent as well.</p>
<p>Check out the photos on the NY Times Lens Blog: <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/so-close-yet-so-far/" target="_blank">So Close, Yet So Far</a></p>

The party featured delicious Chanukah foods and treats, dreidel contests, a moon bounce for the kids, entertainment for everyone courtesy of Derek the Mime a speech from the rabbi and most of all, lovely company.</p>
<p>As usual, the party was open to the Pacific Jewish Center community and to the public as part of our Outreach on the Beach programming. The community was well represented with an excellent showing at the party. With our doors wide open at on Venice Boardwalk we also met and made many old and new friends. People who had been in the shul before returned this afternoon. One woman had been in the shul in the 50&#8242;s and had not been back since. Others were old friends who were part of our community for many years before moving on. It was so nice to see them all. We also met many new people. Some were local Jewish residents who had just never had a chance to come to shul and others were travelers and tourists, some Jewish and some not at all.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful afternoon. We thank everyone who came and who contributed to the festive and celebratory atmosphere.</p>

He asked if he could take pictures of us at The Shul on the Beach.</p>
<p>Normally, there is not much to photograph on weekdays and we would not be comfortable with someone taking pictures. Last time we had photographers in our shul it was Purim. It was an interesting time to take pictures but hardly a &#8220;typical day&#8221; in the life of an orthodox Jew. But it does make for a spectacular presentation. If you have not already seen it &#8211; please check that out over here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/19/pacific-jewish-center-featured-on-msnbc-com/">Pacific Jewish Center Featured on MSNBC.com</a></p>
<p>I told the caller that the only chance I thought he had of photographing something worthwhile would be Hoshana Rabbah, the next day, at 7 AM. I told him about the Four Species and the circuits around the Bima. He said he would be there. We had a date.</p>
<p>Below you will see a slideshow of some of the photos he took at The Shul on the Beach that morning. The photography is outstanding and really captures the services. I hope Jason&#8217;s documentary is a success and appreciate the time and effort he put into these photos. We also really appreciate his sharing them with us.</p>
<p>Thank you Jason!</p>
<p>Enjoy.<span id="more-4764"></span></p>

<p>The series depicts average people from all walks of life absorbed in their phones. They seem oblivious to their surroundings despite being photographed in some of the most spectacular spots in New York. The photos capture in living color the nature of phone focus. The photographs are so sharply focused on their subjects and the backgrounds are mostly out of focus that they subliminally tell the story of self focus.</p>
<p>The phenomena is widespread and I can&#8217;t pretend that I am not one who this may happen to from time to time.</p>
<p>Seeing the shots of these people makes me not want to be one of them anymore.</p>
<p>To me, the message of the series is that<span id="more-4398"></span> we should try to refocus on the beautiful real world while we can. Put the phone down for a few minutes. Enjoy the fresh air and sights, scenes and colors of our surroundings. (Almost) Nothing is <em>that</em> important. We need to try to pull ourselves out of the digital world as much as we can.</p>
<p>One minor quibble I have with the series is that title: Texters. Texting is one thing people do on their phones. But one can be just as busy and unaware by surfing the web, playing a game, reading blogs or whatever. Texting is a bit too limiting of a title for my taste.</p>
<p>Also, check out the Chasidic Jew on his decidedly non-kosher phone!</p>

<p></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Here’s another post about my recent trip to Israel: (Read the previous two posts in the series here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/23/a-jerusalem-wedding/">A Jerusalem Wedding</a> and  <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/29/the-zilberman-home-a-thriving-jewish-family-in-the-arab-quarter-of-jerusalem/">The Zilberman Home: A Thriving Jewish Family in the Arab Quarter of Jerusalem</a>)</em></p>
<p>One of my favorite places in the world is the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem. The stones are soaked in history and the roads filled with Jews and non-Jews of all kinds seeking to hear what the Old City has to say.</p>
<p>A landmark of the Jewish Quarter was the Churva synagogue ruins. A majestic arch was all that remained of a beautiful synagogue in the Jewish Quarter square. That landmark has now been supplanted by a far more majestic one. The rebuilt synagogue dominates the Cardo / Square area. I was given a tour and some history that I would like to share with you.<span id="more-4064"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_4077" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 569px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110502.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4077 " title="P1110502" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110502-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="559" height="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;The Churva Synagogue&quot;</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">The original synagogue on this plot was built in the early 18th century by students of R&#8217; Yehuda HaChassid who settled in Jerusalem. In order to build the synagogue the builders borrowed a hefty sum from the local Ottoman Arabs. When they fell significantly into arrears, the lenders had the synagogue razed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For over 140 years the synagogue lay in ruin and became known as the Churva, &#8220;Destroyed&#8221;. In the late 19th century, students of the Vilna Gaon rebuilt the synagogue and it flourished again as the main synagogue for the Jews living in the Old City. It became an international symbol of Jewish pride and the center for Jewish religious life in Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the 1948 war for Independence, the synagogue was razed once again by Arabs. This time, not for a debt, rather for vengeance. After the war, the Old City remained under Arab control and the synagogue remained a pile of rubble.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 1967, Israel regained control over the area. The Churva shul was a priority and it was hoped that it would be rebuilt quickly. Ten years later, with no progress to speak of, the city built a commemorative arch to be a placeholder until the synagogue was rebuilt in earnest. This is the familiar arch that most visitors to the Old City will recall over the last 30 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, about 5 years ago, construction commenced and was recently completed. The result is a magnificent building which retains many of the same elements as the two original structures. The outside view is beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_4082" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hurva_Synagogue_1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4082 " title="Hurva Synagogue, Jerusalem - IsraÃ«l" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hurva_Synagogue_1.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="524" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From the outside</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Inside, takes it a whole new level. I felt like I was in the most beautiful shul I had ever been to. Once you get inside, the building takes on the familiar mode of many older synagogues with a main sanctuary on the ground level and balconies for women. The bima is in the middle of the sanctuary.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align: left;">
<dl id="attachment_4066" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110514.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4066 " title="P1110514" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110514-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">View of the Bima from the front of the shul</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The artwork throughout the building is beautiful. There are paintings above the entrance as you can see above. There is stained glass all around the shul. The stone work and moldings are exquisite. But most of all, I loved the paintings in the ceiling corners.</p>
<div id="attachment_4072" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110508.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4072 " title="P1110508" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110508-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tomb of the Patriarchs</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4071" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110509.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4071 " title="P1110509" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110509-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tomb of Rachel</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4070" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110510.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4070" title="P1110510" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110510-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View of Tiberias</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4069" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110511.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4069" title="P1110511" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110511-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David&#39;s Citadel</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">The ark is stunning as well. It looks like there are two arks but really there is just one. How would they use the top one!?  The bottom ark is the functional ark. The Torah scrolls are stored in there. The top section is not an ark at all. It just looks nice.</p>
<div id="attachment_4073" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110507.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4073" title="P1110507" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1110507-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The ark</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see, the synagogue is stunning. If you look carefully you can see the wall is made of two shades of stone. I believe, the darker stone is original stone from the ruins and the lighter stone is the new stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, greater than the physical beauty of the shul is the symbolism of the shul. Its original builders were chasidic mystics risked everything to come to Jerusalem in an attempt to hasten the coming of the Messiah. The next builders were vehement opponents of the chasidic movement. The most recent builders was the government of Israel. Now, the shul is maintained by the Zilberman family of the Old City. Four groups of Jews that may not share all that much in common. But the shul connects them all.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Isn&#8217;t that one of the points of a shul? To build community? To connect people who would otherwise be disconnected? From Judaism? Or even just from each other?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think it is. That is why I am proud to represent the Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach. Our shul also connects all sorts of people. Our shul is also a common thread among diverse people. The Churva shul is a model for us and others. I hope more shuls can take this model and implement it in their communities in the hope that we can foster unity among our people.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Taking it one step further, the Churva shul has been destroyed twice. And rebuilt twice as well. Our Temple was destroyed twice but only rebuilt (from scratch) once so far. We hope and pray that the Third Temple will be rebuilt speedily in our days.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, in our lives we too can feel destroyed sometimes. Look to the Churva shul for inspiration and hopefully we can rebuild ourselves as beautifully as the Churva shul has been rebuilt.</p>

<p>For many religious people, the most important city in the world is Jerusalem. In the early days of the city, after King David purchased the Temple Mount and the First Temple was built by his son King Solomon the city of Jerusalem was not where the &#8220;Old City&#8221; is today. It was on the opposite side of the Temple Mount. The &#8220;Old City&#8221; is a much newer city probably around 500 years old. It&#8217;s possible that people inhabited the area currently known as the Old City as early as the late Second Temple period, but it wasn&#8217;t formally fortified with the walls in their current position until about 500 years ago.</p>
<p>The Old City is rich in religious significance and religion. The Western Wall, the holiest site for Jews, is in the Old City as are the Dome of Rock and Al Aqsa Mosque, two of the most important holy places for Muslims. Additionally, Christians place special significance on several places in the Old City including the  Church of the Holy Sepulchre.<span id="more-4011"></span></p>
<p>The Old City is divided into &#8220;Quarters&#8221;. The Quarters are not a quarter a piece. They are randomly shaped and sized. The smallest quarter is the Armenian and the second smallest quarter is the Jewish Quarter. The largest quarter is the Arab Quarter. Very few Jews live in the Arab Quarter. (Now, there are more than there had been for quite some time.) One of the more well known Jewish residents of the Arab Quarter is a family named Zilberman. They are also famous for their famed (and perhaps slightly controversial) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilberman_Method" target="_blank">Torah academy for boys</a>.</p>
<p>It happens that a cousin of my wife married a Zilberman. But not one of the children of the residents of the Arab Quarter. That is his uncle.</p>
<p>He offered to take us to his uncle&#8217;s house and show us around. We immediately took him up on the offer.</p>
<p>The Zilbermans live pretty deep into the Arab Quarter. We walked through the Arab Shuk (market) and then up and around a few streets that I had never been on before despite my many trips to Jerusalem. I had never been through the main thoroughfares of the Arab Quarter before.</p>
<p>We arrived at their home.</p>
<div id="attachment_4013" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110550.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4013" title="P1110550" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110550.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In Hebrew: Zilberman</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Their home is neighbored on one side by a Muslim family and on the other by a Christian family. The three of them get along well. They share a cup of coffee (literal, not figurative) every so often.</p>
<p>The first thing that was pointed out to us as we entered the home was something in the threshold. It was a nook for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezuzah" target="_blank">mezuza</a>. The nook is carved out of the wall so that a mezuza can be placed near the door. It is nearly impossible to affix a mezuza to stone so the nook is necessary. Interestingly enough, the nook was there when the Zilbermans bought the home about 10 years ago. This means that is was either built for Jewish inhabitants when it was first constructed or sometime along the way a Jewish family lived there. That was very interesting to me.</p>
<div id="attachment_4014" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110551.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4014" title="P1110551" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110551.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The nook for the mezuza is in the center</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">We went through the doorway and saw the entrance-way to the home. It is a very narrow house with at least 3 stories. The bottom level is the dining room. The room was full of garbage when they bought the home. They cleared it out and removed all the rubble and created a beautiful new space. The Zilbermans host a huge Shabbos meal (just about) every week. Their entertaining room is used as a place to welcome hundreds and hundreds of guests into their home every Shabbos. The room is beautiful.</p>
<div id="attachment_4015" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110529.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4015" title="P1110529" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110529.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Zilbermans dining room</p></div>
<p>The real treat of the home is the balcony. The Zilbermans have several balconies. The uppermost balcony has a view that most Jewish people don&#8217;t get to experience. The Zilberman&#8217;s home is much further north than any other Jewish homes so that the view of the Temple Mount is more straight away as opposed to on an angle. From the balcony there is a clear view of the Temple Mount square. The stone tiling on the floor of the Temple Mount is a rare sight for Jews seeing as we are prohibited from approaching the Temple Mount by Jewish law and the views from the Jewish Quarter don&#8217;t quite get the right angle. Here is the view looking a bit south from the Zilberman&#8217;s balcony. If you look carefully to the left of the photo you can make out some of the Temple Mount floor.</p>
<div id="attachment_4016" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110537.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4016" title="P1110537" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110537.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View from the Zilberman&#39;s balcony</p></div>
<p>After we took some photos from the balcony we went back down to the dining room for some group photos and to ask a few more questions. Down there we also saw a very old cistern in the dining room bathroom. They also have an album of the construction of their home while they were living there. It was a very ambitious project and it turned out really well. I also got to take a photo with my wife&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s husband (a Zilberman) and just writing that, makes me realize how fortunate I am to have such wonderful family to share experiences and learn from.</p>
<div id="attachment_4017" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110549.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4017" title="P1110549" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110549.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me and my wife&#39;s cousin&#39;s husband (it was cold and rainy - hence the sweater and coat)</p></div>
<p>Before we left I just had to ask how their relationship was with their non-Jewish neighbors. The answer was that they got along really well. As I mentioned above, they have coffee together every now and again. They consider their non-Jewish neighbors their friends. I asked what happens between them when there is tension or even terror attacks. I was told that their relationship is unaffected by the actions and rhetoric of others. They have mutual respect for one another and what happens politically or militarily is not of very important consequence between friends. I have to say, I was impressed with that approach and it mirrors my personal experiences as well.</p>
<p>The Zilbermans believe that they are doing good work by making a kiddush Hashem in an area that is generally devoid of Jewish influence and spirituality. They are doing a great job at that. I believe that they are a wonderful example of devotion to religion and tolerance.</p>
<p>We all can learn from them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite unccoperative weather, Purim at the Shul on the Beach was enjoyed by all. As a community we performed all the mitzvos of the day.</p>
<p>Beginning with the packing of Mishloach Manos on the Fast of Esther we spent time together celebrating one of the joyous periods of the Jewish calendar. The packing event was a success. Firstly because the Mishloach Manos got packed. But more importantly, those who attended connected to each other through a mitzva and that is a special connection. I need to thank my wife <strong>Tova</strong> for designing, ordering and creating the entire custom Mishloach Manos as well as organizing and compiling the PJC Yam Yam Salad Cookbook that was printed and included in every Mishloach Manos package.</p>
<p>After Shabbos we collected Matanos L&#8217;evyonim and heard the megilla read beautifully by <strong>Hillel Philip</strong> while many were dressed in their Purim costumes. He did an excellent job and we celebrated with Hamentashen after the reading. During Purim day, the Mishloach Manos were delivered by PJC volunteers spearheaded by <strong>Alan Danziger</strong> with the assistance of <strong>Leslie Friedman</strong>. It wasn&#8217;t easy to do in the rain, but all the packages were delivered. In the afternoon we had a party for the community which was deliciously catered by <strong>Mr. Pickles </strong>and organized by <strong>Jeff Liss</strong> with some assistance by <strong>Frederic Eger</strong>. It was a lot of fun to celebrate the joy of Purim together. If not for the inclement weather I am sure many more neighobrs and passers-by on the boardwalk would have joined us. But it was pouring rain and the boardwalk was deserted.</p>
<p>They missed and we enjoyed a great show by Alula. We danced, sang, ate and reveled through the afternoon. Purim at the Shul on the Beach was a wonderful kiddush Hashem and we hope next year we will be blessed with better weather and some more guests from outside the community.</p>
<p>Enjoy the photos of the packing and party below:</p>

<p>There are a few seminal events that are rare, exhilarating and emotional in the life of a Rabbi. One of those events is the dedication of a new Torah scroll. And yesterday I was fortunate to be a part of a wonderful Torah Dedication ceremony and celebration.</p>
<p><strong>Randy</strong> and <strong>Deeana Frankel</strong> are celebrating the Bnei Mitzvah of their son <strong>Zev</strong> and their daughter <strong>Ariella</strong>. They chose to commemorate this milestone by restoring a Torah scroll rescued from the Holocaust. During a small, intimate ceremony, that Torah scroll has been placed in the Ark at the Shul on the Beach and we could not be more proud.</p>
<p>The ceremony was the typical Torah dedication with one small exception. The standard procession took place on the Venice Boardwalk.<span id="more-3467"></span> Hundreds of people stopped to watch, photograph, record video and enjoy the celebration. It was clearly inspirational for many of the observers to see such excitement and honor given to the Torah. It was a real kiddush Hashem.</p>
<p>We danced on the boardwalk with the Torah for a little while then proceeded into the Shul where we placed the Torah in its new home in the Ark. Following the ceremony we enjoyed a lovely catered lunch. During the lunch Randy spoke for a few minutes. I also addressed the guests for a few minutes and you can hear both speeches by clicking the play button below.</p>
<p>This morning, we used the Torah for the first time as we read from the Torah as part of morning services. It was very powerful to call Randy to the Torah to make the blessing on the Torah using his very own Torah.</p>
<p>The event was very inspirational for me and something I will never forget. Not all rabbis are lucky enough to participate in a Torah dedication ceremony and I thank the Frankels for making me a lucky rabbi!</p>
<p>I had a few photos taken of the procession. The Frankels had a professional photographer who can certainly put these photos to shame but the celebration was so special and so unique that I wanted to share these photos with everyone.</p>

<p>As the ambassadors of Judaism on the Venice Beach boardwalk, we are charged with the resonsibility and opportunity to provide a Jewish experience to the myriad of Jews and non-Jews who pass our shul on a daily basis.</p>
<p>To that end, we provided an open house Chanukah party. Many passers-by came inside to partake in the spiritual and physical warmth of our shul and its members. Our community made a kiddush Hashem and I am proud of our Chanukah party.</p>
<p>Special kudos<span id="more-3430"></span> are in order for <strong>Jeff Liss</strong> who organized the entire shebang and to <strong>Rabbi Mintz</strong> for manning the doors of the Shul and inviting anyone who was interested into the shul. Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Josh Blum</strong> snatched my camera as soon as I walked into the shul. The pictures that tell the story of our Chanukah party are his and we appreciate his talents (as well as being an integral member of the community) thanks Josh!</p>
<p>I also want to thank everyone who came to the party and participated in the festivities. Your presence was noted and appreciated.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that we are also lighting the Menorah on 3rd Street Promenade Tomorrow night. See you there!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4940039507_f479ee509d.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2778" title="Pacific Jewish Center The Shul on the Beach" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4940039507_f479ee509d-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>At Pacific Jewish Center we endeavor to share the light Judaism with the entire Beach Community. As we approach the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana, the least we could do was wish the Venice Boardwalk a collective Shana Tova (A Good Year) to all the passersby.</p>
<p>So I set up shop outside the Shul on the Beach on a Sunday afternoon. Literally thousands of people pass the Shul on a beautiful summer Sunday like yesterday. I started all alone, but was eventually joined by Shul Co-President Alan Danziger and veteran of the Venice Boardwalk outreach scene, Rabbi Mintz and as the Klezmer Concert approached (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/30/klezmer-on-the-beach-concert-was-a-great-success/">Klezmer on the Beach Concert Was a Great Success</a>) many, many friends, neighbors and my family. Over the course of the few hours we were there plenty of folks from the local area and as far as Australia, London, Israel (of course) and South Africa stopped by.<span id="more-2777"></span></p>
<p>Everyone was offered some apples and honey to symbolize our wish for a sweet new year and many obliged. We also gave tours of our shul and some even took advantage of the photo opportunity to take one with a rabbi (me). No doubt to show their parents back home &#8220;See I am hanging out with a rabbi in a shul!&#8221;. Of course we also invited them all to come again on the High Holidays if they needed a place to go and even to stop by on a Shabbos for a few moments any time they please.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will be there again this coming Sunday of Labor Day weekend to meet more people and dip even more apples into honey.</p>
<p>We look forward to more events open to the public and much more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

We are the custodians of the Shul on the Beach and any chance we have to share the Shul with the public we should!</p>
<p>This year we have had public events on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-photos/" target="_blank">Chanukah</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/15/mishloach-manos-packing-on-the-beach-21410/" target="_blank">Pre-Purim</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/" target="_blank">Purim</a>. We also had several Sundays where we just hang out at the shul welcoming visitors.</p>
<p>Because Sunday was also an Erev Yom Tov (and people are making preparations for the holiday) we did not have a public event for Pesach (stay tuned &#8217;til Sukkos). But I felt it would be wrong not to open the shul doors for at least a little while so I went to the Shul for a couple hours on Sunday.<span id="more-2334"></span></p>
<p>My sister in law came over with Rami and Ozzie and kept and I on them while I gave out Matza and talked to anyone interested in hanging out for a few minutes. I met some very interesting people and took just a few photos which you can enjoy below.</p>
<p>It was a great compliment to a holiday that featured a lot of outreach as some community members hosted Seders for friends and neighbors. One seder had 58! guests and another had well over 30, while others hosted a smaller more intimate groups! I was very impressed with the commitment of those community members to sharing our wonderful traditions with those who may not be so familiar with Pesach and the seder. All I can say is <em>Thank You</em> and <em>Great Job</em>!</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that I took some time to meet and greet people at the Shul on the Beach. We look forward to more events open to the public and more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

<p>This Purim, The Shul On The Beach opened its doors to the entire Venice / Santa Monica community to join in a Purim Celebration. An excellent turnout from our members, friends and neighbors set the stage for a truly memorable afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Beithalachmi prepared a wonderful Purim feast that was partially sponsored by Yossi and Joannie Ziff on the occasion of their second anniversary. As always, Jeff Liss planned an excellent party, including first class entertainment (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/28/alula-performs-at-pacific-jewish-center-purim-party-in-venice/" target="_blank">see the previous post</a>), refreshments and a costume contest. Most importantly, our community really stepped up to the plate in terms of hospitality, friendliness and warmth. Led, once again, by Rabbi Mintz, many, many guests were ushered into the Shul.<span id="more-2185"></span></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting neighbors who had simply never dropped by the Shul, Israelis on vacation, random folks on Venice Boardwalk who wanted to stop in, children, elderly people, Jews, non-Jews, religious and otherwise. We tried to take photos with as many people as possible and you can check out the slideshow of photos below. [If you have any photos to add, PLEASE email them to me and I will add them!]
<p>Guests enjoyed hamentaschen, the lively music and touring our Shul. As always, we enjoyed meeting so many people from so many different backgrounds and situations and sharing the joy of Purim with them.</p>
<p>There was a small contingency from the press (MSNBC.com) that joined us throughout Purim. They were at the reading of the Scroll of Esther on Purim evening and returned for the today&#8217;s celebration. It was so much fun getting to know them and sharing our Purim with them. We look forward to seeing the fruits of their labor sometime in April. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
<p>The gathering was lively and inspiring. I spoke briefly about the meaning of our commandment to remember Amalek. Amalek attacked the Jewish people just after the Exodus from Egypt. They focused their attack on the stragglers. I expressed my hope that as a community we would not allow any stragglers. We must be inclusive and help everyone to feel that they are in the center of the group. There can be no fringe group if we are to &#8220;defeat&#8221; Amalek. Today&#8217;s event was a strong step in that direction.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to all of you who helped and joined and made the event the festive celebration it was.</p>
<p>We are planning more events of this nature in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a great day for Pacific Jewish Center and our community.</p>
<p>A little while back, we decided that it would a lot of fun for the community to get together and pack mishloach manos together at the Shul on the Beach.</p>
<p>The event had a triple purpose. The goals were all met and exceeded. The first goal was to make a more creative mishloach manos that effectively reflected the spirit of the Shul on the Beach<span id="more-2149"></span> as opposed to using &#8220;canned&#8221; mimshloach manos from a vendor. The second goal was to have fun together as a community and use our creative talents in a productive way. The third was to invite the entire beach community to see our shul and invite them inside to see the shul and inform them about future events, like our upcoming Purim Celebration, as well as weekly services. This would be part of our Outreach on the Beach initiative.</p>
<p>Well, the mishloach manos are all packed. So we accomplished that goal.</p>
<p>A lot of community came to help and hang out and they all had a lot of fun. So we accomplished that goal.</p>
<p>And plenty of beach goers, dog walkers, tourists, neighbors and interesting people came to visit our shul and promised to return for a future event or services! Once again, we accomplished our goal. Some visitors even helped with the mishloach manos packing! Thanks!</p>
<p>It would be nice to mention everyone who came by name, but I know I would leave people out. So if you were there, maybe you&#8217;ll see a photo of yourself in the slideshow below. Leave a comment and tell us if you helped out!</p>
<p>The only person I will mention by name is my wife Tova. Tova organized the entire project and spent hours and hours choosing the items for the mishloach manos, finding the best vendors to purchase from, reordering when things got lost in transit or were out of stock 3 days before the event and of course designing the innovative looking mishloach manos packages. Thank you Tova!</p>
<p>Here is the slideshow. Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left; "><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1565 alignleft" title="Venice 1910" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winwardc10a-150x150.jpg" alt="Venice 1910" width="150" height="150" />The <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> Shul on the Beach has hosted many, many guest. Jews and non-Jews from all over the world have come through its doors marveling at its charm and aura.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">This morning the Pacific Jewish Center hosted a special group of visitors. Friend of the Shul, Harry Medved is an active member of the <a href="http://www.venicehistorical.org/" target="_blank">Venice Historical Society</a>. Today, the Venice Historical Society arranged a walking tour of Venice with a focus on landmarks and locations used in movies and Television.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">The tour made a stop at the Shul on the Beach.<span id="more-1560"></span>This is our shul sporting a new, classic Venice paint job.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1561" title="Pacific Jewish Center Shul on the Beach" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_032811.jpg" alt="Pacific Jewish Center Shul on the Beach" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
<p style="text-align: left; ">
<p style="text-align: left; ">
<p style="text-align: left; ">
<p style="text-align: left; ">Once at the shul, I welcomed the group into the sanctuary where Harry told the attendees of some of the cinematographic significance of the shul.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">I added my 2 cents to the discussion. We got a notice that NCIS LA is filming in front of the shul on Tuesday and that I was able to see the front entrance canopy in the movie &#8220;I Love You, Man&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1563" title="Venice Historical Society Inside the Pacific Jewish Center" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_0334.jpg" alt="Venice Historical Society Inside the Pacific Jewish Center" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Then I addressed the crowd. I spoke briefly about the importance of the Shul on the Beach. A landmark that is passed by thousands of people every month has an impact on those who see it. Even if the only benefit the shul provided was that the passers-by reflected on their lives for a second, it would be an important place.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">But there is so much more than just the brick and mortar of the shul. There is a vibrant community, weekly services, acts of loving-kindness, Torah classes and much more in our shul. I thanked everyone for visiting and invited them back to see us again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">We wrapped up this part of the tour with a group photograph in front of the shul. It came out really nice. (Thanks to my wife Tova for snapping the picture and thanks Leslie Friedman for giving me a hand welcoming the Venice Historical Society.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left; "><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1564" title="IMG_0336" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_0336.jpg" alt="IMG_0336" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Harry Medved is in the center wearing a blue shirt. See if you can spot the Rabbi&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">It&#8217;s like that awesome game &#8220;Where&#8217;s Waldo&#8221;!</p>
