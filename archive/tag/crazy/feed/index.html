				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/murder_mystery-puzzle.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6155" title="murder_mystery-puzzle" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/murder_mystery-puzzle-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>This summer has been a particularly violent summer in the USA. At least to my mind, there have been more reported acts of politicized public violence and mayhem than usual.</p>
<p>Aurora, the Sikh Temple, Texas A&amp;M, and now the Family Research Council, are all very public examples of gunmen and violence.</p>
<p>As with everything in life, there are many prisms with which to view this violence and its social ramifications. I have taken an interest in the reactions after the shootings. It seems that the most important thing to establish is whether the gunman was liberal or conservative. The next thing to do is to show how liberalism or conservatism is the reason that the gunmen killed innocent people. The next step is to proclaim the ideology of the gunmen an ideology of violence and barbarism.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see this from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a similar exercise in futilty in debates between believers and non-believers. That argument usually follows the very logical path of analysis that attributes historical and contemporary violence to fervent religious beliefs. Events like the Inquisition, Crusades, and  violence associated with Jihad are favorite examples used to prove this point.</p>
<p>In my opinion, all of these analyses are extremely superficial and contain numerous fallacies.<span id="more-6154"></span></p>
<p>Systematic killing is not a relevant discussion to sporadic violence. There is a systematic killing in some places in the world. It so happens that those places are third world countries that do not value life in the same way more civilized countries value life. So comparing militants in the Sudan to a shooter at the FRC in DC is a complete non-sequitur. Violent outbursts in modern society are not the same kind of killings as systematic killings which were mostly done for the sake of power or position and they leveraged religion to accomplish those goals. But that is not our concern. It does not tell us anything about violent martyrs who kill for a cause expecting to die.</p>
<p>The reason people kill other people is very complex. There are many factors that contribute to a human being taking the life of another. Certainly one needs motivation and political position or religious beliefs may provide motivation. But at its core, taking the life of another is an extremely anti-social behavior. It takes a specific kind of person to kill another, even for the sake of one&#8217;s beliefs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that an ideology can transform a normal functioning person into a sociopathic killer. The gap between &#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;murderer&#8221; is far too wide a gap to be crossed by adding <em>only</em> ideology. Further, let&#8217;s assume that less than .0001% of society murders other people. Meaning, for argument&#8217;s sake, one out of every one million people is a murderer. Personally, I think that is high, but let&#8217;s go with it. If religion or a specific political stance is so evil it causes murder, it is extremely ineffective at doing so. In other words, with so few murderers in society, it seems improbable to blame something as common as religion or political beliefs for murder.</p>
<p>Sure, many murderers hold extreme positions. But that is not what caused them to murder. Rather, the same thing that draws them to extremism is the thing that allows them to act in such an anti-social manner. To put it bluntly, people who kill other people are crazy. That is the starting point. Do crazy people believe in crazy things? Absolutely. But their beliefs are not what makes them crazy. Their beliefs are a symptom of their craziness, just as murder is a symptom of their craziness.</p>
<p>If there was no religion and if there were no politics, crazy people would still exist. And crazy people with access, opportunity, and motivation will sometimes kill other people.</p>
<p>So do me a favor. Please. Stop telling me about murderers who were socialists or liberals or libertarians or social conservatives or Christians, or Muslims, or Atheists, or Whatever. That is not relevant to their heinous murderous ways. People from all walks of life with all kinds of beliefs have been known to kill other people. More extreme groups will have more extreme people who have murderous tendencies. The beliefs don&#8217;t make them crazy, their craziness draws them to the beliefs.</p>
<p>The important thing that we should analyze about murderers is their mental health. We don&#8217;t need to eliminate religion or politics to stop murder in modern society, we need to deal with mental illness more aggressively and more effectively.</p>

<p>The reason? The store refused to write the child&#8217;s name on the cake.</p>
<p>That child&#8217;s name? Adolph Hitler Campbell. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/17/adolf-hitler-campbell-cant-get-a-birthday-cake/">Adolf Hitler Campbell can&#8217;t get a birthday cake</a>)</p>
<p>A little while later, I reported that the child, along with his siblings were taken into protective services. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/14/breaking-news-adlf-hitlr-campbell-update/">Breaking News! Ad@lf Hitl&amp;r Campbell Update</a>)</p>
<p>Following an appeal, Heath Campbell (the father) has lost custody of his children.<span id="more-2703"></span></p>
<p>The ruling is not based upon the names of the children: Adolf Hitler Campbell, 4, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell, 3, and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie Campbell, 2. Rather, it seems Mr. Campbell has a bit of a mean streak. In a shocking development it was discovered that Heath Campbell used excessive violence and threats of violence against his children and his wife.</p>
<p>It is sad that these kids will grow up with the most offensive names in the world and now, without a father. But I suppose it is for their best&#8230;</p>
<p>And as a lesson to all of us, always treat your kids right, and that starts with naming them with a proper name.</p>
<p>(And a lesson to others, if you are too violent, depraved or moronic to procreate &#8211; DON&#8217;T! Thanks.)</p>

<p>Sometimes there is just not much to write and that&#8217;s every bloggers worst nightmare. I had a few things that were on my mind that I wished to share but none of those ideas fermented into anything worth posting.</p>
<p>I love blogging and I think it is important to supply fresh content as often as possible. It is no fun to see the same posts every day. I needed something new.</p>
<p>Then I went outside and I found what is perhaps the most disturbing flyer I have ever seen attached to my car.<span id="more-1163"></span></p>
<p>Before my blogging days, I may have been annoyed with the person who stuck the flyer to my windsheield. But not this day. This flyer was so outrageous that I felt I must share it with you.</p>
<p>I present you with &#8220;alibisnpaybacks&#8221;.</p>
