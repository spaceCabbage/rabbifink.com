				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7128" alt="alaska-erosion-photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" /></a>The fallout over the Doheny Kosher meat scandal continues. This week, the Jewish Journal reported that three kosher restaurants have dropped the RCC Hechsher in favor of alternative hechshers.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing. RCC is not as good for the bottom line as the other hechshers. The only real reason a restaurant will switch is to increase business. It seems that RCC businesses are suffering. I have some first hand information from vendors that this is the case as well.</p>
<p>It goes even further. Shiloh&#8217;s Restaurant has a splash page of their website that assures customers that they are and always have been using Kehilla for their hechsher and not RCC. The note distances Shiloh&#8217;s from Doheny Kosher Meat as well. See the note here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gUiNl0R.png" target="_blank">Shiloh&#8217;s</a></p>
<p>All this can only mean one thing. A significant number of people have been spooked by the kashrus scandal. It goes so far that people need to be reassured that a kosher restaurant did not purchase any meat from Doheny.<span id="more-7127"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. The halachic authority who was counseled on this case and is a senior <em>posek</em> for the OU already said that there was no halachic problem for consumers or restaurants who bought from Doheny. The RCC has admitted there were issues and they are fixing them. Some of the restaurants that switched don&#8217;t even sell meat!</p>
<p>The point here is that people are basically ignoring the halachic psak given in this case. Who are these people? Are they <em>frummer</em> than halacha? Why would anyone be concerned if a restaurant got meat from Doheny? The psak is that there is no problem if one bought meat from Doheny? What are they worried about?</p>
<p>The funny thing is that people will harp on Daas Torah for every <em>chumra</em> or <em>hashkafic</em> nuance as long as it looks more frum. But the second Daas Torah says something is permissible those same people become independent thinkers who don&#8217;t rely on Daas Torah.</p>
<p>On the one hand I see this as an erosion of Daas Torah. Some might see that as a positive development. Some might see that as a negative development. Either way, it seems that people are not buying into Daas Torah completely. It&#8217;s only when it suits my <em>chumra</em> lifestyle or to marginalize others that I will listen to Daas Torah they say. On the other hand not trusting RCC (especially for dairy!) after a <em>psak</em> that says there is nothing to worry about from a halachic perspective, is a huge problem. If we do not rely on our <em>poskim</em> for <em>heter</em> we are in big trouble. I do not like the direction this is heading. We must be able to rely on <em>psak halacha, </em>especially when the halacha is lenient.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nate-silver-hed-2012.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6433" title="nate-silver-hed-2012" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nate-silver-hed-2012-300x168.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>The election is over. Just over half of the country is happy with the results of the election. Just under half of the country is disappointed with the results of the election. No matter who won, some people would be happy and others would be sad. That&#8217;s just the reality of politics in America today.</p>
<p>However, there is one aspect of the election that should make everyone happy. By everyone, I mean whether you were rooting for Obama or Romney, you have the right to celebrate something.</p>
<p>Everyone should be celebrating with Nate Silver and <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight</a>.</p>
<p>To recap: Nate Silver confidently projected the outcome of the election nearly perfectly. This is not the first time he has done this. Silver has been blisteringly accurate in the two elections he has predicted. He came to politics by route of math and statistics, not policy and analysis. He was perfect last night as well.</p>
<p>While I am thrilled for Silver because he vindicated himself against the doubters (and the homophobes), I think his victory is a victory for all of us.<span id="more-6432"></span></p>
<p>Silver got his start in analyzing baseball statistics using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics" target="_blank">sabermetrics</a>. He sold his model to the premier sabermetrics website and then moved to politics. His methodologies leave very little room for chance and are based on hard mathematical analysis. Silver removes subjectivity and does not rely on logical fallacies in his projections. This is despite entrenched ideas and established trends in analysis. People don&#8217;t like him because he seems like a magician. He somehow knows what will happen without tapping into the usual prediction patterns and totems. This is why pundits could not understand Silver&#8217;s projections. They are speaking a different language. The old media is using grunts and hand motions, while Silver is speaking the Queen&#8217;s English. They didn&#8217;t even realize that Silver was not making <em>predictions</em>, he was issuing <em>projections</em>.</p>
<p>By analogy, baseball has long been a sport which can be predicted with incredible accuracy using statistics. This methodology is known at sabermetrics. It was the cornerstone of the the now-famous Moneyball system of Billy Beane. The idea is that some advanced statistics are more valuable than the &#8220;eye-test&#8221; or traditional statistics like RBI or even batting average. Finding players who produce good advanced statistics but do not produce good traditional statistics and getting those players for cheaper salaries because they are undervalued in the cornerstone of Moneyball. For many years, traditionalists have resisted sabermetrics. They don&#8217;t understand the math. They are jocks, not nerds. But slowly, advanced statistics are going mainstream. We are seeing more baseball people relying on good data as opposed to outdated and less valuable information.</p>
<p>With Silver&#8217;s incredible projections, it is clear that advanced statistics are going mainstream. This is a good thing for all of us. It means breaking down our biases and tendencies to see things the same old way and using math to see things more accurately. It will help society, a lot.</p>
<p>We need to rely less on accepted wisdom and more on science and math.</p>
<p>One correlation that I have seen is that skeptics who challenge conventional wisdom using science and math also exist in religious environment. These people don&#8217;t want to settle for fallacious arguments or accepted norms just because they are accepted norms. This manifests itself in orthodox Judaism with Daas Torah and people who challenge Daas Torah. The Nate Silvers of the world don&#8217;t accept arguments because of Appeal to Authority. The argument needs to stand on its own merits. It can be debated whether this is good for orthodox Jews or bad for orthodox Jews. However, I think it is clear that with the advent of sabertmetrics and fiverthirtyeight style projections that fewer people will be willing to submit themselves to an ephemeral concept like Daas Torah.</p>
<p>As always this leaves us with a choice. Do we double down on Daas Torah? Do we adjust Daas Torah and its expectations? Do we shutter Daas Torah?</p>
<p>Whichever we choose, let us hope that it is the right choice for the sake of truth and God.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/193920.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5728" title="193920" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/193920-233x300.png" alt="" width="233" height="300" /></a>The NFL has decided to give the fans the Holy Grail of NFL Football, the All-22 video.</p>
<p>What is this Holy Grail? It is the film that NFL coaches receive. It is different than broadcast footage because the broadcast only shows a small part of the game. The quarterback is the main focus of the broadcast and the viewer at home does not see what the wide receivers are doing nor do the viewers get a full grasp of how the defense covers the receivers or disguises blitzes. In short, the broadcast footage is very limited in what it allows the viewers at home to see.</p>
<p>ESPN got a very small percentage of All-22 for the NFL Matchup show. But in general, we the public, have never seen enough All-22 to understand the very complex game of the NFL completely.</p>
<p>The All-22 footage gives the viewer a full view of all 22 players on every play. It shows how the schemes look before the play and how the players move through the play. It is the definitive source of all NFL information. It shows everything.</p>
<p><span id="more-5726"></span></p>
<p>For years, the NFL has resisted giving away the All-22 film to the public. Their reasoning was that the public cannot handle the information. They are not initiated in the ways of NFL football like the coaches are and they will misinterpret the information. This will open the players and coaches to unwarranted criticism. Further, the broadcasters do have the All-22 during the game. That&#8217;s how they sound so smart. If people see what the broadcasters see, they will see behind the curtain and realize they are not that smart after all, they just have access to more information.</p>
<p>Now that will all change. We will all be able to see the All-22 footage. The NFL no longer holds the keys to the Ferarri. We all do now.</p>
<p>To me, is representative of a fundamental change in the way we approach information in 2012. Knowledge, wisdom, and information are expected to be accessible to all. They are expected to be available to anyone who wants it. This is the generation of Wikipedia. This is the generation of Google. This is the generation of free information.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica was a giant leap in making information accessible to many people. But they still needed to shell out a ton of cash to buy a full set or they could mosey on to the library and read it there. But it was not easy accessible to anyone and everyone. That&#8217;s the old model. Wikipedia is the new model. Free information.</p>
<p>The NFL has caught wind of this. They want to please their young fan base. Eventually they caved to pressure and now the most valuable NFL data is available to the public.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s this got to do with Judaism? Mysticism? Rationalism?</p>
<p>One of my favorite Torah scholars is Chacham Jose Faur. One of his favorite theories about the relationship between Maimonidean rationalism and mysticism / kabbalah is very relevant to this decision by the NFL.</p>
<p>Chacham Faur believes that the core of the battle between rationalism and mysticism is the accessibility of knowledge. In the mystical view, kabbalah is received wisdom that comes from great scholars and is imparted to great scholars only. It is not accessible to the masses as it is deemed too dangerous or too esoteric for the common people to grasp. Laws  can be changed based upon this extremely private knowledge base and it can even usurp revealed Torah found in the Talmud. It is so powerful, yet so few can gain entry into the kabbalah club. It takes years of Torah study and personal growth to be worthy of hearing this mystical knowledge.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, we find the teachings of Maimonides. It was his desire to turn this model on its head. Knowledge was to be accessible to all. The Mishneh Torah was written so that everyone who could read was able to access the core text of Judaism. It no longer required a process by which one had to prove himself to be worthy of knowing the law. It was available to everyone. Free information.</p>
<p>This was one of the primary arguments against the Mishneh Torah. It made things too easy.</p>
<p>But to a rationalist, it is impossible to justify keeping wisdom locked away from the public. So Maimonides followed in the footsteps of R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi and made Torah accessible to all.</p>
<p>This tension exists today as well. On one hand we have groups that try to make kaballah more accessible to the masses. But most orthodox Jews find this unacceptable. On the other hand, we have Daas Torah die-hards who are buying into the same structure as the mystics of the medieval era did with regard to policy setting and halachic decisions. The Daas Torah skeptics are more universalist with their approach to Torah and thus believe that everyone has access to all of Torah, not just a select group of Torah giants.</p>
<p>It is harder than ever to maintain the model of the mystics. The NFL finally gave in to the side rationalism and granted the public access to their information. In the orthodox Jewish world a similar struggle is starting and is likely to continue for the next few years.</p>
