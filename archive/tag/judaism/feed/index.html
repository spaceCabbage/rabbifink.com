				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/rabbis-round-table/.premium-1.560152" target="_blank">This article was originally published on Haaretz.com</a>. It is reproduced with their permission here:</em></p>
<p><em></em>Hanukkah has become an iconic holiday. In many ways, it has become as well known and popular as Christmas. But what exactly is its message?</p>
<p>The origins of Hanukkah are mired in obscurity. The rabbis of the Talmud established the days of Hanukkah as a commemoration for a small jug of oil that burned for eight days instead of burning for one day, as expected. Religious zeal and fervor were the themes of the first Hanukkah. For much of Jewish history, and for much of Orthodox Judaism today, the holiday retains much of its Talmudic meaning. Hanukkah is like a wink from a hidden God reminding us that when we stand up for our Judaism, God is standing with us.<span id="more-7914"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/185367.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7915" alt="185367" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/185367.jpg" /></a>This is not a very pluralistic message. It’s also not the way that most people look at Hanukkah today. Many people see that holiday as a celebration of religious freedom. Others see it as a beautiful way of competing with more popular holidays like Christmas. Yet others consider the military struggle for autonomy the central focus of the day.</p>
<p>Purists might <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.559378" target="_blank">recoil at the thought</a> that the Talmudic intent behind the holiday is being ignored or even changed.  I don’t think this is a valid concern.</p>
<p>Jewish holidays have multiple layers of meaning, often depending on time and place. During the First Temple period the holiday of Sukkot was a harvest holiday. Most Jewish people don’t celebrate the harvest aspect of the holiday anymore. Passover has meant different things to different people as well. It started as a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. For many people throughout the long exile it has come to symbolize our yearning to return to the Land of Israel and a Messianic utopia.</p>
<p>Even within the somewhat narrow confines of Orthodox Judaism, Hasidut added new elements and meaning to our holidays. We have a longstanding tradition of reinterpreting Jewish holidays.</p>
<p>There may be no starker historical example of this reinterpretation than Hanukkah itself. Maccabees I and Maccabees II provide their own reasons for the holiday. No miracle of oil is found in these texts. Josephus also neglects to mention this miracle. These sources focus primarily on the military victory.</p>
<p>It is pretty clear that the rabbis of the Talmud sought to refocus the day from a military victory and its attendant zealotry in favor of the commemoration of a miracle of a small cruse of oil. The Talmud glosses over the military victory in its description of the holiday.</p>
<p><em>“What is Chanukkah? That [which] our Sages taught: On the 25th of Kislev &#8211; the days of Chanukkah, they are eight, not to eulogize on them and not to fast on them, for when the Greeks entered the Temple, they polluted all the oils in the Temple, and when the Hasmonean dynasty overcame and defeated them, they checked and they found but one cruse of oil that was set in place with the seal of the High Priest, but there was in only [enough] to light a single day. A miracle was done with it, and they lit from it for eight days. The following year [the Sages] fix those [days], making them holidays for praise and thanksgiving.”</em> (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21A, Translation from Sefaria.org)</p>
<p>In the Talmud, the military victory is presented merely as incidental to the miracle of the oil. There was no miraculous victory and winning the war was not worth celebrating on its own in their view. The rabbis of the Talmud may be said to have started the tradition of reinterpreting the Hanukkah story.</p>
<p>Medieval commentaries asked why Hanukkah is eight days if the miracle was only for seven days? There was enough oil for one day! One day was natural and seven days were miracles, so we should celebrate seven days of miracle. One commentary reinterprets the military victory as a miracle to answer this famous question. Another reinterpretation. This time in nearly direct opposition to the Talmud’s version.</p>
<p>Reinterpretation is all part of the Hanukkah story. As long as the message is consistent with the ideals of Judaism and serve to help maintain a connection to the essence of the holiday, we should embrace new ideas. Orthodox Jews may insist that the laws of rabbinic Judaism are incontrovertible, and in our view they are, but the message and meaning of our holidays have long been much more fluid. If today’s Hanukkah message can be transformed to a more unifying and inspirational day for more Jews, so be it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>There is no more perfect secular holiday than Thanksgiving. It has a universal message, warm traditions, and is versatile enough to work to all kinds of people. I think it&#8217;s especially wonderful that so many Jewish people, including Orthodox Jews, have embraced Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>On a Jewish level there is nothing more basic than giving thanks. Gratitude begins the moment we arise with Modeh Ani. But that is a private declaration of appreciation to God. Thanksgiving gives us an opportunity to build greater gratitude with our friends and family. It&#8217;s a time to publicly give thanks to God and all the people in our lives who deserves appreciation. It&#8217;s true that we must be thankful everyday, but setting aside one day a year as a communal expression of appreciation is a wise tradition.<span id="more-7907"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7908" alt="The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961-600x382.jpg" width="360" height="229" /></a>Further, Jews need to be thankful simply for the existence of Thanksgiving. It is a uniquely American holiday and we have been blessed in America, flourishing and growing in unprecedented numbers. Thanksgiving celebrates America. We must celebrate America too. Indeed, we must be thankful for Thanksgiving itself.</p>
<p>Most of all, Thanksgiving gives us a splendid opportunity to share in an American tradition with our fellow Americans. So many other American traditions are antithetical to Torah and Judaism. We can&#8217;t in good conscience join in those celebrations. Christmas? Drinking and debauchery on New Years? Easter? as well as several other hallowed American traditions are not our traditions. But this one, Thanksgiving, that&#8217;s right in our wheelhouse. It gives us the chance to join together with the rest of America and in unison say thank you. That in itself is worth the effort to participate in the holiday. Although we don&#8217;t primarily associate as Americans, rather we are Jews first, it is a powerful declaration of unity to connect with 300 million Americans from diverse backgrounds, with a plurality of beliefs to celebrate Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>This year it&#8217;s even more fun as we can merge and meld some of our Chanukah traditions with Thanksgiving. The connections between the two holidays are self evident. Both were belated Sukkos style celebrations giving thanks to God. They are like siblings from the same parents.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s enjoy the holiday and be proud to live in a country that makes a holiday out of giving thanks, just like us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>There are quite a few approaches that religious people take in their attitude toward atheists and atheism. Three different ideas have been pitched or implemented in various outlets over the last couple of weeks. Seeing as so many of my fellow Jews are atheists, closeted or otherwise, I think it&#8217;s a question that contemporary Judaism must address.<span id="more-7721"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7722" alt="photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-600x449.jpg" /></p>
<p>A billboard in New York&#8217;s Times Square proclaims: <em>&#8220;To all of our atheist friends: Thank God you’re wrong.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cute line. It&#8217;s not very substantive and I see no chance of winning any atheists over with this kind of advertisement. It&#8217;s cool that God is getting a shout-out in Times Square. It&#8217;s definitely a lone voice among a very vocal majority of very unGodly advertisements and signage in that spot. But that&#8217;s the only value I can see in it.</p>
<p>The New York Times contrasted this billboard with a recent statement by the Pope: <em>“Given – and this is the fundamental thing – that God’s mercy has no limits, if He is approached with a sincere and repentant heart the question for those who do not believe in God is to abide by their own conscience. There is sin, also for those who have no faith, in going against one’s conscience. Listening to it and abiding by it means making up one’s mind about what is good and evil.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, I think the Pope is saying that actions are far more important than faith. This is particularly ironic coming from Catholicism which has traditionally placed such a great emphasis on belief. In fact, part of the Orthodox Jewish meme on Christianity is that they are all about faith while we are about action. (I&#8217;m not saying this is true. I am saying that this is taught.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a much more inclusive message than the billboard&#8217;s message. I think the Pope&#8217;s message will have a greater influence on positive social behavior than a snarky anti-atheist sign. It also increases the chances that a non-believer would care to be involved in religion. The Pope wins this one.</p>
<p>Rabbi Avi Shafran also proposed some billboards to promote Orthodox Judaism. His ideas: <em>What if, instead of special offers and glitzy offerings, we simply proclaimed loud and clear – in billboards and web ads and social media – that being a Jew, like it or not, precious fellow Jew, means being Divinely charged, that it means shouldering, whether it is always comfortable or not, responsibility ? And that ignoring that mandate is a reckless wasting of an opportunity to live a meaningful life by doing G-d’s will? That each of us has a stark and urgent choice: either to regard our lives as the brief opportunities to access eternity they are, or to waste one’s days in the pursuit of stuff and fun and “rights”?</em></p>
<p>I think this sounds more like the Times Square billboards than the Pope. While advertising our message is a great idea, I fear that advertising a hard line message is not going to win too many people over. I think that the approach largely depends on one&#8217;s goal. For some, the goal is that people join your movement. That&#8217;s a good goal if your movement is a good one. It also depends on whether people are amenable to your movements rules and regulations.</p>
<p>But Orthodox Judaism is not for everyone. It can be. But right now it is not. So perhaps we would be better off with a goal echoed by the Pope. We should be promoting positive, universal values that will help improve the world. Help people who might need a boost find something in their Judaism or other religious heritage that can help them in their lives.</p>
<p>There is so much that religion can offer people, even if they are not believers. Giving them those opportunities trumps snarky billboards and heavy handed pressure, in my opinion. Yes, we need to get the message out there. The question is what is that message.</p>
<p>I think the message is that religion and in particular Judaism can be beneficial to people no matter what they believe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Pew conducted a study of Jews in America and has released a comprehensive report based on its findings. Nearly 2800 religious Jewish people were interviewed and the results of those interviews make up the model for the results of the study. It&#8217;s difficult conduct a study like this and achieve meaningful results. I am not a statistician nor can I compare the sample sizes used in this study with others. To my untrained eye, it seems small.</p>
<p>There are many very interesting findings to discuss. I have three things I want to say about the study.</p>
<p>First, people will point to the staggering number of orthodox Jews who are no longer orthodox. That number is 52%. It seems impossible to believe. That means that over half of people raised orthodox are no longer orthodox. Think about the orthodox Jewish friends and family you know. Does it make sense to say that over half of them are no longer orthodox? I don&#8217;t think so.<span id="more-7664"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7665" alt="jew-chp3-3" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp3-3.png" />If you drill down a bit you notice a couple of things. For starters, I know many people who say they were raised orthodox because they went to a yeshiva or modern orthodox school even if they weren&#8217;t frum at home. I went to school with several people like that. Those people certainly skew the numbers. After all, the study relied on self identification. There was no process to classify people into categories other than to ask them.</p>
<p>But the real key here what the numbers are for young people being raised in contemporary orthodoxy. Those numbers are impressive. 83% of people raised as orthodox Jews under the age of 30 stay. This is a huge success. It&#8217;s also a number that correlates with anecdotal evidence. So the people who were raised orthodox and no longer are orthodox are mostly older people. What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means one of two things or perhaps a hybrid of two. [It doesn't mean that orthodox Jews leave the fold in their 30's and 40's at alarmingly high rates.] It could either mean that orthodoxy is much stronger today than it was 20 and 30 years ago. People get a better Jewish education, there is more insularity, and the shift to ultra orthodoxy which outnumbers modern orthodoxy by nearly 10:1 in this demographic is working to keep more orthodox Jews orthodox. Alternatively, it signifies a shift in who attends orthodox schools. In other words, 20-30 years ago it was far more likely for a family to send a child to an orthodox school and identify as orthodox even if they were not totally observant of halacha. There was more cross-pollination and there were fewer non-orthodox options. So you wind up with more people from previous generations identifying as being raised orthodox even though they weren&#8217;t truly orthodox through and through. This is rarer today because we are more insular and non-orthodox or unaffiliated Jews feel less comfortable in orthodox institutions. The truth is likely a combination of the two but the latter does concern me.</p>
<p>Also, very few middle aged and older people consider themselves ultra-orthodox. It&#8217;s a youth movement. Sure, some mellow out and switch affiliation. But it&#8217;s also a recent phenomena that is sweeping orthodoxy. It&#8217;s pretty compelling evidence that what is happening now for the under 40 orthodox Jew is different from what their parents and grandparents experienced. It&#8217;s a different kind of Judaism. The numbers bear it out.</p>
<p>Next, the non-orthodox denominations are falling apart. The numbers support the rumblings and rumors regarding the demise of Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism is dwindling as well. Some orthodox Jews like to cheer while these two denominations begin to disappear. Others view it as a sign that those Jews must be saved and brought into orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think that it is important for Judaism that non-orthodox denominations are strong and vibrant. I think that orthodox Jews should be concerned and make efforts to help revive non-orthodox Judaism. This sounds controversial and heretical but it&#8217;s really not. Orthodox Judaism is not going to magically become the Judaism for the 89% of non-orthodox Jews. We can either wish them well and watch them disappear or we can try to keep them connected to their Jewish heritage. I think the latter choice is preferable. Now we can either keep them connected by &#8220;making them orthodox&#8221; as if that is even possible, or we can rely on strong non-orthodox denominations to keep them in the fold. I think the latter choice is preferable here too. It&#8217;s certainly the more likely option to achieve widespread success. While resources are precious in the orthodox community, I think strengthening the non-orthodox denominations is a worthy endeavor. They are also our brothers and sisters. If we value what we have, we should do whatever we can to help them stay somewhat connected to their Judaism. A little bit of a good thing is a whole lot better than nothing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7666" alt="jew-chp4-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp4-2-306x600.png" /></p>
<p>The last thing for now are the numbers on belief in God. 96% of ultra-orthodox Jews are <em>certain </em>that there is a God. Certain. That&#8217;s a very high number. I also wonder how they can all be so certain. The modern orthodox number is 77%. Also a very high number for certainty. 8% of ultra-orthodox Jews believe but are less certain and 19% of modern orthodox Jews fit that description. I think that both of those numbers are really higher. Most people don&#8217;t think about belief in God. They just do it. But the question wasn&#8217;t simply about belief. The question measured the certainty of the believer. I am skeptical that someone can be certain of something without being able to make a compelling argument in favor of that certainty. How many of us can make that argument? If we can&#8217;t, can we be certain? <em>(Stay tuned for an essay on this issue sometime soon.)</em></p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting numbers in this section are the numbers of people who &#8220;do not believe.&#8221; Here the number for ultra-orthodox is 1% while it is 3% for modern orthodox. Practicing Judaism under a state of disbelief s not an easy proposition. If one doesn&#8217;t think the mitzvos and traditions have Divine meaning then they are bound to become a huge burden. However, orthopraxy &#8211; practicing Judaism despite disbelief is a growing trend. I wonder what these numbers will look like in a few years. It&#8217;s possible that more people who do not believe in God will feel comfortable in orthodox Judaism and they will grow as a public group. But it&#8217;s also possible that a rise in those numbers will inspire a thorough vetting of all orthodox Jews which would force all orthoprax Jews into a closet or out of orthodox Judaism altogether.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other interesting numbers to discuss. (97% of ultra-orthodox Jews have all or mostly Jewish friends. That&#8217;s insularity! How about only 57% of orthodox Jews are Republicans? And the support for Israel numbers need addressing as well.) Perhaps I will revisit the study and more of its social commentary in a future post. For now, these are the three things that jumped out at me.</p>
<p><em>Note: The orthodox people surveyed were all from Brooklyn, Monsey, and Lakewood. I think this might be significant.</em> (EDIT: This is imprecise. Those were the oversampled counties. My apologies.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Tonight we begin our Sukkos celebration. Of all the Jewish holidays, Sukkos is the most anachronistic. It is a harvest festival, it was marked by sacrifices on behalf of the Nations of the World, the highlight of the holiday was a libation ceremony in the Temple, we still sit in huts that resemble huts people actually used to used, and we still wave four particularly Middle Eastern species of vegetation. Not to mention the very recent innovation of Simchas Torah.<span id="more-7651"></span></p>
<p>When one looks for divrei Torah on the holiday it&#8217;s slim pickings. There is no Hagaddah. There is no special prayer book. There is no magnificent event or overt miracle that is being celebrated either. Rabbis inevitably talk about Hakhel, the unity represented by the Four Species, Koheles, or the usual metaphors associated with the Sukkah. It&#8217;s not very fertile ground.</p>
<p>So what are we to make of Sukkos today?<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7652" alt="sukkot1_1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sukkot1_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>I think Sukkos speaks to the perpetuity of Judaism despite social and historical change. Our circumstances change, but we keep plugging away. Sukkos today feels different than it felt to our ancestors. That does not matter at all. Their huts were real huts. Our Sukkahs are elaborate and quite comfortable. Their Four Species were rare and only some people had nice sets. We all have beautiful sets.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve taken a harvest holiday and turned it into a culmination of the High Holidays. We have managed to make Sukkos a day that focuses on more elevated concepts but the integrity of the holiday remains intact. We used to call it <em>Zman Simchaseinu</em> because of our bountiful harvest. Now we call it <em>Zman Simchaseinu</em> because we feel redeemed following our repentance of the High Holidays. Things change but they stay the same.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Sukkos is a model of how Judaism adapts without compromise. We do everything the Torah asks us to do as best as we can do it but it has as very different flavor. Yet, Sukkos persists and prospers. It&#8217;s a beautiful holiday full of spiritual moments, family time, and meaningful rituals.</p>
<p>I wish you all a beautiful holiday. People say <em>Chag Kasher V&#8217;Sameach </em>on Pesach. It&#8217;s equally appropriate on Sukkos. We need our Sukkah and <em>Arba Minim</em> to be kosher and the holiday requires us to be joyful. So I say <em>Chag Kasher V&#8217;Sameach</em> to you. See you after the holiday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>One of my most precious memories are the many years we sat in our family Sukkah with my grandparents as our guests. My grandmother still joins my parents for Sukkos sometimes. But my grandfather passed away almost 11 years ago ,yet his presence in my life is constant.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible for me to think about Sukkos without thinking of my grandfather singing &#8220;A Sukkeleh.&#8221; Even as I type these words I feel a swell of emotion and tears invade my eyes. It meant that much to us. I might not have appreciated it enough as a child, but I do now.<span id="more-7640"></span></p>
<p>With some Internet elbow grease I was able to get a digital copy of the song and after a couple of hours of work I put this video together. It might be nothing special or have little meaning to you but the song means a lot to me. My grandfather would have loved this. I don&#8217;t understand Yiddish so I had to find a translation of the words online. I used R&#8217; Shafran&#8217;s version as seen on <a href="http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/stillstands.html" target="_blank">Torah.org</a>  (see his article too) with a couple of tiny adjustments:<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7642" alt="tri_55474_1999-92" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tri_55474_1999-92.jpg" /></p>
<p>A sukkaleh, so small<br />
Wooden planks for each wall<br />
Lovingly I stood them upright<br />
I laid thatch as a ceiling<br />
And now, filled with deep feeling<br />
I sit in my sukkaleh at night.</p>
<p>A cold wind attacks,<br />
Blowing through the cracks<br />
The candles, they flicker and yearn<br />
It&#8217;s so strange a thing<br />
That as the Kiddush I sing<br />
The flames, calmed, now quietly burn.</p>
<p>In comes my daughter<br />
Bearing hot food and water<br />
Worry on her face like a pall<br />
She just stands there shaking<br />
And her voice nearly breaking<br />
Says &#8220;Tattenyu, the sukkah&#8217;s going to fall!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear daughter, don&#8217;t fret<br />
It hasn&#8217;t fallen yet<br />
The sukkah&#8217;s fine, banish your fright<br />
There have been many such fears<br />
For nigh two thousand years<br />
Yet the sukkeleh&#8217;s still standing upright.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>At the very least, Yom Kippur gives us a reason to put our lives on pause and evaluate how we are doing. Inevitably we&#8217;ve hurt some people along the way. Yom Kippur reminds us to make amends with those people who have been harmed by our insensitivity or malice. It&#8217;s obviously better to apologize and make peace than it is to allow the pain to fester and infect us long term.<span id="more-7626"></span></p>
<p>I am not a fan of digital requests for for forgiveness. They are impersonal and make it seem like one is trying to take a shortcut rather than the heartfelt apology that is deserved.<img class="alignright  wp-image-7627" alt="forgiveness-healing-heart" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/forgiveness-healing-heart-600x552.jpeg" width="420" height="386" /></p>
<p>However I do think that I need to make a digital request for forgiveness as well offer as an e-apology. Many people who read this blog or my thoughts on other digital platforms only know me through this medium. I don&#8217;t even know who many of you are. In fact the people who are probably most offended or hurt by things I have said are people that don&#8217;t even comment or &#8220;Like&#8221; posts on Facebook. They read, they get upset, and they are silent. Sometimes I get irate emails. I get it. I do appreciate the chance to have a dialogue. It is far better than when people just stay angry without seeking an explanation.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I know for certain that I have hurt people by the things I have written. For that I sincerely apologize. I don&#8217;t intend to hurt anyone and I regret that anyone was insulted or incensed by what I have written.</p>
<p>I am sorry for anything and everything that made you upset or made you feel bad about something. I know it happens and I am truly sorry.</p>
<p>I beg your forgiveness. Let&#8217;s go into Yom Kippur with a clean slate. All of us deserve the opportunity to pass through judgment by the Almighty free of the shackles interpersonal disputes place on us. We enter Yom Kippur with unity and one love.</p>
<p>As for all of you readers who may think you need to ask me forgiveness, you don&#8217;t. No one does. I don&#8217;t bear any grudges. I don&#8217;t take offense to anything you&#8217;ve written or said about me. I probably deserved it anyway. And even if I didn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s cool. Don&#8217;t worry.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a beautiful Yom Kippur. My favorite day of the year at Pacific Jewish Center is Yom Kippur. If you&#8217;d like to find out why, I invite you to join us either this year or sometime in the future. Wherever you are, I hope the day lives up to its lofty potential for you.</p>
<p><em>May we all be inscribed in the Book of Life.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>One of the most prominent themes of the High Holidays is our relationship with God as expressed by <em>Avinu Malkeinu.</em> This stirring prayer that has is origins in the Talmud makes use of a dual metaphor that informs so many of our thoughts and prayers this time of year.</p>
<p>Typically, the two metaphors represent different aspects of the way God relates to us and the way we relate to God. On the one hand God is our father and loves us like a father loves his children. We are God&#8217;s children and we look to God the way a child looks to a father. This is a compassionate, loving relationship that gives us comfort that no matter what</p>
<p>On the other hand God is our King. In this aspect of our relationship with God we find ourselves cowering in fear of God&#8217;s majesty and greatness. God is Master of the Universe. It&#8217;s God&#8217;s world and we are just guests in God&#8217;s world for a little while. This is meant to inspire reverence and respect for God.</p>
<p><span id="more-7604"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7607" alt="15" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/15.jpg" /></p>
<p>Put together, the two sides of the God Coin illuminate our attitudes this time of year. God loves us and is our Father, but God is also our King. There is plenty to say on this dichotomy. Perhaps we can take the usual interpretations of this dual metaphor one step deeper.</p>
<p>One does not choose one&#8217;s father. Fathers are imposed upon us. Everyone has a father. There is nothing particularly interesting about having a father. It&#8217;s built into the system. But most importantly, we can&#8217;t swap (biological) fathers. For better or worse, we&#8217;re stuck.</p>
<p>Monarchs are different. It&#8217;s true that one seems to be stuck with the king of the land where one is born. But the truth is that kings come and go. Borders change and people move. It&#8217;s a pure choice, but decided to pledge fealty to one&#8217;s king is a form of personal subjugation. It takes an act by the subject to crystallize the King and Subject relationship. If you don&#8217;t like your king you can try to mount a revolt or leave the area of jurisdiction. One day the king will die. Kings are not permanent nor are they automatic.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to God is there a choice? The kingship of God is not dependent on anything that we can do. It is automatic. We cannot leave God&#8217;s jurisdiction and move somewhere else to find another God. We are stuck.</p>
<p>That is why we also compare God to a father. While it&#8217;s true that God is like a king, the metaphor is incomplete. Comparing God to a king only goes so far. God cannot be deposed nor can one find a better or different God. That&#8217;s why we also need to compare God to a father. God is a king that is imposed upon us. We cannot trade Gods nor do we have a choice about who our God will be. In this sense, God as our father illustrates the imperative nature of God&#8217;s kingship over us.</p>
<p>Conversely, when we relate to God as a father we can feel stuck in a negative sense. We can wish we had a different father or we can dream about being free from the shadow of our parents. This is why we sometimes need to relate to God as our king. We voluntarily accept God as our king and as our father. This aspect of God as our king transforms our relationship with God as a father. It&#8217;s not just that we deal with God like a sometimes petulant child that would love to break free of God. We willingly subjugate ourselves in God&#8217;s kingdom even though we God is our father.</p>
<p>Above all else, I think this dual metaphor must inspire us to strive to be good sons and daughters to God as well as good subjects. Sometimes we act toward God with the love and admiration of a son or daughter. Other times we need to draw on the strength of relating to God as subjects in God&#8217;s eternal kingdom. It&#8217;s not enough to think about God as our father and king. We must also think about how <em>we are</em> God&#8217;s children and the people who live in God&#8217;s kingdom. The metaphor can&#8217;t stop with how we think about God. The metaphor needs to affect the way we think about ourselves as well.</p>
<p>When we appreciate the metaphor of <em>Avinu Malkeinu</em> we can feel a sense of love and fear that mixes together in the perfect service of God cocktail. Drink up!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>I don&#8217;t know when or exactly how or why, but at some point in my childhood I became enamored with Martin Luther King Jr. and the speech he gave 50 years ago today. I remember that one of the first things I did on the Internet was listen to the speech. I will never forget the euphoric feeling I experienced when I heard Dr. King say <em>&#8220;&#8230;when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God&#8217;s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, &#8220;Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!&#8221;<span id="more-7585"></span></em></p>
<p>The speech influenced me greatly and I had a <a href="http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf" target="_blank">faux archive version copy of the speech</a> in my childhood desk drawer.</p>
<p>Ever since then I have shared the same dream as Dr. King.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7586" alt="GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Content of their character. We are getting there. It&#8217;s very hard to avoid our natural biases. It&#8217;s a lifetime effort. It&#8217;s something everyone needs to work on and Dr. King calls upon us to do just that.</p>
<p>Similarly, I urge all of us to judge ideas by the content and substance of the idea and not the value we place in the person making the statement.</p>
<p>But I have a dream that in the Jewish community we can judge one another by the content of our character and not by our affiliations and style of clothing. My dream is that we can create a global Jewish community united by far more than the things that separate us.</p>
<p>One day, all Jews, no matter their belief in God, Torah M&#8217;Sinai, or the Afterlife will work together to provide positive Jewish experiences for our communities. One day, whether we are Zionist or indifferent, liberal or conservative,  we can form a united Jewish nation. One day, mystics and rationalists, GRAniks and chasidim will dance together. One day it won&#8217;t matter who one&#8217;s grandparents were or which town one&#8217;s family came from in Europe or &#8220;God forbid,&#8221; if they came from one of the Arab countries.</p>
<p>Dr. King&#8217;s dream resonates with all of us. It gives us hope for a better future. A future where pettiness and narcissism give way to tolerance and empathy. That is my dream.</p>
<p>How do we get there? We fight against drawing imaginary lines that only serve to divide us. We argue for the rights of those who are under-represented within our ranks. We strive to give our children every opportunity to succeed and find meaningful, joyous, passionate Judaism that is inclusive, understanding, and loving. We reach out to our ideological opponents and offer them friendship with no strings attached. We explore innovative and comprehensive solutions to our social problems instead of applying bandaids to severed limbs.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a dream. But it&#8217;s a dream I believe in strongly. It is a dream worth fighting for. It is a dream that Dr. King inspired in a little boy who grew up to be me.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, the speech echoes through my brain. It&#8217;s message cuts through the noise and sings a beautiful song of hope. Thank you Dr. King for inspiring generations of people and thank you for inspiring me with the greatest speech I have ever had the privilege to hear. On its 50th anniversary we say thank you.</p>
<p>I hope we will live to see your dream come true and all of our dreams as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The new issue of The New Republic cover story is about us. It is about Haredim, modern Orthodox, and women. These are things we discuss regularly online and at our Shabbos tables, and in our coffee rooms. The story is remarkably accurate and balanced, displaying a very deep understanding of the issues in Israel today. I recommend reading the article immediately.</p>
<p>Imagine a spectrum of religious fundamentalism in the orthodox Jewish community. On one end you have extreme Haredi sects and on the other end you have completely secular Israelis. On most things and for most of time the people in the middle, let&#8217;s call them modern orthodox, skewed their allegiences toward the Haredi side. Orthodoxy is the great uniter. The assumption is that any two orthodox people will have more common interests than an orthodox and a secular Jew. This is how things were.<span id="more-7442"></span></p>
<p>In essence, the article argues that while naturally aligned with their fellow orthodox Jews, women from the modern orthodox community in Israel are finding themselves aligned with secular feminist Jews in Israel. The collective pain that is felt due to the oppressiveness toward women in the extreme and not so extreme Haredi world is taking a toll. Women have been attacked physically, verbally, and psychologically for a long time and it is starting to create a negative reaction.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7443" alt="article_inset_lithwick_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/article_inset_lithwick_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Several times the article mentions signs that tell women how to dress. We have become accustomed to these signs. But the women in the article argue that the signs give license to thugs who want to make a statement to women. To them, the signs mean much more than &#8220;Please be sensitive to our religious beliefs.&#8221; Part of that is because these standards are entering the public sphere and are no longer just limited to the private insular neighborhoods. But the other part of it is that the signs are somehow justifying the negativity and violence toward women.</p>
<p>What has happened is that women who feel hurt and abused are turning to secular and Reform Jews for salvation. Feminism is a dirty word in many orthodox communities, even in some places within the modern orthodox community. But it&#8217;s becoming a necessary evil for modern orthodox women who are not feminists at all to ask for help from feminists. It&#8217;s odd when orthodox people are funding they have more in common with secular and very liberal Jews than fellow orthodox Jews. But that is what is happening.</p>
<p>The article also talks about modern orthodox women who sympathize with the Women of the Wall. I wish they would be more vocal but i was heartened to hear it.</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about finding common ground and room for dialogue between modern orthodox and yeshivish Jews in America. (See:<br />
<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/08/02/maybe-rabbi-birnbaum-has-a-point-a-solution/">Maybe Rabbi Birnbaum Has a Point: A Solution</a>) I think what we are seeing in the article in TNR is what will happen if we can&#8217;t work together. If the people in the middle start to feel like the liberal and secular Jews are more sympathetic to their way of life, the great split that has been predicted for years, will finally happen. Modern orthodox Judaism will become an independent group.</p>
<p>Some might say, what&#8217;s so bad about that? Well there are plenty negative consequences to mention. But I will mention the two biggest issues. First, the Haredi institutions will fall without modern orthodox support. Some might say that&#8217;s not so bad either. I disagree. Their services are necessary, as is their trap door into engagement with society. On the other side, without a connection the Haredi community, the modern orthodox community will be hard pressed to support its own institutions for lack of qualified teachers and rabbis.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not in our best interests to see a formal split. It might happen in Israel and it might happen in America. I think we should do everything we can to prevent it. The first thing we need to do, is get together and talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>There was a great article in the NY Times last week about nostalgia. I believe that nostalgia is a very important element of the religious experience. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/21/the-magical-secret-of-the-seder/">The Magical Secret of the Seder</a>)</p>
<p>I had no idea that until recently nostalgia was considered a mental disorder. Apparently, it was thought to be akin to depression. But people who were nostalgic were not sad and so research commenced to determine the proper classification and function of nostalgia.</p>
<p>It turns out that nostalgia is actually pretty useful. Studies have shown that nostalgia can make people feel happier, can physically warm the body, can give people hope, and overall improve one&#8217;s life. This all serves very important evolutionary purposes. Modernly, it helps with relationships in general and in particular with marriage. Good memories make for good relationships.<span id="more-7393"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7394" alt="V7K1cJRPaafgLZP" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/V7K1cJRPaafgLZP-600x450.jpg" /></p>
<p>Looking at nostalgia through the lens of the religious person, nostalgia becomes even more useful. If our religion gives us good memories and makes us feel good when we are young it is going to be important to us to relive those memories year to year and life event to life event. Even more importantly, it motivates us to give our children similar experiences. We want our children to look fondly upon their youth and we want religion to be front and center in their positive memories.</p>
<p>I think we should cultivate good memories. We should create our own nostalgia. We should actively mine those memories for good feelings towards people, family, spouses, and of course religion. Jewish holidays are perfect for this kind of work but really it should be a full time effort.</p>
<p>All this leads me to two issues that are plaguing the orthodox Jewish community right now.</p>
<p>Victims of sex abuse invoke many coping mechanisms to deal with the betrayal and violence of the crimes perpetrated against them. Obviously, if the abuser is an authority or religious figure, the victim&#8217;s associations with religion become supremely negative. There is little religious nostalgia for victims. Even worse, is when the coping mechanism involves repressing memories of one&#8217;s childhood. Some victims cannot even remember their childhood. Clearly, these victims have no nostalgia towards their religion. They may stay in the fold for other reasons, but an important part of their religious experience is left with a gaping hole instead of positive memories. Aside from robbing children of their innocence and inflicting untold pain of their victims, predators paint over their victim&#8217;s childhood memories with a very big, very dark brush. This has many negative consequences, including religious consequences.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have witnessed there is a recent spate of <i>baalei teshuva </i>returning to their prior lives and leaving orthodox Judaism. This group also lacks the nostalgia of an orthodox Jewish upbringing. This is not a defect. It can be a difference that does not make a distinction. But for some people, it can be hard to stay in the orthodox Jewish community and for some of those people nostalgia is a decent motivating factor. Unfortunately, those who choose to become orthodox later in life lack this secret weapon. Sometimes that can make all the difference in the world between staying or leaving.</p>
<p>The article in the NY Times corroborates what I think is a very underappreciated part of being an orthodox Jew. Nostalgia. Those who are missing it, whether because of despicable violence or courage to choose orthodox Judaism are often missing this non-essential ingredient. But we all have the power to give it to our children and I contend that it&#8217;s a very worthwhile endeavor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>I was invited to join Rabbi Shafran to talk about recent comments by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and the subsequent response by the Agudah. We discussed it on Facebook on Friday and I guess Zev or one of his producers saw the comment thread and decided to ask me onto the show. The format of the show was to be a moderated discussion between Rabbi Shafran and me.<span id="more-7357"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran represented the Agudah position. I represented the non-Agudah position.<img class="size-medium wp-image-7358 alignright" alt="old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The gist of Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s argument was that Rabbi Sacks was criticizing a legitimate form of orthodox Judaism and was doing so from a place of ignorance as evidenced by his mention of the Siyum HaShas as an example of inward turning segregationism. Thus, the Agudah was standing up for themselves and the more insular communities who were criticized.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the Agudah over reacted. Rabbi Sacks was not even criticizing the insular communities as much as he was warning of a potential danger if the trend to the right continues. In his view, and in mine, there is a lot of value in a version of Judaism that sympathizes with orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Judaism should be careful not to eliminate this soft center between non-orthodox Judaism and orthodox Judaism. While the choice of the Siyum HaShas was unfortunate, I don&#8217;t think it accurately reflected his sentiments.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Rabbi Sacks meant, this is an important discussion and I invited Rabbi Shafran and the radio audience to have that discussion. While it is entertaining to argue about what Rabbi Sacks was trying to say, it is far less important than the substance his point.</p>
<p>Listen to the show below. I&#8217;ve cut the 2 hour show into 1:20 of just talking. So no ads or news will disturb your listening. The quality of the recording is pretty brutal but this was what I received from the producer.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Meditation was once an oddity reserved for spiritual extremists. Today, meditation is as American as apple pie.</p>
<p>There are many good reasons to do meditation. The NY Times enumerates several of the benefits that have been demonstrated by science. Improved leadership and productivity can be attributed to meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation has a place in Judaism as well. Many great Jewish thinkers have described Jewish prayer as a form of meditation. The prophets of yore achieved their heightened spiritual state after intense meditation. There are pious chasidic men (and maybe some women) who meditate alone in the Jerusalem Forest on a regular basis. For us, meditation is a word to describe an activity whose end is to achieve some state of nirvana. It could even be argued that making blessings before eating food or enjoying any other physical pleasure is a variation of mindfulness.<span id="more-7348"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7349 alignright" alt="meditation-6" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/meditation-6-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The NY Times reports that there is a reason that Buddha favored meditation. Buddha&#8217;s teachings were to end suffering. Meditation was intended to serve as a way of freeing one&#8217;s mind of the negative thoughts we have about others. The idea was to bring people together through the heightened state of awareness.</p>
<p>This is a lofty claim and it was put to the test by the author of the NY Times article, profesor of psychology Dr. David DeSteno. He and his lab conducted controlled experiments to determine if meditation had an impact on empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>The results? Incredibly, or maybe not, meditation actually helped a significant portion of test subjects feel empathetic. It works!</p>
<p>DeSteno concludes that while the fringe benefits are great, when one meditates one should be mindful of its original purpose. Hopefully if we can channel that power we can alleviate the pain of division and hate.</p>
<p>I can think of no message more appropriate for Rosh Chodesh Av. This time of year we are exhorted to work on our interpersonal skills. Perhaps it would be wise to spend some time in meditation to give ourselves an assist on this seasonal challenge.</p>
<p>The article also got me thinking about doing Mitzvos to reap the social benefits of the act or even to reap an alternative benefit that was certainly unintended. Sometimes people lament the new-agey interpretations of Mitzvos and modern understandings of their social benefits. True, it can feel uncomfortable, but I think it&#8217;s noteworthy that we find similar hand wringing with regard to meditation. DeSteno is a bit uncomfortable with using meditation to get ahead instead of using it to unite. I think we can relate to that.</p>
<p>Finally, one can imagine how vindicated followers of Buddha must feel. As orthodox Jews, we feel the same way some our traditions and teachings are corroborated by modern discoveries. I know I love when that happens, so I am sure the study mentioned in this article will bring similar feelings of euphoria to students of Buddha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/noah.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7229" alt="noah" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/noah-300x163.jpg" width="300" height="163" /></a>One of the more difficult stories in the Bible is the story of Noah and the Flood. It is confounding on several fronts.</p>
<p>The morality of the tale challenges us. The text of the narrative is confusing. The presence of competing flood narratives from the rest of the ancient world gives us pause. The paucity of scientific and archaeological evidence of a massive flood is disconcerting. Perhaps most of all, it is difficult for our modern ears to hear the relevance of the story today.</p>
<p>All the aforementioned issues can be answered with a variety of approaches. We have dealt with some of the them on this blog. (See here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/10/17/a-possible-bombshell-from-rabbi-j-h-hertz-on-the-great-flood-in-parshas-noach/" target="_blank">Flood Bombshell</a>)</p>
<p>On Tablet Magazine <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/author/mingall/">Marjorie Ingall</a> reviews a new book with a version of the flood story told as if it were an Indian scroll. Sounds cool.<span id="more-7228"></span></p>
<p>The book and its review are not relevant to me. But what I do find interesting is how Ms. Ingall find modern relevance to the story. She says that for children the story teaches the lessons of the &#8220;Peaceable Kingdom.&#8221; It&#8217;s a message that the world needs to be harmonious to exist. This is a great lesson for children. As for adults, it is a message that no matter what calamity may befall us or our children, we have hope in a better tomorrow. This is also a great lesson.</p>
<p>Why am I talking about this?</p>
<p>There are two things I want to take from her article. First, orthodox Jews have a tendency to think that we have a monopoly on <em>drush. </em>Sometimes we have a hard time remembering that non-orthodox Jews are also dealing with the challenges of the Torah and they often have great ideas that we can learn from. In this instance, making the flood story contemporary is a difficulty that we share. To be sure, there are some non-orthodox people who will dismiss the flood story as ancient literature with no lessons for today. But when they make an honest attempt to view the stories as eternal and take legitimate lessons from the story, we can incorporate them into our perspective on the story.</p>
<p>Secondly, as time passes, the stories of the Bible can begin to seem old or out of date. It is our job to find eternal meaning in these stories because they were given to us as eternal stories. There are many ways to do this. We can hyper-literalize or we can adapt our thinking or try many other ideas in between the two. There is definitely value in seeking modern lessons in ancient stories. Most importantly, these stories remain in our collective subconscious and demand that we address them. Children love the flood story. Every culture has a flood story. There has to be a reason for this and more importantly, these stories become part of our DNA. Excising the stories or rejecting the stories is to reject a part of ourselves.</p>
<p>There is something universal about the flood story. You&#8217;ll find it has appeal across the spectrum of Judaism. For example, the Skirball Center in Los Angeles has a yearly Ark Exhibit that is visited by tens of thousands of people. Most of them are not orthodox. Even our less orthodox brethren love the flood story for its many teachings and lessons. We could learn a thing or two from them on this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7218" alt="616hOnPIlZL._SL1000_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/616hOnPIlZL._SL1000_-186x300.jpg" width="186" height="300" /></a>I received a review copy of the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> siddur a few weeks ago. Over the last few weeks I have been test driving the siddur.</p>
<p>For starters, I have never used such a beautiful prayer book. The pages are laid out very well. The typography is excellent and a pleasure to read, no italics thankfully. We are given basic instructions for the service throughout and I found them to be accurate and useful. The translation was decent enough. There were some odd choices, but it&#8217;s like a happy marriage between Artscroll and Koren. What sets apart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is the photos.</p>
<p>Many of us have seen their &#8220;benchers&#8221; with gorgeous illustrative photos. That concept has now been extended to the Shabbat siddur. It is not without careful consideration and considerable hemming and hawing that the photos were deemed appropriate. Several writers in the introductory remarks justify the inclusion of photos in the siddur. Personally, I think it&#8217;s an acceptable idea and found using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> with its photos mostly a positive experience. Praying with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is an interesting journey and I appreciated the effort to explain the use of photos in the siddur.</p>
<p><span id="more-7054"></span></p>
<p>What struck me most about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> was that it does not idealize charedim. I know this sounds odd when talking about a siddur, but the photos editorialize the text. The ideals expressed in the photos are very Zionist, very religious, and very un-charedi.</p>
<p>For example, we photos of women learning gemara. We see young women IDF soldiers as we sing Eishes Chayil. The elderly man from <em>Na&#8217;ar hayisi, v&#8217;gam zakanti </em>is a non-charedi man as well. Where there are photos of young boys learning Torah, we have young girls learning Torah on the opposing page. There are even photos of women dancing. The photo for <em>sefiras ha&#8217;omer </em>is a field, not a <em>sefirot </em>or any other Zohar centric imagery. Even the Shabbos food in the photos is not charedi. No cholent and kugel here. It&#8217;s like a Mediterranean style feast.</p>
<p>There are scant picture of charedim. The photos of charedim that are in the siddur do not glorify the usualy hallmarks of charedi society. One photo of charedim is of a yeshiva boy dancing at a wedding. Another photo is the famous photo of a rabbi being leered and jeered at by Nazi officers as he stands in his talis and tefilin. It&#8217;s weird using a religious book with so little charedi influence. We are so accustomed to orthodox Judaism being a charedi centric religion. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> turns that on its head. Religious Zionism is seen as the ideal in this siddur.</p>
<p>I took issue with a few of the editorial choices. First, the verse <em>poseach es yadecha umasbia l&#8217;chol chai ratzon </em>is illustrated in the siddur just as it is illustrated in the bencher. We see third world children with hungry eyes and smiling faces on this page. It&#8217;s disconcerting for two reasons. 1) There is tremendous hunger in third world countries. It is ironic at best to be using these photos for this verse. 2. It&#8217;s makes the African, Southeast Asian, and Indian children look like props. Almost everyone else in the siddur is Jewish. Why use these third world children here? It&#8217;s odd. It leads to another strange editorial choice. For the phrase <em>yakiru v&#8217;yedu kol yoshvei tevel </em>they show Buddhists and some Asian people looking upward as if to imply they now see God. I don&#8217;t like this choice either. We have fellow Jews who have yet to discover or believe in God, why are we shifting the focus to these other people?<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Another quirk is that almost all the liturgy about the Exodus and redemption is reinterpreted to refer to the Holocaust and the State of Israel through photos. In other words, as you are reading about our bondage in Egypt you see Holocaust photos. And as you read about the redemption and ancient entry to the Land of Canaan, you see Zionist pioneers in the modern Israel. Non-Zionists might find this disconcerting. But I would hope that it could subversively influence skeptics about Israel to see the parallels and perhaps embrace the State of Israel more fully.</p>
<p>Of course more of the photos are of outer space and nature panoramas. These photos are not editorial at all and I believe greatly enhance one&#8217;s appreciation of the liturgy.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is a great &#8220;change-up&#8221; siddur. I would not use it every week because I think the photos would fade into the pages and we would not even notice them anymore. But I certainly recommend buying at least one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> siddur and sharing it with your family. Let a different family member use it each week and I am sure your appreciation for the Shabbos prayers will increase.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4590176018_086a2de7ab_o.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7149" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4590176018_086a2de7ab_o-300x227.jpg" width="300" height="227" /></a>“And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.” &#8211; Number 14:1</em></p>
<p>Upon hearing the negative report of the spies about the Land of Canaan, the Israelites were forlorn. They believed they would have no chance of conquering the land and so they wept. The Talmud tells us in the name of Rabbi Yochanan that the night they wept was the 9th of Av. God told the Israelites that they cried for no reason on 9th of Av in the desert so God would give them a real reason to cry in the future. It seems that our first and second temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av as retribution for the communal sin of the spies and their slander.</p>
<p>The Book of Lamentations wails over the destruction of the first temple. According to the Talmud it also hints at the reasons for the destruction. Each of the first four chapters of the book forms an acrostic with the first letter of each sentence forming the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew alphabet the letter Ayin precedes the letter Peh. However, the verse in Lamentations chapter 1 beginning with the letter Peh precedes the verse beginning with the letter Ayin. This is because the Peh, which can also refer to the mouth, jumped ahead of the Ayin, which can also refer to the eye. The spies spoke about things that their eyes did not see and so the Peh precedes the Ayin in Lamentations to allude to the sin that caused the destruction of the temple.</p>
<p>There is a problem with this interpretation.<span id="more-7148"></span> The problem is that it seems from the Talmud that the sin of the spies related to saying something with their mouths that they did not see. That’s a very normal way Lashon Hara, evil speech, is spread. But according to the text of the story, the spies merely reported what they actually did see. They saw a land that swallows its inhabitants. They saw giants. They even brought huge fruits as souvenirs. The spies editorialized a bit, yet we would never say that they spoke about what they did not see. How does this teaching of the Talmud fit in with the facts of the story from the text of the Book of Numbers?</p>
<p>Rabbi Shimon Schwab offers a beautiful explanation. R’ Schwab says that people see things the way that they alone see them. In other words, our personality, attitude, feelings, and experience color what our eyes see. Two people can look at the same thing and one can see spiritual beauty and the other can see physical beauty. Or two people can look at the same thing and one can see something ugly and the other can see something beautiful. It’s a matter of perspective and perception.</p>
<p>Take someone who knows nothing about the Jewish people or the history of Israel and show them the Kotel. That person will see rocks. Big rocks. And a wall. But take a person with an appreciation for its holiness and that person will see the grandeur of the Kotel as a place of worship and spirituality. It all depends on the person who is looking.</p>
<p>Similarly, the spies went to the Land of Canaan. They could have seen its inherent spiritual beauty. They could have seen the incredible opportunities for religious life and personal growth present in the land. But their eyes were not tuned into those things. The spies were only able to see the land with material vision. They could only appreciate the physical attributes of the land. They saw death and giants and large produce. They did not see the spiritual value of the land. The spies should have seen the Divine Presence on Mount Moriah. They should have felt the holiness of Hebron. But they did not. Why? Because they were using their eyes that were focused only on material things, not spiritual reality.</p>
<p>This explains why the Peh preceded the Ayin. The mouth spoke what the eyes did not see. The eyes should have seen a land of holiness and spirituality. The mouth spoke what it did not see. The mouth spoke of physical flaws and challenges. The spiritual eyes of the spies were closed and they did not see what they should have seen. This was the cause of their demise.</p>
<p>Every situation in our lives and in the public discourse has at least one way of looking at it. The way one sees something is influenced by their personality, experience, and feelings. Although we may be convinced our way is the correct way there is always another way to look at the same facts and draw different conclusions.</p>
<p>This is an important lesson in a global community. We live in a world where people with varied life experiences and environments, thus we are bound to see the same things through different lenses. Understanding that we can see the same things as another person and arrive at completely different conclusions is necessary in our modern world.</p>
<p>We must take the lesson of the spies and use the right glasses to see things the right way. But we also must understand that when others see things differently than we do, often it is because they are different people with a different pair of glasses. Knowing this, we can take steps to further our understanding and appreciation of others and their ideas bringing us closer to a day of peace among all inhabitants of the earth. Good Shabbos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/history-minor.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7144" alt="history-minor" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/history-minor-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>Conor Friedersdorf has an excellent article on theatlantic.com called &#8220;<a href="ve/2013/05/history-is-beautiful-things-made-by-people-with-ugly-ideas/276328/" target="_blank">History Is Beautiful Things Made by People With Ugly Ideas</a>&#8220;. He argues that a graduate student who refuses to sing a song written by Walt Whitman because Whitman was a racist is wrong. The song itself is not racist however its composer said some very racists things in his life.</p>
<p>Friedersdorf writes that history is full of flawed men and women who did things that we would find abhorrent today. If we disregard their accomplishments because we are looking at them through modern glasses we lose all their contributions to society. Taking this idea to the extreme, it would be akin to not performing a surgery because the person who discovered or refined the technique was a racist or a bigot. We would lose almost all modern progress if the only people from whom we accepted their ideas or inventions were perfect people.</p>
<p>Instead we must view our forebears as products of a time where things were different than they are today. Even if it was the same world, modernity is built upon the ideas of flawed people.<span id="more-7143"></span></p>
<p>Reading this, I thought about how valuable this perspective of history can be to religions in general and Judaism in particular. The greatest contributors to Judaism over our history were incredible scholars and masters of the soul. They perfected their understanding of Torah and worked on their character to be saintly as they could be. In order to truly appreciate Torah, one must be a master over one&#8217;s spirit as well. Our Torah heroes accomplished all that and more.</p>
<p>But it would be foolish to think that anything that they thought must be flawless. They were not. It would be equally foolish to dismiss all of their contributions and accomplishments simply because of those flaws or mistakes. Ideas stand on their own. The ideas of our Judaism stand on the shoulders of giants. Just because those giants were not perfect does not mean that their ideas should be rejected.</p>
<p>However, if we, like the graduate student, expect flawlessness from our leaders we will be faced with two options. Either we can reinterpret everything they did and said to reflect our expectations of perfection or we will be forced to rid ourselves of all the incredible insights and contributions because we discover that they were not perfect.</p>
<p>I know which option makes the most sense to me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7062" alt="174928094" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a>MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is ruffling the feathers of many charedi Gedolim in Israel and America. It seems there are two levels to the rhetoric against MK Lipman.</p>
<p>Primarily, I think many have a problem with him by dint of his association with MK Yair Lapid. It is an article of faith that Lapid is anti-charedi and since MK Lipman is a member of MK Lapid&#8217;s party he is guilty by association. I don&#8217;t think it would be possible to support Yesh Atid and have charedi approval.</p>
<p>Secondarily, many have a problem with MK Lipman&#8217;s positions. I think that his positions are perceived as anti-charedi and therefore anti-Torah. In particular, supporting a requirement that save for specific instances, all charedim participate in the army or national service and join the workforce instead of a blanket exemption for all charedim from service. MK Lipman also supports requiring a basic secular education for all Israelis, no exceptions. By the way, he also supports a better Jewish education for all Israelis, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care to discuss whether charedim are truly the most authentic orthodox Jews or whether they are corrupting Judaism. That&#8217;s a discussion for another time. I want to discuss the reaction of American charedim to MK Lipman&#8217;s proposals.<span id="more-7060"></span></p>
<p>In Israel, a charedi is identified by several social and religious markers. I list them here in no particular order, nor is this list exhaustive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Manner of dress. Charedim wear black and white, sport felt or fur hats, and shun modern style of dress like jeans or T-shirts.</li>
<li>Fear of God. Charedim place God and religion above all else. The word of God is supreme.</li>
<li>Daas Torah. Charedim extend their fealty to the word of God beyond the words of the Written Torah, and even beyond the Oral Law, to include the words of the great rabbis and treat their words like the word of God.</li>
<li>Torah learning is the ultimate service of God. Working for a living is not ideal at best and is actively avoided at worst.</li>
<li>No secular education. Charedim send their children to private schools which do not teach anything that is not found in the Torah.</li>
<li>Rejection of Zionism. The State of Israel is not recognized as a positive development for the Jewish people. It is more likely described as a problem than a solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is your Israeli Charedi checklist.</p>
<p>However in America, people who consider themselves charedi use a different set of parameters.</p>
<p>I think that American charedim subscribe to 1-3, but not necessarily 4-6. The only people in America who truly hold of 4-6 would be chasidim and not all chasidim would agree with 4-6 either. Certainly, many chasidim do not agree with #4 and in America even the chasidic communities are required to give a basic (not sufficient) secular education.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter?</p>
<p>It seems to me, that American charedim are more similar to MK Lipman than they are to Israeli charedim. It is conceivable that MK Lipman could word his platform a little bit differently and still mean the exact same thing. He could say &#8220;I want Israeli charedim to be like American charedim&#8221; and the practical ramifications would be strikingly similar.</p>
<p>I think MK Lipman would be thrilled if Israeli charedim were like Lakewood charedim. They get a secular education, they work (eventually), they even support the State of Israel to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Yet, American gedolim and charedim in America continue to malign MK Lipman and his platform. I don&#8217;t get it. All he is saying is that Israeli charedim should be more like American charedim! He wants them to be like us! They should be flattered. Not insulted!</p>
<p>R&#8217; Ahron Feldman is a Rosh Yeshiva of a yeshiva that is precisely what MK Lipman wants for Israeli charedim and yet he severely criticizes MK Lipman going so far as to call him a rasha. It doesn&#8217;t add up. If what we have in America is good why is it not good for our brothers and sisters in Israel? And even if what they have could be conceived of as better, it&#8217;s not so terrible to be like the American charedim, is it?</p>
<p>True, the two groups share one name &#8211; Charedim. But they are different types of charedim!</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is complicated. Army service can be difficult for charedim. We can understand the reluctance to become less insular and take time away from Torah study. These are reasonable critiques of the sweeping proposals being discussed right now. But let&#8217;s be reasonable. We can talk about the issues and figure out the best way to deal with them.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that there are some potential problems with MK Lipman&#8217;s plan. It&#8217;s not easy to just throw away the old system. There are going to be complications. But I think we will be far more successful if we work together. The plan is not to turn charedim into secular Zi0nists. How about just acting more like American charedim? Seems to me that it should be a workable solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7033" alt="library-books" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books-298x300.jpg" width="298" height="300" /></a>There are several dozen prohibitions in the Torah that relate to idol worship. Writing in the 12th century, Maimonides stridently warns against studying the texts of idolatry or even learning about idol worship. (Hilchos Avodas Kochavim 2:2)</p>
<p>The argument against interfacing with idol worship is that the human mind is drawn towards the things that one studies. One is not always in perfect control of what one thinks and what one wants. So even if one is studying for the sake of satisfying curiosity, or even learning to rebut, one may be drawn toward idol worship. Maimonides extends this law to include heresy as well.</p>
<p>This is all kinds of depressing. Under this view, it can be extremely dangerous to study anything one does not already believe because whatever one studies for whatever reason can have a very negative influence. While it might be interesting to debate or dispute this assumption, I think there is a great positive lesson to be learned as well.<span id="more-7032"></span></p>
<p>If we are drawn toward the &#8220;wrong&#8221; things by studying them, we can also be drawn to the &#8220;right&#8221; things by studying them. If we want to be more drawn to our Judaism, we can jumpstart ourselves by studying Torah. It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything specific, it can be anything. I think a lot of people study things that they don&#8217;t enjoy and that causes them to want to study less. We would be wise to broaden the scope of what we study as a collective unit and give more people more opportunities to find things they enjoy studying. One doesn&#8217;t have to study the familiar texts. Study whatever Jewish texts you want. It seems that when one learns about anything, one is drawn toward that thing. We want to be more drawn to our Judaism. Let&#8217;s study.</p>
<p>Studying Torah is valuable for so many reasons. This just seems like another side benefit.</p>
<p>This is the most important thing we can do to keep ourselves, children, and communities on the path of Judaism. Study. We are the People of the Book and it is our duty to study and know the Book. Judaism requires us to be knowledgeable. But learning about Judaism seems like good advice anyway, even for people who are already quite observant. We should study things that we want to be drawn toward. Study Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7022" alt="1776" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Lag B&#8217;Omer is on Sunday. This means the entire State of Israel (and many Jewish areas around the world) will be lit with bonfires, the city of Safed and Meron will host thousands of pilgrims to the grave of R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai, schools will take their students on outings, some people will watch great rabbis shoot a bow and arrow, young boys will get their first haircuts, charity will be given for holy water, and songs will be sung to remember R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai. This is all aside from all proliferation of bogus Lag B&#8217;Omer segulos that bombard us.</p>
<p>These are all Lag B&#8217;Omer traditions that are a part of our culture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all great fun and all, and I don&#8217;t mean to rain on anyone&#8217;s parade (or bonfire) but we do need to question whether these activities are appropriate.<span id="more-7021"></span></p>
<p>Lag B&#8217;Omer is a very recent holiday. It&#8217;s not in the Mishna, Talmud, Geonim, Rishonim, Shulchan Aruch, or Rema. Because it is not found in our traditional books and sources, it is worth thinking about the contemporary celebrations of Lag B&#8217;Omer in the broad context of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>If I would tell you that there is a holiday where people make a pilgrimage to a tomb, light bonfires, dance around the fires, give money for holy water, sing songs about a great man, and make a religious ceremony out of a haircut, would you think that sounded like a traditional Jewish holiday? It wouldn&#8217;t to me. To me it sounds a bit pagan.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that it doesn&#8217;t sound familiar to the Jewish ear, because it is a new holiday which was certainly influenced by outside factors.</p>
<p>There are many halachic concerns regarding some of these practices. Just because they are done, does not mean they are right. Certainly it is possible to participate in all the Lag B&#8217;Omer fun and excitement without violating halacha. But it is not an easy task. If anyone starts to think that R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai is praying on their behalf, that could be idol worship. Or if someone venerates R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai as a spiritual power, that could be idol worship. If the haircuts at three years old at a tomb are borrowed from idol worship, it&#8217;s a problem. If giving money for holy water is a borrowed from Christianity, it&#8217;s a problem. Relying on charms and magic is a problem.</p>
<p>So you see, it&#8217;s not so simple to celebrate the new holiday of Lag B&#8217;Omer.</p>
<p>But the most important question we have to ask ourselves is why are we celebrating Lag B&#8217;Omer in this manner? How did this happen? How did it come to be that a holiday which was invented in the last few hundreds years has become a very religiously significant event? So much so that people will read this post and wonder if I am orthodox? How did this happen?</p>
<p>And one last question: Should R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai really be our biggest rabbinic hero? See this post on DovBear for more that: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/05/mitzvoth-not-magic-or-what-about-r.html">Mitzvoth not magic: Or what about R. Yehuda?</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but I don&#8217;t think we will like the answer if we ever find out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6883" alt="Stout_Fox_and_Sage_Hedgehog" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Stout_Fox_and_Sage_Hedgehog-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" />One of the books I am reading now is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159420411X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=159420411X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail  but Some Don&#8217;t</a> by Nate Silver. It&#8217;s an excellent book and I highly recommend it. Perhaps a full review of the book will find its way onto the blog. In the meantime, I want to explore something Silver mentions in the book.</p>
<p>While talking about the general buffoonery of political pundits in the media, Silver notes that people are drawn to bombastic, all-encompassing predictions and most people are not very impressed with nuanced, unsure predictions. He doesn&#8217;t say this in the book, but that&#8217;s why Rush Limbaugh is so popular. He says everything with an air of absolute authority. Whether he right or wrong plays no role in how many people judge him. Subconsciously, we are all very impressed with someone who is assertive and unequivocal. When someone tries to explain why things are not so simple, we get bored and lose interest.</p>
<p>To illustrate this phenomena, Silver draws upon the well known poem &#8220;The Hedgehog and the Fox.&#8221; Isaiah Berlin wrote the poem in 1953 but it just as relevant today as it was then. The poem divides the great thinkers of the world into two categories.</p>
<p><span id="more-6882"></span></p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;hedgehogs, who view the world through the lens of a single defining idea (examples given include Plato, Lucretius, Dante, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Ibsen, and Proust) and foxes who draw on a wide variety of experiences and for whom the world cannot be boiled down to a single idea (examples given include Herodotus, Aristotle, Erasmus, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Molière, Goethe, Pushkin, Balzac, Joyce, Anderson).</em></p>
<p>Silver contends that most of us are hedgehogs and we like hedgehogs, especially in the media. People like soundbites and hedgehogs produce soundbites, Foxes do not. Silver advises us to try to be more like foxes and see nuance. Nothing is as simple as hedgehogs make it seem.</p>
<p>When I read this part of the book I thought about the state of orthodox Judaism and Judaism in general today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve become very hedgehog-ish. By that I mean that we are dogmatic and tend to oversimplify great issues. Take the way many secular Jews think abuot orthodox Jews, it&#8217;s not nuanced, it&#8217;s based on stereotypes, and is usually not accurate. Take the way orthodox Jews think about secular Jews, it&#8217;s not nuanced, it&#8217;s based on old tropes, and is usually not very accurate.</p>
<p>When it comes to issues within the orthodox Jewish community, we do the same. Everything and everyone is labeled. Issues are called crises. Leaders are oftentimes quoted in simplistic terms without regard for specific situations and circumstances.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the &#8220;crisis&#8221; of people from orthodox homes leaving orthodox Judaism. People are looking for the &#8220;reason&#8221; or the &#8220;solution&#8221; but things are not so simple. I know many people who left orthodox Judaism. They all have their own story, their own reasons, and their own lives. There is no one reason. There is no one solution. But as hedgehogs, we think there should be one. To me, the only solution to this issue is to view people as people with choices and sometimes people make choices we are not happy with. Our job is to provide every orthodox child the opportunity to thrive. Do we do that? I don&#8217;t think so. Can we do that? Maybe not. The point is that it&#8217;s complicated. People want to hear a simple sound bite that will solve everything. Many speakers and writers try to do that. But in the end, it&#8217;s all foam with no beer. It all sounds good, but each individual situation needs specific attention. There is no silver bullet.</p>
<p>The people we tend to hear are people that proclaim that there is a unified theory to answer our questions. The people that get the biggest platforms are the ideologues with a single position approach to whatever they are asked. Chasidus and chumros are popular now because it&#8217;s easier to just buy into a system of extremism. It&#8217;s hedgehoggery at its finest.</p>
<p>But orthodox Judaism is complex. It&#8217;s okay to have questions and it&#8217;s okay to sense tension and contradictions. That&#8217;s where beauty is found. Pundits are popular, but they are fleeting. They have their time in the sun. Beauty and pleasure come from more nuanced and sophisticated views. It&#8217;s like the difference between a hotdog and a masterfully prepared steak. Sure the hotdog tastes good. But one who appreciates finer things wants to enjoy the complexity of an excellent steak.</p>
<p>We should not settle for simplistic approaches to anything, and certainly not orthodox Judaism. Let&#8217;s not expect everything to fit into a neat and tidy box with a ribbon and a bow. Life is complicated. Judaism is complicated. Let&#8217;s seek out the most nuanced and sophisticated positions within orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Returning to ideas secular Jews and orthodox Jews have about one another for a moment. Is anything ever so simple? Let&#8217;s take the time to become more familiar with one another. We should strive to understand and appreciate each other. If we approach life more like foxes, we are bound to understand more about the world and the people around us. I think that would wonderful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6654" alt="270209_reachingout" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/270209_reachingout-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />We&#8217;ve covered Klal Perspectives here before. I think we will follow the same format as we did last time. I am going to highlight the one good article that I read in the journal in this post. Hopefully next week I will write my response to the Questions in this Klal Perspectives issue.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Klal Perspectives, here is the intro from my post on the previous issue:</p>
<p><em>Klal Perspectives is a great journal of articles written by orthodox Jewish rabbis and writers. The difference between Klal Perspectives and other journals is basically the content. KP is not a halacha journal. It is a practical journal.</em></p>
<p><em>The articles are not about well researched, fine nuances of Jewish law. The articles are about the issues that the orthodox community is facing and how to deal with them. Because the articles are not academic, they appeal to more people and more people are capable of writing articles for the journal. In a pleasing development, several articles have been authored by women. Lay-people are also featured as writers.</em></p>
<p>The issue being handled in this issue is Kiruv. The questions are pretty specific but the goal is to discuss <em>&#8220;varying approaches to outreach currently being pursued, and the appropriateness of the current allocation of communal resources as among these alternative strategies and focuses.&#8221;<span id="more-6653"></span></em></p>
<p>The journal does not agree upon a definition for the word Kiruv but I think they generally define it as bringing non-orthodox Jews to mitzvah observance.</p>
<p>Honestly, the responses that I read were pretty depressing. The articles did not really answer the questions that they were asked to answer. This is somewhat typical of Kiruv in general, as the entire field is not really very into using data and statistics. There were barely any footnotes in the articles I read. To me, this means that the writers are writing from their hearts and minds, but not from a place of hard data. That&#8217;s fine, but it is qualitatively different than well researched writing. Most of the articles I read sounded more like sermons, or divrei Torah than journal articles. That&#8217;s also fine, but I think that reflects poorly on the Kiruv field. Yet, it rings true to my ears, in the sense that the Kiruv profession, for better or worse, is not really about data, numbers, efficiency of resources, or other more modern metrics.</p>
<p>None of the articles I read actually discussed the issues of proving God&#8217;s existence or the veracity of the Torah. One article acknowledged the challenges of Biblical Criticism, but said nothing about how to meet the challenge. It&#8217;s almost as if the Kiruv professionals who wrote articles are not aware that belief in God and Torah from Sinai is not as easy as it sounds. Perhaps, the reason Kiruv seems to be floundering is because we can&#8217;t get past first base!</p>
<p>One article stood out. Rabbi Ilan Feldman wrote more about the orthodox Jewish community than about Kiruv per se, but his observations are right on the money.</p>
<p>His basic point is that the success of orthodox Judaism actually harms Kiruv. Our communities are large, intimidating, and have become focused on observance above being what he calls &#8220;model communities&#8221;. We are more careful about chumros and precision in halacha and hashkafa that it detracts from our appeal. Further, our success permits untrue stereotypes about our non-orthodox comrades to develop and reach levels of acceptance that they are considered normal.</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman relates a powerful story about the time he joined a mission of Federation style Jews (read = non-orthodox) as a way of trying to build a bridge between the respective communities. Throughout the trip he had to make many sacrifices and concessions all while not getting offended by the ignorance of orthodox Judaism exhibited throughout the trip. By the end of the trip his trip-mates warmed up to him and they had great conversations while getting to know each other pretty well. He felt that he was successful in dispelling many of the unfair or erroneous assumptions about orthodox Judaism by going on the trip.</p>
<p>This is not an unfamiliar script. It happens all the time. But the part that hit home for me, and elicited a tear in the corner of my eye was this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But the one who was most transformed on that trip was me.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What I expected to encounter was a group of 200 Jews devoid of feelings for Israel or religion. What I discovered instead were 200 very religious, spiritual, passionately devoted, proud Jews who knew very little about Torah and who lacked a Jewish vocabulary, but who loved their Jewish brethren in Israel, respected holiness and possessed a passion for Judaism as they knew it that rivaled the passion I had seen in my frum friends. In short, I learned to respect them. And I learned that “secular” Jews are often very religious Jews who do not know ritual, and whose devotion and willingness to sacrifice for the Judaism they do know is inspiring. By the time we parted ways, I actually loved them. Once I made this discovery, I was both surprised and embarrassed that it was new to me.</em></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is so true. In some orthodox circles, the non-orthodox are heathen, God hating, anti-Semites. This is a lie. Maybe part of why Kiruv has become so hard is because they know what we think of them&#8230;</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman then returns to the point about our communities focusing more on observance than being models. When combined with our arrogance about our own observance our ignorance about non-orthodox Jews creates this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Picture an emotionally and financially secure, successful, well-educated head of household who lives in a world in which wisdom is respected, volunteering over the weekend is considered a wonderful way to spend one’s time, wholesome family activities on Saturday afternoon are seen as a healthy way of building character. Ask him to join a world in which routine Shabbos-table talk argues in favor of Torah by disparaging secular wisdom, in which political candidates are assessed purely on selfish concerns of the religious community, with little concern for their impact on broader society. Not only is this sort of talk distinctly unattractive, it is not the talk of giants; it obscures the sense of responsibility, compassion and awe for G-d’s children that Avraham Avinu left as his legacy to his descendants.</em></p>
<p>Again. Wow.</p>
<p>But it is true. Orthodox Jews are led to believe that non-orthodox Jews and non-Jews are flailing about in the God-forsaken secular world. They are up the creek without a paddle. If only they would see the beauty of orthodox Judaism, they would be like thirsty camels drinking from the cool waters of our oasis of Torah. But that&#8217;s not the way it is. People are doing just fine without religion, and we are not always doing just fine with religion. We need to change how we view them and more importantly we need to change ourselves.</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman offers a hopeful alternative vision.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Orthodox Jews would be sufficiently secure with their own Yiddishkeit to invite their neighbors and co-workers to their homes, because the language of fear will have been replaced by a language of connection and confidence. Orthodox Jews would lead lives of idealism that extend beyond their own religious needs, inevitably becoming role models and attractive examples of lifestyle to non-observant Jews. Families will make life decisions informed by the religious needs of Klal Yisrael, not exclusively their own. Young couples will be recognized as an invaluable resource in a battle for the spiritual lives of all Jews, and will be encouraged to choose where to reside based upon where their presence would most greatly enhance Judaism, rather than merely their own religious comforts.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Because Orthodoxy would authentically and profoundly respect people, Orthodox community leaders would develop a reputation for selfless devotion to the good of the broader community, rather than solely parochial interests. For example, communal leadership will be invested in ensuring strong public schools in their neighborhoods, even though their own constituencies attend only yeshivas.</em></p>
<p>Notice the subtle criticism of the orthodox establishment? I honestly think this criticism is spot on. But there is hope. In Rabbi Feldman&#8217;s opinion, with the proper attitudes in place, we become a more attractive destination for passionate Judaism among the non-orthodox. I agree. This is what it would look like:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Non-observant Jews will be welcomed by their frum neighbors in both large frum communities as well as in evolving frum neighborhoods, and frum Jews will be more than welcome into their neighborhoods by the non-Orthodox, eruv and all, because Orthodox people would be known to be ideal neighbors: friendly, non-judgmental, and interested in the needs of others.</em></p>
<p>We can dream, right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6606" title="furnace-fire" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>In Parshas Vayeshev we read the story of Tamar and Yehuda. Tamar is suspected of being harlot and following her conviction, she is sentenced to death by burning. Instead of exonerating herself by outing Yehuda, she accepts her fate and merely produces some evidence that shows Yehuda surreptitiously that he was the one who was with her.</p>
<p>The Talmud says that this teaches us that it is better to be burned alive in a fiery furnace than to embarrass one&#8217;s friend in public.</p>
<p>Tosafos ask the obvious question: If one must die in a fiery furnace rather than embarrass one&#8217;s friend, it should be included with the three cardinal sins of Judaism for which a Jew is required to give up one&#8217;s life? Those are murder, adultery, and idol worship. If embarrassing a friend must be avoided at the cost of death &#8211; it is equal to those three! Why is it omitted from the list?</p>
<p>Tosafos answer that only things that are explicit in the Torah are included in the list.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah infers that Tosafos mean that one is in fact required to give up one&#8217;s life to spare a friend embarrassment. Meaning that halachically there is no<em> </em>leeway. One must give up one&#8217;s life in order that one&#8217;s friend not be embarrassed.</p>
<p>This does not make the Torah Temimah happy.<span id="more-6604"></span> He says &#8220;if not for their words I think&#8230;&#8221; which is rabbinic code for &#8220;I very respectfully disagree&#8221;. Instead the Torah Temimah says (translation mine) that it is clear that one cannot include embarrassing a friend in the list of three cardinal sins. Rather he says that the Talmud was teaching <em>mussar</em> and good etiquette. One who does not heed the advice of the rabbis of the Talmud is not a called a <em>rasha,</em> rather he is just a person with bad character. Whereas with the three cardinal sins, the law actually requires one to martyr oneself rather than sin. One who violates one of those sins is a <em>rasha</em> and it is as if he violated the basic tenets of faith.</p>
<p>I think the significant thing here is not so much that the Torah Temimah has a different answer than Tosafos. The bomb here is that the Torah Temimah is willing to tame an extreme statement of Chazal and call it <em>mussar </em>instead of taking it literally. Tosafos did not do that. Many charedim today do not do that. But the Torah Temimah was willing to reinterpret an extreme statement of Chazal and say it was not halachic, rather it was a sermonic point that was designed to urge people to act properly without setting actual parameters of legal ramifications.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/562.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6551" title="562" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/562-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" /></a>Yoram Hazony wrote a very interesting article for the NY Times Opinionator Blog. I am big fan of Yoram Hazony and I really like his original thinking.</p>
<p>In his article he attempts to address the perfection of God.</p>
<p>The familiar view to orthodox Jews today is that God is All-Knowing, All-Powerful, and All-Good. Hazony makes two primary arguments against this view. One is that it&#8217;s fairly evident Jewish thought on this has evolved. The God the Bible seems to be more limited than the God we talk about today (and have talked about for at least 2000 years). Second, there are philosophical problems with calling God &#8220;All-Everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>The great rabbis of post-Biblical Judaism have done an incredible job of interpreting the passages in the Bible that seem to limit God. Yet, even some of the medieval commentators were comfortable with an anthropomorphic God. This idea has completely fallen out of favor and is now considered heresy almost unanimously.</p>
<p>But we are less adept at dealing with the philosophical concerns of an &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God. Here there are newer issues that arise out of a better understanding of the world. Perfect is now understood in terms of balances. It is not understood as unlimited quantities of stuff. Further, to assert perfection requires us to have a complete vision of God. We don&#8217;t. God obscures Himself and even God&#8217;s favorite prophet Moses only caught a glimpse of God from the rear.</p>
<p>So Hazony proposes that we resurrect the idea of an imperfect God.<span id="more-6550"></span> The idea is that we hope that God will deal with us faithfully and there is justice. This creates a more true relationship with a more realistic God.</p>
<p>But the reason this idea has fallen out of favor, Hazony proposes, is because philosophers and religious leaders recognize that it is much more powerful to believe in the &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God than the imperfect God. Hazony concludes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Instead, they have preferred to speak to us of a God consisting of a series of sweeping idealizations — idealizations whose relation to the world in which we actually live is scarcely imaginable. Today, with theism rapidly losing ground across Europe and among Americans as well, we could stand to reconsider this point. Surely a more plausible conception of God couldn’t hurt.</em></p>
<p>This is the core issue of contemporary orthodox Judaism. Is plausibility and minimalism a better weapon against atheism or is mysticism and maximalism a better tool? The ultra-orthodox camp firmly believes that the key is insularity and an expansion of required beliefs. It asks that their adherents shield themselves from the outside world and empirical evidence. The more progressive orthodox groups embrace the challenges of modernity by looking for less familiar views on God and Judaism that are more compatible with modern thinking. It asks their adherents to work through any potential conflict and accept scientific inquiry and some of its conclusions.</p>
<p>The question raised by Hazony is which track is more likely to produce the desired result of devout believers. It&#8217;s a good question. It&#8217;s a different question that what is most comfortable, or what is easier, or what is more intellectually honest. He is simply asking which track has a better chance of survival.</p>
<p>I think he is correct that eventually it will be nearly impossible to ignore the outside world and the conflicts between it and the more maximalist positions. Granted, there will be contradictions to the minimalist positions as well, but it is easier to swallow a small pill than to swallow a beach ball.</p>
<p>Read Hazony&#8217;s article and join the conversation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Small-Business-Saturday.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6539" title="Small-Business-Saturday" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Small-Business-Saturday-279x300.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="300" /></a>I wasn&#8217;t going to write a post about this so I did a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10101217351998665" target="_blank">short blurb on Facebook</a> (you can read the post and the excellent comments even if you don&#8217;t have Facebook). But the conversation was very enlightening and I have decided to do a post.</em></p>
<p>On Saturday, American Express sponsored Small Business Saturday (SBS). To help promote small businesses (and their brand) AMEX offered a $25 credit to anyone who used a registered AMEX card at a participating small business.</p>
<p>Many schools and charity organizations urged their supporters to register and donate $25 using their AMEX. This would give the institution a $25 (minus fees) donation and the donor would recoup the $25 from AMEX. So in essence it was a free $25 for the institution. Sounds like a win / win.</p>
<p>On its face, the participation of charities and religious institutions seems like it could be an issue. The concept here is to promote small business with purchases. &#8220;Spending $25&#8243; at a shul or school simply for the sake of a donation is  not within the spirit of the promotion. But reasonable people could argue this point.</p>
<p>The problem is that SBS has rules.<span id="more-6538"></span> <a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/0W3T2x183K0j1X3Q2536/amex-sbs-terms-2012.pdf" target="_blank">The rules state</a>:</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Program is only available to qualifying small businesses. For the purpose of this Program, qualifying small businesses include small, locally-owned storefront and online businesses with $10 million in annual revenue or less. Businesses in the following industries are excluded: government agencies, charities, non-profits, trade associations, shopping property management firms, political, religious and educational organizations.</em></p>
<p> It seems pretty clear that shuls, yeshivas, tzedaka organizations, and any other frum (or not frum) Not-For-Profit would not be eligible to participate in SBS. (And by the way, we were able to find a few Churches that asked for $25 donations on SBS).</p>
<p>But things are not so simple.</p>
<p>First of all, AMEX knows which vendors are NFPs or religious institutions. Yet, they accept SBS submissions from these vendors. This seems to be in defiance of their own rules. Further, at least a few institutions contacted AMEX and asked if they were in fact eligible for SBS and AMEX told them that they were eligible! Once again, AMEX defied their own rules. Complicating things even worse is the fact that AMEX told several other institutions that they were not eligible for SBS.</p>
<p>Turns out, AMEX has no idea what they are doing. Different organizations were told different things and they don&#8217;t even know their own rules. So what&#8217;s the verdict?</p>
<p>Here is what I think. If you asked AMEX and they said your organization is not eligible, there is no question that you should not be participating. Yes, that is even if they will accept your charges. Taking advantage of their mistake when you know that they are making a mistake is unethical. Sure, &#8220;<em>taus akum</em>&#8221; is permissible. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should </em>take advantage. And it might only apply after the mistake happened, but to knowingly take advantage of a mistake is different.</p>
<p>If you asked AMEX and they said your organization is eligible and you did not know that their own rules said that your organization was not eligible, I have no problem with your organization participating in SBS. I don&#8217;t love it, but it&#8217;s hard for me to complain.</p>
<p>If you asked AMEX and they said your organization is eligible and you <em>did </em>know that their own rules said that your organization was not eligible, I think you should still refrain from participating in SBS. While it is true that someone at AMEX told you that you could participate, you knew that you could not participate. It seems difficult for me to sign off on that. Just because a call-center agent doesn&#8217;t know AMEX&#8217;s rules doesn&#8217;t exonerate you from following those rules. Imagine one idiot police officer told you that you could drive 80 in a clearly marked 55 MPH zone and another officer pulls you over for speeding. You&#8217;re not going to be able to blame it on the first officer. You&#8217;re going to get a citation. It&#8217;s not the exact same thing, but it&#8217;s close.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t ask AMEX if your organization could participate I think you might think that ignorance is bliss. But it&#8217;s not. If you are going to participate in a promotion like this, especially one that involves free money, you need to do your due diligence. You need to make sure you can participate. If you didn&#8217;t even care to look into it, I find that problematic.</p>
<p>I hope that at the very least, AMEX will clarify their position for SBS 2013 and the halachically conscious public will be sure to ascertain their eligibility before spamming their supporters to &#8220;spend $25&#8243; on a donation to their institution.</p>

Personal Torah libraries in private homes and public Torah libraries in institutions were irreparably damaged by the raging waters.</p>
<p>The Jewish people are the People of the Book and our books are revered. We don&#8217;t simply learn from books, we treat books with respect and (in a non-creepy way), we almost give them the respect an important person would receive. Books are kissed when we put them away, we don&#8217;t leave our books open when we are not studying, we prominently display our books in our homes, we spend time each day studying the books, and when books are no longer able to be used we bury the books. Our books have been burned by our enemies and we cry over those tragedies almost as we would cry over human death. We have burned our own books and we regret those incidents. Our books are precious and we are very aware of their importance in our lives.</p>
<p>A huge number of books were destroyed in the hurricane. They deserved a proper send-off and at Yeshiva Darchei Torah in Far Rockaway the books received an appropriate farewell. The students and rabbis participated in a ceremonial funeral as they sent the books to be buried.<span id="more-6531"></span></p>
<p>The unspoken message to the students and the rabbis and to the rest of us is that our books are the basic building blocks of Judaism. In our books, the words of our Torah scholars live on and in turn they give us life. While Judaism cannot be relegated to an encyclopedia, instead it must be lived and alive. The pursuit of Torah knowledge and expertise in order to live that life is so vital to our success that the books themselves are larger than life. The books deserve our respect and our attention. We can never forget that we are called the people of the book and we must earn the title by doing our very best to know what it says in our books.</p>

You can grin and bear it, move to another country, or secede from the Union. I have not heard of anyone actually getting up and leaving the United States of America in the wake of the election, and I am sure if someone does leave purely for political reasons we will hear about it. Though I wonder where a libertarian of conservative would enjoy living more than in these United States. Is there a country out there with more conservative / liberal balance than America? I don&#8217;t think so. But I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Of course, this is part of the blessing of America. There is always a balance. There are some states that are more liberal than others. There are some states with more conservative values than others. Put it all together and you get an odd mix of values, opinions, and policies that create a great country unlike any other.</p>
<p>The White House has a petition website where one can petition the government for just about anything. If you get 25,000 signatures on your petition, the government guarantees a response. There are now 20 petitions from 20 states requesting that the Federal government allow them to peacefully secede from the United States of America so that they can form their own little country.<span id="more-6465"></span></p>
<p>Aside from the logistical problems of turning a state into a country and the oft ignored fact that the Federal government gives millions of dollars to the states, conservatives and liberals would be wise to oppose these shenanigans.</p>
<p>First of all, asking to secede after losing an election is the very definition of being a sore loser. It&#8217;s like the kid who takes his ball home after his team loses and doesn&#8217;t let the next team play.</p>
<p>But it is much more than that. Part of what America great is the diversity of its population. We are a nation of immigrants and though we Americans do not share a common ancestry or heritage we share common dreams. We pride ourselves on the great opportunity that awaits the huddled masses from wherever they come.</p>
<p>One of the great checks and balances built into our country is the political system where conservatives and liberals and everyone in between has a voice in government and ideally our government represents the best of both sides of the spectrum.</p>
<p>It would be a disaster if our country lost its great diversity and political balance due to secession. Now I know that these petitions are silly and reactionary. But I just think that if we would appreciate our country for what it is, we would not see attempts to secede after losing an election. We need to be proud of our system and if we want to change things but have been rebuffed we need to adjust strategy or tactics, not take our ball and run away.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about Jewish institutions. The Jewish people are also a nation of immigrants and huddled masses. Although in contrast to America, we do share common ancestry and heritage which makes us even more connected to one another. Part of what makes us great is our diversity. We are proud that there are so many different kinds of Jews. People to the left of us and people to the right of us may disagree on substance and style, but we are still brothers and sisters. For that reason alone we must do everything we can to identify with one another. We cannot afford secessions. Debate, dispute, disagreement, dialogue &#8211; those we can handle. But we cannot tolerate a group seceding from Judaism nor can we ostracize a group so much that we create a secession by default.</p>
<p>Our differences are our strength. It&#8217;s not easy to understand or empathize with people on the opposite of an ideology. But it is the sign of strength, not weakness, when we do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6377" title="family" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family-300x208.gif" alt="" width="300" height="208" /></a>A bunch of people sent this video my way. They all suggested I watch the video and they all felt the video was very powerful. I needed to find 30 minutes to watch it. This morning I had an opportunity to watch it and I must say that I wholeheartedly agree with them.</p>
<p>The video is a student project (read: not very professionally produced) but sometimes simplicity is the most pure form of art. It is a documentary that tells the story of three daughters, maybe three and a half daughters, of prominent religious Zionist rabbis in Israel. I am not familiar with too many religious Zionist rabbis but I have heard of all three of these rabbis.</p>
<p>Each of the daughters is no longer as observant as her family. The film explores that tension in a very real way.<span id="more-6375"></span></p>
<p>In my opinion, the film is not about rabbis and daughter. Only one of the daughters seems to have been particularly affected by the fact that her father was a prominent rabbi. The other two could have just as easily been daughters of any orthodox family.</p>
<p>I trust you&#8217;ll watch the video when you have the time and I am sure you will have your own reactions.</p>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts on the video.</p>
<p>The fathers come off really well. I am sure it was not always so pleasant growing up as a rebellious daughter of a prominent rabbi. Yet they are portrayed at loving, down to earth, and genuinely concerned about their daughters. Especially Rav Aviner.</p>
<p>The daughters all seem really artistic, artsy even. I think this is a very important point. Of all the personality types that might not be compatible with orthodox Judaism, I think the artsy type could be the most difficult. Artsy types, and I know this is a generalization, value and crave independence. Freedom of expression and thought is a large part of what makes people artistic. Conforming to orthodox Judaism is hard for artsy types if they are born into it. A lot of Baalei Teshuva are artsy for the opposite reason. They left their homes and expressed themselves via orthodox Judaism. But I think it is still fair to say that the artistic Baalei Teshuva are non-conformist orthodox Jews. I think that is great. But we need to find more opportunities for artsy types who are born into orthodox Judaism, especially for young women.</p>
<p>Thinking about this from a rabbinic perspective was interesting. First of all, I am the son of a rabbi. My experience actually somewhat mirrored the one daughter (Bigman) whose experience was rabbi-centric. She was &#8220;more orthodox&#8221; than her peers as a child. I had a similar experience. My father was the principal of a modern orthodox school and we had higher religious standards than almost all of my friends. It was not easy for me either. Going to high school at Ner Israel almost turned that upside down as many of my peers had more religious homes than mine. Perhaps they balanced each other out. But I was able to relate to her struggle very much.</p>
<p>I am also the father of two sons of a rabbi. I know that it can sometimes be challenging for them to be the son of a rabbi. But in this respect, I don&#8217;t see their experience mirroring that of the daughters all that much at this point. I am not a super famous rabbi who is called away from his family too often. I feel more like a regular dad who happens to be a rabbi. But the video certainly illustrated the fears that I have in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>I am sure that some people will watch this video and attribute the issues these daughters have to their more open religious Zionist lifestyle. They will blame this philosophy for these rabbis&#8217; daughters leaving orthodox Judaism. This is burying one&#8217;s head deep into the sand. Amongst every kind of orthodox Judaism there are people who leave. There are daughters of every single kind of rabbi out there who have left orthodox Judaism. It is not a new phenomena either. It is a part of our heritage and history. I really hope that people don&#8217;t come away from this video and see it is a justification for living any other form of Judaism as a protection against this.</p>
<p>The most important thing about this video to me, is that it raises the issue of how to deal with children who are not following our personal choices. It can be extremely challenging for a parent when a child reject their way of life. Sometimes rejection is absolute. The parents are orthodox and the child is secular. Sometimes it is far less absolute. The parents are chasidic or very yeshivish and the child is modern. Or the parents are modern and the children are ultra-orthodox. These can sometimes be very challenging situations as well.</p>
<p>I think that it is very important that the parent / child relationship not depend on religious observance. It is hurtful to parents when children diverge from their parents&#8217; way of life. But that pain cannot be more prominent than the love of a parent for a child and a child for a parent.</p>
<p>Every child needs to feel accepted by their parents. Every child needs to know that they are loved for who they are even if they are doing things which parents do not approve.</p>
<p>In so many of our prayers and remarks around the High Holidays we note that despite our failings God loves us unconditionally. We need to be able to follow the lead of God on this one. If God can do it, we need to at least try.</p>
<p>Not everyone works the same way and not everyone can be exactly the same. We need to find a place in our communities and even in our families for different forms of expression. Sometimes those forms of expression may be in accordance with halacha, and sometimes they might be at odds with halacha. While the orthodox community cannot condone the breaking of halacha, we must understand that it simply does not work for everyone. If we want to have relationships with our friends and family who are not as comfortable in the box, we need to let them know that they can still be loved and accepted despite our religious differences.</p>
<p>Everyone yearns for acceptance. Clearly, in our homes we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. But even in our communities we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. The Jewish people are a family. We have all types and that&#8217;s just fine with us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/newsweek-heaven.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6348" title="newsweek heaven" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/newsweek-heaven-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="300" /></a>Newsweek&#8217;s cover story last week was basically an advertisement for a book written by a doctor who claims to have seen heaven. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/10/07/proof-of-heaven-a-doctor-s-experience-with-the-afterlife.html" target="_blank">According to his personal account</a>, he was in a coma when he saw heaven and met fairies and angels along the way. He is convinced that this was a real place and a real experience and has written a book telling his story.</p>
<p>I have two things to say about this story and they are completely unrelated.</p>
<p>First, the claim in and of itself.</p>
<p>Reading the good doctor&#8217;s narrative is almost as entertaining as it is frustrating. The heaven he visits is coincidentally enough, exactly like a human would imagine it. White puffy clouds, soft soothing voices, lots of love, and he describes it as more &#8220;real&#8221; than the day of his own wedding and birth of his sons. He claims that his brain could not have generated the images or experience because he was in a certain type of coma. The punchline of his claim is that consciousness is independent of brain activity and when we die our consciousness lives on in a perfect world. He adds that since he was a skeptical Christian it must be that this was real because he would not have imagined it on his own.</p>
<p>Obviously, these are very specious claims.</p>
<p><span id="more-6347"></span></p>
<p>There is nothing in the article or in his story that carries any weight in convincing a skeptic that heaven exists. This sounds no different than any other fantastic claim. The only difference is that this fellow is a doctor and he seems to think this is a really big deal. As if to say that doctors would never believe in something without evidence and therefore he should be taken more seriously than a clergyman with the same claims.</p>
<p>An appeal to authority if I ever saw one.</p>
<p>I am not a neuroscientist. But Sam Harris is a neuroscientist and he debunks the sloppy science of the article. Read that here (this article safe for <em>ma&#8217;aminim bnei ma&#8217;aminim)</em> <a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/this-must-be-heaven" target="_blank">SamHarris.org</a>.</p>
<p>The more interesting question to me is what an orthodox Jew should think about this story.</p>
<p>Due to a fairly recent shift in political alignment and ideology, more and more orthodox Jews find themselves copacetic with fundamentalist Christians. There are many shared beliefs and ideals between the two groups thus creating a feeling of &#8220;what&#8217;s good for them is good for us&#8221; among orthodox Jews. That might be true sometimes. Some people think it is true all of the time.</p>
<p>This story is an example of where we must diverge. If orthodox Judaism is correct, and we believe it is, this doctor&#8217;s account must be wrong. We don&#8217;t believe in ethereally lovely looking women who make us fall in love with them as we float toward a place that teaches, “You have nothing to fear. There is nothing you can do wrong.” We disagree. We do have something to fear and we can do things that are wrong. We are supposed to fear God and God&#8217;s judgment and we can do things wrong. Our job is to make the right choices. We get judged when we die.If an orthodox Jew believes this account of heaven, the orthodox Jew must also believe our beliefs on the afterlife are wrong. Now certainly there is very little canonized material on the afterlife in Judaism. But there is also an extreme reluctance among orthodox Jews to discard cherished beliefs, even if they are not mandatory beliefs.</p>
<p>So, this article is an affront to orthodox Judaism and all non-Christians. We don&#8217;t accept their view of heaven by virtue of our own appeal to authority. It does not help our cause to promote this article nor does it present anything of value to the orthodox Jew. I read it as an advertisement for a man&#8217;s book that he believes is true but that&#8217;s only because he has been fooled by his own religion and hyperactive subconscious.</p>
<p>I hope Newsweek is being compensated well for this advertisement for a book and for Christianity because they completely sold out.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, as a I noted on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10101148965805145" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, Newsweek&#8217;s print edition is dying at the end of 2012, maybe this was they moment in the foxhole where they decided to believe in heaven&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ObamaSilvermanAd_6721738.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6330" title="ObamaSilvermanAd_6721738" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ObamaSilvermanAd_6721738-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>As far as I know, Rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt is a lovely fellow. Unfortunately, he ran into some trouble over the last few days. <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/dear-sarah-silverman/2012/10/11/0/" target="_blank">After he published an open letter to Sarah Silverman in the Jewish Press</a>, and Sarah&#8217;s father responded quite forcefully in the comments, Jezebel found the whole thing more than a bit entertaining and made Rabbi Rosenblatt look like a moron.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Sarah Silverman is a Jewish comic. She is crude, not really that funny in my opinion, and only mildly entertaining when she is not trying to be too shocking. She did a little YouTube video telling black, Latino, old, and young people to make sure they register to vote. The title of the video is &#8220;Let my people vote&#8221;. The video is crude and as per usual full of colorful language. But the message is completely innocuous. Her message is to register to vote, or at least to get a firearm license. I think we all agree that registering to vote is a message we can all get behind.</p>
<p>Rabbi Rosenblatt takes offense to Sarah Silverman&#8217;s very existence it seems, but his excuse for writing his &#8220;open letter&#8221; to her is because the title of her video was &#8220;framed in biblical language&#8221;. For the life of me, I cannot comprehend how using a phrase that is based on a loosely translated verse from the bible is sufficient cause to rant against someone, but apparently it works for Rabbi Rosenblatt.</p>
<p>The rant speaks for itself. It is an anti-feminist, pro-baby making diatribe. I am not going to comment further on the appropriateness of his comment that Sarah Silverman should just have some babies already and stop worrying about politics. You can read it and the comments for yourself.<span id="more-6329"></span></p>
<p>All the publicity surrounding this letter is definitely not good PR for Jews and certainly a stain on the already suffering public reputation of orthodox Jews. Even if Sarah Silverman would have read the letter and decided that Rabbi Rosenblatt was correct in everything he said, it seems dubious to assume that this letter would be a <em>kiddush Hashem </em>of some sort. That&#8217;s another discussion as well.</p>
<p>What I do want to discuss is the theological underpinning of Rabbi Rosenblatt&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>The first theological statement is this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>You have made a career making public that which is private, making crude that which is intimate, making sensual that which is spiritual. You have experienced what traditional Judaism taught long ago: when you make sex a public thing it loses its potency. When the whisper is replaced with a shout there is no magic to speak about. And, in my opinion, Sarah, that is why you have had trouble forging a permanent relationship – the most basic desire of the feminine soul.</em></p>
<p>Both men and women have a basic desire to forge deep relationships. I am not sure if either men or women want to forge a permanent relationship so badly that it could be called the most basic desire. But more importantly, I know of no reason to connect one&#8217;s willingness to keep intimacy private with one&#8217;s ability to create a relationship. But most importantly, Sarah Silverman has had some pretty long term relationships in her life already. Kudos to her. Just because she hasn&#8217;t tied the knot doesn&#8217;t mean she can&#8217;t attempt to make a permanent relationship. Dating is not permanent. Relationships are not permanent. Marriage is not permanent either.</p>
<p>Then this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As an Orthodox rabbi, I disagree with just about everything you say, but respect your right to say it. All I ask, respectfully, is that you not use traditional Jewish terminology in your efforts. Because doing so is a lie.</em></p>
<p>The issue at stake here is whether one should register to vote. I am unsure why Rabbi Rosenblatt would disagree with this. As I said earlier, I see no reason Sarah Silverman should refrain from using traditional Jewish terminology. It&#8217;s not offensive to use &#8220;Let my people vote&#8221; as a take off on &#8220;Let my people go.&#8221; I don&#8217;t see how it can be. It certainly is not a lie.</p>
<p>And finally this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Marriage and children will change the way you see the world. It will allow you to appreciate the stability that Judaism, the religion of your ancestors, espouses. And it will allow you to understand and appreciate the traditional lifestyle’s peace, security, and respect for human dignity&#8230;</em></p>
<p> Marriage and children definitely change the way one sees the world. But I find it offensive to presume that only a married parent can find their way in Judaism. Anyone can appreciate Judaism. You don&#8217;t need to be married and a parent. God does not even require women to get married or have children in the Torah. Why does Rabbi Rosenblatt?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE </strong>(thanks to Rabbi Bronstein in the comments for helping me to see this): One more thing. It speaks to a grave misapprehension regarding mental illness and motherhood to suggest that a depressed woman have children to cure her depression. Is Rabbi Rosenblatt taking responsibility for the welfare of Sarah Silverman&#8217;s children? Depression is real. And there is an archaic attitude toward depression in the frum community that somehow thinks that having children is the cure for everything from marital issues to depression. Not good.</p>
<p>Personally, I think a public apology and retraction is in order. I see no justification for the letter nor do I see any justification for the theology behind the letter. I hope Rabbi Rosenblatt does the right thing. Hopefully it can begin to heal the wounds created by his open letter.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warning: There is plenty of strong adult language in the comments on the Jewish Press site and only more on Jezebel and even more yet in the video in question.</em></strong></p>

At the time of this posting, the article is the most read article on The Crimson website. Apparently, this fellow was extremely disappointed that the Hillel at Harvard didn&#8217;t mirror his personal views on Judaism.</p>
<p>Hillel is a non-denominational Jewish organization on college campuses across the country. The flavor of each Hillel reflects the staff and students who comprise the Jewish community of each specific campus. No two Hillels are the same.<span id="more-6316"></span></p>
<p>The incident that set off Daniel J. Solomon was a Friday night dinner where Solomon claims most of the attendees were Orthodox or Ultra-Orthodox Jews. Apparently Mr. Solomon has discovered the Lakewood Yeshiva contingent at Harvard. I kid. Mr. Solomon, there are no Ultra-Orthodox Jews at Harvard. Going to Harvard disqualifies one consideration as an Ultra-Orthodox Jew. This is a significant misstatement because Mr. Solomon makes another similar error when he describes Modern Orthodox Jews and Ultra-Orthodox Jews as only cosmetically different. That&#8217;s not true at all. It&#8217;s not just narcissism of small differences. There is a soft racism in grouping &#8220;other people&#8221; into one category. Especially when the groups are so different. One group values insularity and the other group values engagement. It&#8217;s like saying the difference between University of Phoenix and Harvard University is only cosmetic.</p>
<p>But the flaws in Mr. Solomon&#8217;s article go much deeper and speak to a broader anti-religious bias.</p>
<p>When Reform and Conservative Judaism were launched they were clearly deviations from Orthodox Judaism. They defined themselves by how unorthodox they were. That was fun for a while. But eventually the numbers dwindled. Recently, there has been a huge uptick in returning to ritual and tradition within the non-orthodox community. There is a surge of Talmud study and a generation of non-orthodox Jews who value kashrut, tefilin, blessings, and rituals central to orthodox Judaism. Mr. Solomon doesn&#8217;t like this. Not one bit. He wants a return to the most non-traditional forms of Judaism. In his mind, f it is not completely revolutionary, what&#8217;s the point? This seems completely contrary to the trend within non-orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Next, Hillel is a pluralistic organization. It is meant for all Jews. If the numbers indicate that orthodox Judaism is the dominant force, it seems entirely reasonable that the Hillel would conform to the needs of orthodox Jewish students. In other schools the Hillel feels much more Reform or Conservative. That&#8217;s just the way it is. To publish a screed against Hillel because it does not match one&#8217;s personal Judaism missing the entire point of Hillel. It speaks to a certain time of immaturity where one expects everything to be just as one wants it.</p>
<p>The most offensive part of the article is where Mr. Solomon paints orthodox Jews with the broadest of coarse brushes when he says: <em>&#8220;the Orthodox busy themselves more with medieval concepts like mesirah—a prohibition on ratting out Jews to secular authorities—than with tikkun olam—the Jewish idea of social justice.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>While I am a critic of the concern for <em>mesirah</em> in our communities (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira (The Jewish Informant) in Halacha</a>), I think this is an extreme exaggeration that serves to support a stereotype and is borne out of ignorance (or hatred) not truth. <em>Mesirah</em> comes up every now and then, but no one is &#8220;busy&#8221; with it. Further, most secular Jews are not &#8220;busy&#8221; with Tikkun Olam. Most orthodox Jews are involved in studying Torah, many are involved in <em>chessed </em>projects and programs, all give significant dollars to charity. To characterize orthodox Jews as busy with <em>mesirah </em>is to perpetuate a nasty stereotype that is without basis. (I do submit that to many orthodox Jews, <em>mesirah </em>takes precedence over protection children from abuse and purging dishonesty from our communities. This is abhorrent, but hardly defines the community.) But more importantly, the orthodox Jews at Harvard hardly match this stereotype. The orthodox Jews I know who attended Harvard are among the most progressive and &#8220;non-medieval&#8221; orthodox Jews I know. Maybe Mr. Solomon should have talked to some of these purportedly medieval Jews before defining them so crudely in his campus newspaper.</p>
<p>Mr. Solomon concludes that the only way to get more secular Jews into Hillel is to scrap all ritual and tradition. I am sorry, but this is idiotic. Some Hillels are jam packed with secular students and they have not scrapped all ritual and tradition. Jewish students who come to Hillel are there because they identify with their Judaism. Judaism means all kinds of things to all people. But the issue is not what the Hillel does, it is what the Jewish students do and what they feel. Hillel&#8217;s job is not to &#8220;get more secular people in the door&#8221;. Their job is to be there when Jewish students want a Jewish experience. They perform this job somewhat admirably. But it is up to the students to show up.</p>
<p>Mr. Solomon, your screed would have been more well placed if you had called out your fellow Jewish Harvard students for their apathy to their religion. It might be hard for them to get as breathless about eating pork at Hillel as you . Not everyone gets their jollies from shellfish at a Jewish event. Work on increasing Jewish identity and more people will show up at Hillel. It&#8217;s simple.</p>
<p>In the end, I don&#8217;t particularly blame Daniel J. Solomon. He must have got these arcane ideas somewhere. I blame the environment that gave him these values. Maybe the modern orthodox Jews at Harvard can illuminate him and he can bury his hatred for his fellow Jews with his adolescence. Let&#8217;s hope.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/synagogue_during_tora_reading_better_picture.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6308" title="synagogue" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/synagogue_during_tora_reading_better_picture-300x154.png" alt="" width="300" height="154" /></a>I read in the Forward that 1 million American Jews seek identity outside Shul. The purpose of this statistic is a bit lost on me. Sure, many Jews identify as Jewish through their attendance at synagogue. It&#8217;s just that I haven&#8217;t really met anyone like that. Most Jews I meet, whether they are secular, charedi, or somewhere in between consider their Shul as a part of their Jewish identity but I certainly don&#8217;t get the sense that Jewish Americans get their Jewish identity from shul.</p>
<p>But just for fun, let&#8217;s assume the study is a bombshell discovery that very profoundly alters the entire vision of American Judaism. We will assume that the point of the survey was to show that for many American Jews, the synagogue model is not working. As the article in the Forward concludes, quoting Medalon Braun of the Workmen&#8217;s Circle, there is <em>“a real need for a Jewish home for those who do not seek a congregational affiliation.”</em></p>
<p>It seems to me that there are three take-away points that one could make upon reading this discovery and one action item.<span id="more-6307"></span></p>
<p>1) Some people actually <em>do </em>get their Jewish identity from their shuls.</p>
<p>2) The assumption is that if one does not get their Jewish identity inside a synagogue their Jewish identity is in danger of being lost.</p>
<p>3) The people who don&#8217;t go to shul often cannot be categorized as endangered Jews as they are seeking Jewish identity, albeit outside the synagogue.</p>
<p>The action item is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>It seems that there are tons of Jews who want to affiliate Jewishly outside the synagogue. But in my assessment there is a very limited number of such opportunities, especially in a group setting. But institutionalizing these opportunities runs the risk of transferring the shul experience to experiences outside of shul. It is likely that part of the reason these people are looking outside the synagogue is because they are not the type of people who love institutionalized Judaism. Thus, creating institutionalized Judaism outside the shul is probably not going to help.</p>
<p>So what are we to do? How do we appeal to American Jews who specifically do not want to identify with institutionalized Judaism?</p>
<p>Judaism <em>is </em>institutional. On one foot, the best I can think of is Torah study. One can study Torah completely independently. One can study whatever one wants. One can publish their Torah thoughts on their own. In short, Torah study has always been a hallmark of Jewish identity and has served as a counterweight to the institutionalization of shul life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won&#8217;t appeal to everyone. Some people don&#8217;t enjoy studying and learning. However, it has been my experience that when taught properly, anyone can enjoy Torah study. It is possible that non-orthodox Jews think that Torah study is for rabbis and orthodox Jews. But I disagree. It&#8217;s for everyone.</p>
<p>So maybe we don&#8217;t need a new solution. Perhaps the answer is right under our Jewish noses. We are the people of the book. Are we not?</p>
<p>Now accepting additional suggestions&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6262" title="sacks" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>I deeply admire Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks. It is with great interest that I watched his BBC Television program on Science vs. Religion. I really enjoyed it, but found it a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>The premise is that Rabbi Sacks is on a mission to open dialogue with premier British scientists. The production value is high and it is an enjoyable program. (Although I can&#8217;t for the life of me understand why the YouTube video is not in HD and appears squished.) The show is from his perspective. This means that it edited and cut to his liking. This is fine, but it severely limits the objectivity of the show.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch intelligent people talking about important things, but clearly the content is dumbed down for a broad audience.<span id="more-6261"></span></p>
<p>The best segment is the Richard Dawkins segment. Rabbi Sacks challenges Dawkins and Dawkins challenges the Rabbi. Neither of them really answer each other&#8217;s questions. It&#8217;s a little frustrating to the viewer who actually wants to see highly intelligent people debate.</p>
<p>But the value in this video lies not only in the actual questions and answers, its value lies in the acknowledgement that there are questions that science cannot answer and that there are questions that religion cannot answer.</p>
<p>The one thing that bothered me in watching this video how many times scientists challenged Rabbi Sacks about the &#8220;truth&#8221; of Torah and religion and Rabbi Sacks did not answer them with a clear response. I don&#8217;t know if he has a clear response, but there was none in the video.</p>
<p>But there was much to like.</p>
<p>I like how Dawkins differentiates between Darwinism to explain our existence and his refusal to use Social Darwinism to create society. I loved how Rabbi Sacks pounces on this as a way of showing that bad science can be just as damaging as bad religion. Then Rabbi Sacks uses Dawkins&#8217; response to this to show that there is common ground between Religion and Science in that we all share certain values and in those areas we should work together to ensure those mutual goals are met and not foiled by bad religion or bad science. Dawkins is even willing to work together toward common goals.</p>
<p>How many times have I said the same kind of thing with regard to atheism, other religions, secular Judaism, progressive religious Judaism and traditional religious Judaism? I agree with this vehemently. There are many problems that plague us all. Many of the solutions to those problems can be found in religion and science.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sacks ends the program with a soliloquy on the &#8220;power of the conversation&#8221;. This is my mantra as well. The Internet is a place to have that conversation but it must carry over to world of human interaction. We need to enable this kind of conversation as much as we possibly can.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that we need to have the same conversation about science and religion. I mean that we need to have conversations between all of humankind on matters upon which we agree. Those areas are so broad and vast and in those areas we can all contribute. The secular world has much to learn from religion and its values. Religion has much to gain from science. Let&#8217;s not allow our differences to get in the way of progress for mankind.</p>
<p>As we begin a new Jewish year, let us commit to opening dialogue between all people of faiths and creeds for a better tomorrow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RichardJoelHeadshot.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6253" title="RichardJoelHeadshot" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RichardJoelHeadshot-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>Contrary to popular belief, I did not attend Yeshiva University. I&#8217;ve only been there four times in my life. Once for a concert, twice for a video job, and once for the Seforim Sale in 2001 (I bought a Tzidkas HaTzadik and a fancy Mesillas Yesharim). But as I have evolved through my adult years, I have come to learn that I share a considerable amount with YU in many respects.</p>
<p>This is not entirely surprising as the Yeshivas that I attended are not that far off from YU in terms of their overall worldview. With the recent shifts to the right across orthodox Judaism, YU is now very near the style of Judaism in which I was raised.</p>
<p>I was offered the opportunity to interview President Joel as a follow up to his State of the University address which was masterfully delivered at YU last night. President Joel is even better on the phone than he is behind the podium and I really enjoyed our conversation. We discussed a variety of topics that are of interest to the readers of this blog and while I didn&#8217;t transcribe every word of our conversation, I did take notes. What follows is a synopsis of the more compelling parts of our conversation.</p>
<p>What jumped out at me during the State of the University Address was President Joel&#8217;s use of the term Modern Orthodox L&#8217;Chatchila.<span id="more-6251"></span> I too have discussed this topic and am a firm believer that the most perfect Jew is one who is passionate about Torah and scholarship in Torah while being engaged in the outside world. In our conversation, President Joel expanded on this by explaining that Torah U&#8217;Mada can be a very sterile approach. The new approach is Shleimus, the complete person. The idea is that Torah is not supposed to be practiced in an Ir Miklat (city of refuge), it is supposed to be a launching pad. While Torah U&#8217;Mada is part of that philosophy, it became associated with certain apologetics. The modified approach is that Torah U&#8217;Mada is an aspiration, not one specific approach for those who can&#8217;t hack more insular versions of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>This relates to the idea of the Big Tent that President Joel spoke of. There has to be a place for as many people as possible to fit under the tent. In his words, Jews are better at division than multiplication. It&#8217;s a cute line, but also rings true. Although, in my opinion <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/">There is No Tent</a>.</p>
<p>We also discussed the basic dichotomy of insularity vs. engagement. President Joel echoed my thoughts when he described the history of Ashkenazi Jewry. We didn&#8217;t have the option of engagement for most of those years. Our ideal was simply to survive. Survival meant physical and spiritual survival. But President Joel said that the Torah wants us to thrive, not merely survive. Thriving means to engage. There are risks to engagement. The tightrope is difficult to walk. But the view from that tightrope is supremely grand. He compared it to the seven branched menorah with the six lights on the sides pointing toward the middle.</p>
<p>President Joel acknowledged that there are people who leave modern Orthodoxy just like there are people who leave more insular groups. It&#8217;s not a solution as much as an alternative. But the main factors according to President Joel are not philosophy or worldview. The main factors are the home, education, and as he puts it &#8211; mazel. In many respects, society is antithetical to Torah and its values. We need passion and intellectual Judaism to survive that threat.</p>
<p>I told President Joel that even where I come from, the leftmost edge of the yeshiva world, YU is usually a topic of derision. I asked President Joel if he had a message for those on the right that look askance at YU. He began his response by making it very clear that they have respect for the entire Jewish community. To the right and to the left. He invited anyone to come to the Beis Medrash and see that it is comparable to any great yeshiva throughout the world. He said you&#8217;ll find 600 guys learning lishma at night seder. The Roshei Yeshiva are all very significant Torah scholars. They also have degrees. 60% have Masters and 20% have a Ph.D. He volunteered that they don&#8217;t treat Gemara like a college course. Torah is Torah and it is primary. He offered anyone who wants to see it in person to come and wear a mask if they want. But they will see that despite some hashkafic differences, YU is mehadrin when it comes to commitment to Torah learning.</p>
<p>My follow up question was whether YU was doing or considering doing &#8220;kiruv&#8221; on the charedim to try and engage charedim and bring more charedim to YU. He responded that the economic realities are making YU a more attractive option. People need to earn a living now more than ever before and YU gives young people a chance to continue their learning and lay the foundation for a parnassah. Additionally, YUTorah.org gets 75,000 hits a month. Whenever he meets charedim people tell him they love YUTorah.org. Through Torah there is more of a connection than ever before. <a href="http://efink.tumblr.com/post/30917612411/maimonides-is-a-bit-like-a-trojan-horse-of-reason" target="_blank">To borrow a term</a>, YUTorah.org is like the YU Trojan Horse into the charedi world. President Joel is in contact with charedi leaders but he gets the sense that there is not much interest on their part. But he noted that there are fewer attacks against YU these days. I think that might have to do with the new charedi whipping boy YCT. But President Joel ended this part of our conversation by reiterating that he really believes Eilu v&#8217;Eilu applies here. He would love for recruitment to go to more charedi high schools and they have started to do that a little bit. The big tent includes the right and the left.</p>
<p>Our last two topics were more specific. I asked President Joel about Orthopraxy and those leaving Chasidic Judaism. First Orthopraxy. President Joel was very familiar with the phenomenon but began by saying that Orthopraxy is better than nothing. Mitoch shelo lishma, bah lishmah. He believes that the Education School is dealing with this on a broad scale. Passionless Judaism is a huge challenge. But he felt that there is plenty of passion at YU. President Joel led the first night of slichos with 1000 people in attendance. When he began with Ashrei Yoshvei Veisecha, the roar of the people joining him in prayer was very inspiring. There is a richness of passion at YU and he believes that this is helpful in avoiding Orthopraxy. But in the end, Judaism is more about deed than creed and the primary concern is with mitzvah not emunah. Certainly Judaism cannot be transmitted without spirituality and God, it must be linked with the Divine to thrive, but our focus is on action, not belief. But there is very little that is specifically targeting Orthopraxy and Atheism at YU and President Joel said the point was well taken and perhaps should be addressed more directly.</p>
<p>Finally we got to the ex-Chasids. I told him about my friends in real life and online that left chasidic Judaism. For a lot them, the Chasidic world was a very fragile bubble and once that bubble burst, the only place to go was out. Out meant, out of orthodox Judaism entirely. Personally, I think that many ex-Chasids would be very happy and very successful modern Orthodox Jews. But there is no track from Chasidic insularity to YU. I asked if YU could somehow market itself as an attractive alternative to insular life in the Chasidic world and perhaps provide a soft landing for ex-Chasids. He agreed that this was a great idea, but said that there is nothing like that happening right now. He did say that when Dr. Pelcovitz speaks to charedim and chasidic Jews he always says that he is a professor at YU. The idea is to present YU to them in a way that they may acknowledge its existence positively. This is a tiny step, but an important one. Professor Joel invited me to email him about this idea and discuss it further. I look forward to that opportunity and hope to make good on my suggestion in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>.</p>
<p>I had a wonderful time talking with President Joel and I hope to continue our conversation in the future. Thank you President Joel for your time and the opportunity to get to know YU on a personal level.</p>

Reflecting on my time as a blogger, I can see how my voice has changed, adjusted, and adapted to meet varying needs and wants as well as my (somewhat fluid) views on Torah and orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>If you look back at the articles from 2008 and 2009 you&#8217;ll see that they are a bit different than the articles I write these days. Not significantly different, just different enough to notice. But as I grew in my rabbinic position at Pacific Jewish Center, and journeyed through law school, and learned more Torah, and accumulated more experiences I found a voice. But this voice was not just my own voice. It was the voice of many Jews from every single kind of background that I have come in contact with through the last few years. (Similarly, many people are comfortable in my shul, while they are not comfortable in other orthodox shuls.) I am not saying I speak for everyone or even most people. Rather, there are enough people who find their own voice coming through the words when they read this blog.</p>
<p>It was never my intention to create controversy. It was never my intention to bash or insult large swaths of people. That may happen from time to time but that&#8217;s not the goal. In fact, I would rather do without it.</p>
<p><span id="more-5772"></span></p>
<p>Yet, I do find myself the target of criticism, usually from the charedi side of things, but often enough from the more liberal communities of orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. As a committed orthodox Jew, I recognize that I am easy pickings for more liberal Jews. But the criticism from the charedi side is more significant and has a greater impact on my reputation and career. I would therefore like to clarify and explain a few things to set the record straight.</p>
<p>My goal with this blog is to increase <em>kavod shamayim</em><em> </em>and <em>kiddush Hashem</em>. My goal is to nudge orthodox Judaism just enough to be more inclusive, more welcoming, and more attractive, to non-orthodox <em>and</em> to orthodox Jews. My goal is to inspire positive change that is permissible within the context of halacha. My goal is to facilitate conversations about the issues that are important to orthodox Jews and to everyone else. My goal is to increase communication between all people. My goal is to inspire people to find their voice within orthodox Judaism. My goal is to provide<strong> positive Jewish experiences</strong> to as many people as I possibly can.</p>
<p>Sometimes this means talking frankly and candidly about flaws in our communities. Sometimes that means challenging our leadership. Sometimes that means asking questions that deserve good answers. Sometimes that means finding ourselves in strange alliances with people who seem so far from our beliefs. Sometimes it means disagreeing with people far greater than me in Torah and with much more life experience than me. Sometimes it means making mistakes.</p>
<p>Am I a troublemaker? Should I be banned or excommunicated?</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The style of orthodox Judaism that I try to endorse and promote is a similar style to that of my rebbeim, my grandfathers and my father. My rebbeim never told me not to ask question and challenge. I was taught to respect the words of great rabbis and I do. But respect does not mean blind adherence. Sometimes it means challenging. After all, if their words are to be revered and respected, their words should be scrutinized as well. And if the forum was a newspaper or magazine 50 years ago, the forum today is the Internet. I apologize if people think the Internet is a <em>moshav leitzim</em> and a place where it is impossible to have a serious conversation. I think that has been disproved a million times over.</p>
<p>My family tradition has always been to be activists and involved in community growth. My grandfathers were engaged in the secular world, formally educated, and also great Torah scholars and influencers in the broad orthodox Jewish community. The Internet is a natural place for this kind of work to take place in 2012. I get emails, messages, calls, texts, comments, and snail mail, acknowledging and thanking me for this blog. The correspondence comes from every type of Jew and from all over the world. The Internet makes this possible. This blog is a community and it is new kind of community that didn&#8217;t exist 15 years ago. That doesn&#8217;t make it wrong.</p>
<p>My hope is that by creating this space for important conversations we can all make our claim in the future of orthodox Judaism. We all have a stake in it. We all can have our voice in it.</p>
<p>There is a method to the madness. I try my best to invite good discussion whether it is on the blog comments, on Facebook (there&#8217;s almost always an equal, if not better, comment thread over there), the coffee rooms, or at your Shabbos table. I try very hard not to cross the line of impropriety. Reasonable people may disagree over where that line is. But I do have a line and I do try to stay on one side of that line. (The safe side.) I welcome criticism and suggestions. Those of you who have reached out to me know that I respond to your positive emails and your negative emails.</p>
<p>I think orthodox Judaism is great. We have stories of unbelievable heroism and leadership in our communities. Many people are living beautiful orthodox Jewish lives. There are books that have been written about these people and their stories. I don&#8217;t think I need to reiterate how much goodness exists in our communities but I will do it anyway. Go to any orthodox Jewish community. You will find open homes, open hearts, and disproportionate virtue and charity. We are getting some things right and when we are doing well it means we are doing incredibly well. We can sit back and enjoy how awesome we are or we can try and tweak the things that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>My point is that I am not trying to destroy anything. The things that it may seem like I am trying to destroy are really just what I believe to be cancers that are destroying us a people. Sometimes chemo is the only solution. Whatever is being attacked, is being attacked with the ultimate goal that the body come out stronger and healthier than it was before the problems were attacked. Sometimes the conversations get a bit heated. Passion should not be confused with disrespect. Passion means that the writer cares. Sometimes I write objectively but other times I write persuasively and it is those times that passion can be misunderstood.</p>
<p>I remain committed to the ideals of passionate orthodox Judaism. I want Judaism to thrive. I want it to grow. I want more people to find joy and satisfaction in orthodox Judaism. These are my goals as a person and a rabbi. These are the same goals that I have for this blog.</p>
<p>Thank you all for making this blog a fun and education place to gather together on the Internet. I hope this post explains at least a little bit about what I trying to do over here. It may seem like it has no rhyme or reason or that I am just trying to push buttons. In fact, there is a rhyme and reason and while I trying to push buttons, the buttons are the ones that I hope will bring improvement and increased vitality to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I hope that if you are a reader of this blog and encounter people who criticize me or the things that are discussed here, this post will be able to quell their fears and reassure them that we are all on the same team. I truly believe in a future where we can all get along and everyone can find their place in orthodox Judaism. I am just trying my best to leave a little space for the out-of-the-box thinkers and non-conformists. We need all types in <em>Klal Yisrael</em>. Let&#8217;s just make sure there is a place for everyone.</p>
<p>Classically, Judaism believes that there is good and evil potential in everyone and everything. Nothing is intrinsically good or evil. The Internet presents us with incredible opportunities and tremendous power. If we are to ignore it and pretend it does not exists we may be wasting a great Heavenly gift. A place on the Internet full of fruitful and thoughtful discussion is a kiddush Hashem. I endeavor to make this blog just such a place. It may not make everyone happy all the time, but I am hopeful that we can agree on mutual goals and ideals and our meeting of the minds in those places allows for the kind of productive discussion on this blog and on many others.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to be the problem. We just want to be part of the solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/3454935091_Explaination_xlarge.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5750" title="3454935091_Explaination_xlarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/3454935091_Explaination_xlarge-300x236.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a>Children are fascinating creatures. All adults started out as children, yet we seem to have no real recollection of what it was like to be a child. Can we really recall what it was like to try things for the first time? Do we remember what it was like to dream of being old enough to make our own decisions? Or to be excluded from conversations because we were not old enough?</p>
<p>I think that intellectually we have those memories in our collective psyche but we can&#8217;t really relate to children.</p>
<p>One of the more difficult roles that adults need to play in the lives of children is &#8220;Answerer of Questions&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are many types of questions and many approaches to answering their questions. Some questions relate to religion, others to society, others are just questions that we cannot answer because we simply don&#8217;t know the answer.</p>
<p>An article in this week&#8217;s NY Times Magazine addresses the concerns of one father as he and his son encounter stereotypes in books and movies. In just 60 years, we as a society have severely adjusted what we consider proper and appropriate depictions of minorities. Yet, some stereotypes persist and are still debated in 2012.<span id="more-5749"></span></p>
<p>The article begins with the child asking why some pirates have a gorilla. The &#8220;gorilla&#8221; is not a gorilla. It is just a very ugly stereotype of an African male.</p>
<p>What do you answer your children when they ask about these ugly stereotypes? Read the article to see what that guy does.</p>
<p>But the article got me thinking about a few things as they relate to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>For starters, I think it is good for us to know that all kids have questions and many parents are placed in the uncomfortable position of answering them. It&#8217;s not just us.</p>
<p>Next, the obvious correlation to orthodox Judaism. In general, we teach our children a very midrashic form of Judaism. We also neglect to mention that there are other interpretations that are valid even within orthodox Judaism. So when our children ask questions and they challenge the wisdom they are being taught, we have ourselves a similar quandary. There are several options. We can defer until they get older. We can change the subject. We can answer the way we would answer an adult. We can reinforce the more fundamentalist view. We have to make the best choice for ourselves and our family.</p>
<p>But the most difficult issues arise when modern sensibilities feel betrayed by commandments in the Torah. I don&#8217;t need to be specific. But there are many instances where a child&#8217;s innocence can cause them to question the Divine Wisdom of God. What are we to say then? How do we explain to our children that God&#8217;s Book has different ideas about what is fair and just than we do?</p>
<p>There are really only three options. 1) We are wrong. God is right. Our minds are perverted by society and when our mind conflicts with God&#8217;s word, we must be wrong. Adjust your thinking accordingly. 2)We are right. God is wrong. Our society is smarter than the Author of this book that claims to be Divine. Toss the Book. 3) The word of God was just at one time. Society has changed and God&#8217;s will can change based on society&#8217;s adjustments.</p>
<p>Option 1 is easy. Fundamentalist Jews use this all the time and with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Option 2 is also easy. It not an acceptable approach in orthodox Judaism. Not one tiny bit.</p>
<p>Option 3 is complicated. Certainly, this is one part of the overall approach of the Reform and Conservative movements. This is not a sufficient reason for it to be wrong in the eyes of orthodox Jews, but it is a warning sign to many. The real question is not who subscribes to this belief, rather, is this belief an acceptable belief in certain circumstances?</p>
<p>Now I am not enough of an expert, by any means, to completely answer this question. However, I do have some preliminary thoughts. First of all, isn&#8217;t this the message of Avraham&#8217;s prayer for the Sedomites? I think it may be.</p>
<p>Further, some parts of Biblical Judaism have already been abrogated, either by the fact that we don&#8217;t have a Temple, or a Sanhedrin, or a Biblical Court. Other parts have been abrogated by the fact that we are not in a position to carry out the word of God. So what do we make of these? Are we to say that God&#8217;s will is that we should really be following these laws but we are <em>anusim</em> in these matters? Or do we say that this is fate? God&#8217;s will is that we should adapt over time and these laws should not be followed in 2012.</p>
<p>There are also cultural and social aspects of contemporary orthodox Judaism that may seem to be part of Judaism but are really just non-essential parts of our lives. Certainly, there are some things that fall into this category that may even be a mitzvah to reject. I will leave this category as a very general comment.</p>
<p>And then there are areas of Jewish law and thought that have not been touched or adjusted at all over time. Or have only been marginally adjusted. Admittedly, I don&#8217;t think any of those are explicitly found in the written Torah. But the Oral Law has generally been treated with the same reverence and reluctance for change. So returning to the original question, is Option 3 acceptable for orthodox Jews?</p>
<p>In some ways yes in other ways no. Is there a pattern or any rhyme or reason to when the answer is yes and when the answer is no? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Most importantly, these questions are not just questions that our children ask, they are questions that we as adults ask. We can&#8217;t be afraid of the questions. We need to be confident in our answers or in our lack of answers. But either way, taking Option 1 or Option 2 ends the conversation. We don&#8217;t want to end the conversation. We want to continue the conversation that&#8217;s been taking place for 3000 years and will take place until the end of days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5735" title="1828636222-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1-300x173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="173" /></a>One blogger at the New York Celebrate Israel Parade was so overwhelmed by the orthodox community&#8217;s involvement at the parade that she declared the future of Judaism in America to be orthodoxy. To be clear, the writer is not orthodox, but the lack of apparent vibrancy from the non-orthodox seemed to swing her vote for orthodoxy as the future of Judaism in America.</p>
<p>I happen to agree. It is extremely difficult to maintain cultural and social Judaism absent ritual and observance of Jewish law. It can be done, but it is becoming more difficult with each passing generation. The proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>The brand of orthodoxy that will prevail in America is still up for discussion. The writer of that blog post was referring to modern orthodox Judaism seeing as they are the ones she saw at the parade.</p>
<p>Another person at the parade was overwhelmed to a certain degree by the participation of the non-orthodox. This person felt that orthodoxy was not as well represented as they could and should have been. In this person&#8217;s opinion, the parade showcased non-orthodox Jews showing their passion for Israel. The orthodox Jews were like an afterthought. This person is an orthodox Jew.<span id="more-5734"></span></p>
<p>How interesting is it that two different perspectives can yield such different observations?</p>
<p>I believe that we need a combination of the two to maximize the chances of success for American Judaism. And the perfect opportunity to implement this vision is at the parade. Israel is something we all (with the exception of some fringe anti-Israel groups) can agree upon. Israel activism and AIPAC are full of orthodox Jews. Not just modern orthodox Jews. More right wing Jews strongly identify with Israel as well. The JewsNews sites report heavily on Israeli society, politics, and events. Those are sites that are read and written by right leaning (not in the political sense) orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a parade for Israel is the perfect time to march together in support of a cause and in solidarity with each other. The modern orthodox community has embraced this opportunity and marches in the parade every year. But aside from a few sporadic people from the more yeshivish side of the spectrum, the Agudah / chasidic / Lakewood communities are noticeably absent from the parade.</p>
<p>I understand that there are political concerns. I understand there may be halachic concerns as well. But I just wish we could see past those, if only for one day to stand together and do something as a united Jewish people. I just wish that for once, we could all join in unison and make a clear statement on behalf of something we all agree upon.</p>
<p>In the future of American Judaism, all Jews are able to work together on the things upon which we agree, and there are many such things. The places where we disagree will still be contested. But it will be more like two opinions from the same team as opposed to two opinions from opposing teams.</p>
<p>If we are to get there, I think the New York Celebrate Israel Parade <strong>2013</strong> is a great place to start.</p>

It was originally posted on Reddit where it has generated a decent conversation and a respectable 86 comments at this moment.</p>
<p>All the necessary information is in there. The question is not about her parents and their philosophy, it is about the young woman and what she should do. My opinion follows the question.</p>
<p>Without further ado, have at it.</p>
<p><strong>How do I tell my mother that being asked to marry another Jewish person as an atheist is against what I believe?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I grew up centerist Orthodox. I&#8217;m an atheist who is culturally Jewish in that I read the Forward, some orthodox blogs, and that is it. I don&#8217;t care if my (nonexistant) kids know that about me, and I don&#8217;t care if in my (nonexistant) marriage that we celebrate Hannukah or passover or christmas. My brother is dating a non-Jewish girl, and my parents are threatening that if he marries her, they will take out a restraining order if he tries to talk them after the marriage. Meanwhile, I&#8217;m sitting here realizing that it might be a bad idea to marry another affiliated with a synagogue type Jewish person, because I don&#8217;t want that for my kids. It is more important to me that they be free thinking, particularly about moral issues, than have a rabbi/school system tell them what to believe. I&#8217;m currently single, I&#8217;d like to meet another atheist, preferably one who is driven by moral questions (since I am). How do I tell my parents, particularly my mother, that asking me to marry an affiliated Jewish person is probably a bad idea.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Technically speaking, despite growing up orthodox, it would be an intermarriage, and likely to fail because I wouldn&#8217;t share values.</em></p>
<p>Since I too am a reader of this blog I am have taken the liberty of offering my opinion:<span id="more-5656"></span></p>
<p>Although we oftentimes resent it, other people&#8217;s feelings about us should play a role in our decisions. I know that sounds very old fashioned and repressive, but I think it is truer than progressives like to think.</p>
<p>Parents are not just biological sperm and egg donors. They are not just responsible for raising us and nurturing us through the trials of childhood and our teenage years. Parents and children are connected in a deeper way in that they have had the most influence over our lives and their presence or absence can have a far ranging impact on our adult years as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think step one is to determine if you can be happy and at the same time satisfy their needs. I don&#8217;t mean that one should <em>sacrifice </em>one&#8217;s happiness for the sake of a parent&#8217;s specific request. But if one knows what their parents want and it can conform with one&#8217;s own needs, I think that should be the preferable choice.</p>
<p>Allowing the feelings of a third party influence our decision making is not be default allowing them to control us. It can be very empowering to accommodate the feelings of others. Especially when the stakes are so high. We are talking about parents here. Not Hebrew School teachers.</p>
<p>I know that it may feel &#8220;fake&#8221; or that it would seem wrong for a young adult to narrow one&#8217;s marriage prospects to a smaller pool because of one&#8217;s parents&#8217; request. But I think that making the conscious choice not to burn that bridge and at the same time not settle in one&#8217;s search for a marriage partner is the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>That being said, if one would feel that their parents ruined their marriage prospects and bear resentment towards them for forcing them to marry against their own wishes, I don&#8217;t think it is worth considering the wishes of the parents. Only if one can be happy with the choice is it a fair choice.</p>
<p>Further, there are a lot of Jewish atheists. Many of them are culturally Jewish or they simply identify with some Jewish ideals and causes despite not being religious or believers in God. Jewish and religious are not necessarily corollaries. I think a Jewish atheist can marry another Jewish atheist and it would not feel like an intermarriage, it would feel very comfortable. In fact, marrying a non-Jewish atheist will probably strain the marriage more than marrying a Jewish non-atheist would. This is simply because of the cultural osmosis that all people who were brought up Jewish experience.</p>
<p>Finally, you ask <em>How do I tell my mother that being asked to marry another Jewish person as an atheist is against what I believe?</em></p>
<p>The answer to that is that although it may be against your &#8220;beliefs&#8221;, it may not go against your &#8220;interests&#8221; and those are equally if not more important than living by one&#8217;s convictions. It&#8217;s not faking to make a concession on beliefs for the same of interests. It&#8217;s prudent.</p>
<p>In the end, I think there are enough options to keep your parents and you happy and I would recommend exhausting those options first so long as you are able to conquer any  of your own natural resentment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ying_yangredblue.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5630" title="ying_yangredblue" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ying_yangredblue.png" alt="" width="210" height="210" /></a>Despite the dearth of legitimate political debate on the airwaves, excellent political discourse can be found at dinner tables, bars, and Facebook walls. I don&#8217;t mean just conservatives and liberals debating traditional marriage vs. civil rights for gay people, or socialism vs. capitalism, or the merits of the death penalty. I am also talking about religious discourse. Arguments about the validity of religion, arguments over the rationality of atheism, debate within religions on the proper way to practice religion, debate within atheism as to what is the best way to be an atheist, take place on a regular basis with vigor and sometimes with surprising candor and logic.</p>
<p>Does anyone change their mind during these debates? Not really.</p>
<p>As an aside, I don&#8217;t think that means they are useless or a waste of time and energy. I think the goal of a conversation or debate is to discover the precise point of disagreement. This is useful because it helps the various sides understand exactly where the source of the argument lies. This can serve a very important role as it deflects the argument from becoming personal and it makes the argument less broad, creating  more space for agreement.</p>
<p>But the question that we have to answer is if no one changes their mind after a debate how do we develop our leanings? In other words, clearly it cannot be based on logic as the points are subjective and well argued points have little sway on the other side of the debate, so if arguments don&#8217;t impact our political leanings, how did our opinions form in the first place?<span id="more-5629"></span></p>
<p>According to an article in the Guardian these leanings are deeply rooted in our psyches and are more nature than nurture, although nurture can effect nature. In other words, if you want to change your political beliefs, the only thing that you do is change your environment and who you associate with. If you want to change another person&#8217;s political beliefs, well, good luck. Our brains can even be wired for liberalism in some things and conservatism in other things. (That explains Jewish left wing modern orthodox republicans.)</p>
<p>All of this comes to a head when viewed through the prism of orthodox Judaism. There are liberal views and there are conservative views. Some people lean to the conservative views. Those are certainly the more popular views in orthodox Judaism over the last few decades. But what about the people who just don&#8217;t relate? The ones who find themselves gravitating towards liberal views within orthodox Judaism are often perceived as slackers, or looking for leniencies because they find the more conservative views too difficult or demanding. That may be true sometimes. I don&#8217;t think that is necessarily a bad thing or a criticism per se.</p>
<p>But I think that we can add this to the mix. Sometimes people are drawn to ideologies, even within their religion because of the way their brain is wired. Luckily, orthodox Judaism has legitimate conservative and liberal varieties of the religion. There is a place for everyone. We can&#8217;t squeeze out the people who are more comfortable with the less conservative views simply because the trend is to go in that direction. There needs too be room for all orthodox Jews in the spectrum to find meaning and satisfaction in orthodox Judaism and not feel marginalized by the dominant fundamentalists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/laura-talmudStretch.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5618" title="laura-talmudStretch" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/laura-talmudStretch-253x300.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="300" /></a>I received a press release for the New English Talmud from Koren a few days ago. With all the excitement over the Asifa and the unexpected brouhaha over the role of women in chasidic Judaism, I neglected to post my initial thoughts on this edition of the Talmud.</p>
<p>First of all, I am a huge fan of the Talmud. I think studying Talmud is amazing. The experience of Talmud study, when done right, can be at least as inspirational and spiritually satisfying as anything else in the world. The problem is that it can be a locked book. An English translation is nice, but so much of the Talmud requires background information and illustration that the simple rendering of the words into English is not sufficient to unlock the Talmud.</p>
<p>Artscroll has magnificently risen to the occasion with their English Talmud. Their contribution marked a key turning point for mainstreaming Talmud study. Their translation and interpretations follow Yeshiva style conventions. The Artscroll Talmud may be the greatest contribution to Torah study since the first printing of the Tamud in the 16th century. Its commentary digest is extremely well researched and presented and the sheer magnitude of the project is awe-inspiring.<span id="more-5617"></span></p>
<p>It is hard to believe, but 30 years prior to the Artscroll Talmud was conceived, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz began a similar project translating the Talmud into modern Hebrew and penning a fresh Hebrew commentary digest. His work would have been more widely used if he had maintained the canonized page format of all the previous printings of the Talmud. But he did not and his version was placed under Rabbinic ban.</p>
<p>The New English Talmud will provide another option for English speaking sudents of the Talmud. The translation is adapted from Rabbi Steinsaltz&#8217;s translation into modern Hebrew and the commentary is his. But in keeping with tradition, the New English Talmud stays true to the canonized pagination of the Talmud thus rectifying an unfortunate error in the previous versions.</p>
<p>More options is a good thing. In particular, this version has an emphasis on the aesthetic, taking layout seriously and using color illustrations. It truly looks to be a remarkable and fresh way to study the Talmud. Plus, having two big names in the English Talmud game will force both to step up their games and bring even more innovative, high quality products to the market.</p>
<p>Artscroll announced their iPad app a few months ago. Koren is also supplying an app. Only a few details are available at this point but I look forward to using both of them.</p>
<p>My shul has a set of Artscroll and I have been gifted (by a loving family member) a significant selection of the New English Talmud so I will be able to do a more complete comparison after I receive my copy. In the meantime, if you are considering an English Talmud purchase, I strongly urge you to consider the Koren version. It looks to be amazing.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, the YouTube video promo for the New English Talmud is a tad on the ridiculous side. I&#8217;m not sure what they were thinking.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/xojane_logo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5611" title="xojane_logo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/xojane_logo-300x102.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="102" /></a>(If you haven&#8217;t read Chaya&#8217;s article, you&#8217;ll need to read that first. Click: <a href="http://www.xojane.com/relationships/hasidic-women-sex" target="_blank">XOJane</a>)</em></p>
<p>I am very happy that you have found personal satisfaction in your religious life. I am also happy you took to the Internet to profess your love for your personal relationship with God (and apparently your husband). I honestly wish every orthodox Jewish woman was as religiously fulfilled as you are. However, sadly this is not the case.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real issues I take with your effusive article.</p>
<p>You represented your subjective experience as the objective experience of chasidic women. Making things worse, you failed to disclose in the article many important factors that contributed to your personal experience. Indeed, you made them clear in the comments, but it was too little, too late.</p>
<p><span id="more-5610"></span></p>
<p>You were not born into orthodox Judaism. That means that you actually chose the life you live. That&#8217;s amazing and I am so happy for you that you arrived at what I believe to be the truth on your own. But the simple fact is that people who are born into orthodox Judaism don&#8217;t choose it. This means that they are stuck. For better or for worse. Some people are thrilled to be stuck. Others, not so much. But this means that while you feel like you are free to as you please. I am sure you realize that if an orthodox woman would put on &#8220;pants and go snort coke&#8221; she would probably be asked to leave the community and be handed a quick divorce and lose custody of her children. So it is not as free as you intimate. It might feel free to you because you chose it. But it is not free.</p>
<p>The second thing that you did not disclose, and this is a far more egregious error, is that you are a member of the Chabad sect of chasidus. The reason this is so crucial is because Chabad is different than every single other chasidic sect. There are absolutely no social correlations between Chabad and the other sects of chasidus. None.</p>
<p>In the words of Hella Winston (quoted from <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/29/book-review-unchosen/" target="_blank">Unchosen</a>):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With its “mitzvah tanks”, campus Chabad houses, celebrity stuffed fundraising telethons, and outposts across the globe, Lubavitch has become almost synonymous with Hasidism. This despite the fact that in the United State it numbers less than half the size of Satmar and is hardly representative of the Hasidic community as a whole. With their mission – unique in the Hasidic world – to attract unaffiliated Jews, Lubavitchers are raised to engage (Jewish) outsiders, doing missionary work wherever Jews are found around the world. [...]</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This emphasis on proselytizing has meant that a significant percentage of Lubavitchers were not born in the community but joined by choice. Often those who join [...] have led formerly secular lives, which likely included a college education or beyond. [...] Additionally, Lubavitch raises a substantial amount of money from non-Hasidic Jews [...]. All of this is strong contrast to the other Hasidic sects, which include Satmar, Ger, Viznitz, Belz, Bobov, Skver, Sponka, Pupa and Breslow, to name only a few. In these sects, almost all members are born into the community, and none engages in formal outreach, making them comparatively more insulated from , and less aware of, the ways of the outside society than their counterparts in Lubavitch.</em></p>
<p>You see, the insular chasidic sects bear no resemblance to this world you love. Their world is even more closed and more insular. So your personal experience, while wonderful, has no relevance to the world of chasidic women in the insular sects of Satmar, Ger, Vizhnitz, Square, etc. More importantly, their world is a world where women are more oppressed than in the rest of orthodox Judaism. There are rules against driving, getting an education, men and women walk on separate sides of the street in some communities, there are very strict rules about sex, many women shave their heads, girls are wed after extremely short meetings to young men they barely know, they must wear synthetic (bad looking) wigs, can&#8217;t wear latest fashions (even the modest ones), I could go on and on. The point is that in these communities, women don&#8217;t feel the great freedom and empowerment that you feel.</p>
<p>Ironically, by ignoring all this omitted information, you are causing a disservice to chasidic women everywhere. You make it sound like things are all honky-dory. But they are not. I am sure many chasidic women love their lot in life. But your experience has no bearing on theirs. In fact, I would bet you wouldn&#8217;t last a week in Kiryas Joel or New Square! The things you love about your Judaism are simply not present in those uber-insular communities.</p>
<p>But the most difficult thing about your article is that it completely ignores that plain fact that in halacha, women can easily be perceived as second class citizens. This is an incontrovertible fact. Women cannot be rabbis, cantors, judges, witnesses in Beis Din, and they aren&#8217;t counted as part of a minyan. Women&#8217;s dress codes are medieval, their stained underwear is checked by rabbis, they are discouraged from using contraception, they don&#8217;t study the most important text of orthodox Judaism &#8211; the Talmud (because they are assumed to have weaker minds), and they don&#8217;t take positions of authority. Heck the women in Crown Heights are not even allowed to vote on communal issues! I am well aware of the various apologetics and interpretations of these rules. It could be argued that women have an elevated role and do not require the encumbrances of mitzvah observance. I have used them and taught them myself. Some people buy those explanations, but many others do not. It&#8217;s great that so many orthodox Jewish women are happy with their place in orthodox Judaism, but it is completely reasonable for women inside the system and outside the system to perceive orthodox Judaism as oppressive to women.</p>
<p>In sum, I respect your healthy exuberance for your Chabad lifestyle. I think it&#8217;s great. Share the love. By all means. But please do not generalize and use terms like &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; to describe your personal experience. Not only is it disingenuous, it actually harms the cause of those who are trying to advocate for women&#8217;s rights and opportunities in the chasidic and otherwise orthodox Jewish women. The future of orthodox Judaism will need to make adjustments to the way we deal with women issues (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/13/the-future-of-women-in-orthodox-judaism/">The Future of Women in Orthodox Judaism</a>). Pretending it is perfect as it is, sets us backwards several decades.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/future.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5547" title="future" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/future-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>A few weeks ago, the Spring issue of the Klal Perspectives Journal was released. I noted the excellent article written by Moishe Bane and recommended that everyone read it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/24/klal-perspectives-spring-2012-one-excellent-article-stands-out-from-the-rest/" target="_blank">Klal Perspectives Spring 2012: One Excellent Article Stands Out From the Rest</a>)</p>
<p>I mentioned in passing that I had my own response to some of the issues that were discussed in the journal.</p>
<p><a href="http://klalperspectives.org/spring-2012/spring-12-questions/" target="_blank">Writers were asked to address three questions</a>. They are more fully developed on the Klal Perspectives site. These are the questions in general terms:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>How accurate is the perception that there is a crisis in the degree of religious fulfillment experienced by observant Jews?</em></li>
<li><em>What is the source of this alienation and what can be done to cure it?</em></li>
<li><em> Are there proven methods to inspire observant Jews experiencing a gap in religious enthusiasm?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-5544"></span></p>
<p>I begin with three short answers. 1. Fairly accurate. 2. Modernity and a fresh approach. 3. No.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Judaism of the Future</h2>
<div>
<p>In my personal experience, I have come across a lot of people that would somewhat fit into this broad category. All of them know others in the same situation as well. So I would say the numbers are higher than just the number of people I know of personally. Of those people, there is a general feeling of malaise about religion. Some are apathetic to their plight and others are anguished by it. The apathetic ones are resigned to a marginalized relationship with God and their religion. The ones in anguish wish they could turn back the clock to their yeshiva days when they felt something special or they dream of living up to the lofty goals of <em>dveykus</em> and spiritual nirvana.</p>
<p>I think there is a need to discuss this issue. It is a legitimate problem and is definitely causing discomfort among many orthodox Jews. Would I call it a crisis? I don&#8217;t know. What is of greater concern is that the issue is framed as an issue of <em>perception</em>. The question implies that happy, fulfilled orthodox Jews are looking at others and are concerned that others are not feeling fulfilled. That is what perception means. I would prefer if the question focused on the actual people who are feeling burnt out of religion and not the assumptions or judgments of others. So I would rather adjust the question to: Is there a significant group of orthodox Jews who feel under-fulfilled by their Judaism?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is undoubtedly, yes.</p>
<p>The more interesting question is the second question. Where does this spiritual melancholy come from?</p>
<p>It was hard to pinpoint a consensus among the journal writers on this point. Most of the writers attributed the problem to a flaw or misstep in <em>Avodas Hashem </em>(religious observance). As I remarked in a previous post, Moishe Bane pointed more toward phenomena outside Mitzvah observance that affect one&#8217;s spiritual psyche. While I agree in form, I have a different twist on the substance. I think there is something that is being overlooked in these discussions and that is the historical context of orthodox Judaism&#8217;s rise and its place in the modern world.</p>
<p>Taking a big step back and looking at orthodox Judaism from a bird&#8217;s eye view gives one an interesting perspective of theology in orthodox Judaism. We have the canonized books of Tanach. The stories in Tanach are replete with miracles, Divine communications with people, complex heroes and villains, struggles with idol worship, violence and war, and stories of high drama. The lens with which these stories are viewed in orthodox Judaism is through the lens of <em>Chazal</em> and then through the eyes of the <em>Rishonim</em> who elucidate the teachings of <em>Chazal</em>.</p>
<p>Then we have the <em>Mishnah</em>, <em>Talmud</em>, various <em>midrashic</em> sources, and their numerous commentaries. The world of <em>Chazal</em> was also a fantastic world that talks of miracles brought about through acts of the saintly <em>Tannaim</em> and <em>Amoraim</em>, an awareness of angels and demons, a hybrid of folk medicine, real medicine, and faith healing, and many other ideas and expressions that were appropriate for Ancient Greece and the medieval era.</p>
<p>More recently, we have the writings of the <em>Arizal</em> and his students. Somewhat related, we have the works of the <em>baalei</em> <em>mussar</em> and the <em>Chassidus</em> which paralleled it. These teachings focus on a transcendental version of Judaism. Their focus on perfection of character and mind, hearkens the typology of a superJew. The person who is complete control of his life, thoughts, and actions. All of it with cosmic proportions. One misstep and worlds are affected. The ultimate goal of these works is to elevate the Jew from man to [almost] angel. But the payoffs are lofty. <em>Ruach</em> <em>HaKodesh</em>, understanding dreams, granting blessings that come true, and practical mystic powers are part and parcel of this genre.</p>
<p>Throughout the last 2000 years, various codes of halacha have been codified as well. The primary sources used today are the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> and the <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Brurah</em> on <em>Orach</em> <em>Chaim</em>. The status of halacha has been cemented for several hundred years. To be lenient, based on a <em>rishon</em> or <em>gaon</em> not quoted in the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> is considered unacceptable. Removing statutes that were based on mistakes or assumptions that have been shown to be incorrect is not really permissible. Historical social norms that helped establish <em>halacha</em> are not considered when analyzing <em>halacha</em> today.</p>
<p>I believe this is a fair overview of the basic corpus of Torah that is studied today by orthodox Jews. I also believe that the descriptions of those general bases of knowledge are accurate and I do not mean them in a disrespectful or cynical way. At all.</p>
<p>But herein lies the problem, I think.</p>
<p>The kind of life a Jew expects his religion to provide for him is completely unrealistic in modern terms. We are not going to debate or discuss the veracity or meaning of the fantastic claims made in each of these genres of Torah study. But we are going to assume that this is the world the average orthodox Jew associates with his religion. Years of studying about open miracles, direct communication with God, demons, angels, mystical universes affected by man&#8217;s acts, practical kabbalistic feats, and the like, has an effect on the one doing the studying. Its effect is that the person associates the religion with these things.</p>
<p>We hear about stories of great Jewish leaders who made incredible things happen. Whether it is Choni HaMa&#8217;agel (drawing a circle and demanding rain &#8211; and it worked), Reb Yochanan (turning people into bags of bones with his eyes), Rashi (born after his father tossed a diamond to the sea), Reb Yehuda HaChassid (the wall that moved to save his life), the Baal Shem Tov (flying around Europe), The Arizal (locating ancient graves by &#8220;sense&#8221;), my great-great-grandfather Reb Elya Lopian (meeting Eliyahu HaNavi), or the Chazon Ish (knowing how to do brain surgery) all these stories reinforce the idea that Jews can do supernatural things if we could just get to that level.</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews are generally smart, well educated (at least in comparison with the majority of the rest of the world), come from good, balanced homes, and are generally part of the middle to upper class of society. In my experience, most people who believe the type of legends, stories, and anecdotes that are taught in yeshivos are less advanced in every other way.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain. In ancient times <em>everybody</em> believed the kinds of things that are described in the Talmud. In medieval times <em>everyone </em>believed in the kinds of things the <em>rishonim</em> speak of. In early modern times <em>almost everybody</em> believed in the same kinds of things we find in <em>mussar</em> <em>seforim</em> and <em>chassidus</em>. The folk cures and superstitions that have crept into <em>halacha</em> were <em>common for the people of their time</em>. Today, the only people who still believe such things are looked at as backward or relics of the past.</p>
<p>I am not using this analysis to judge whether these things are true or whether they are essential to our religion. I am only making the following point: Many of the very basic assumptions of orthodox Jews were prevalent in the rest of the world, each in their time, but they have been discarded by smart, successful, happy people in the non-orthodox Jewish world. They <em>used to believe </em>in similar ideas and stories, but they <em>no longer</em> believe in them.</p>
<p>In other words, it used to be <em>normal</em> to believe in these fantastic abilities and tales. <em>Everyone did it.</em> This was their way of  life. It could be explained by pointing to all the unanswered questions that are prevalent in their understanding of the universe. They had no better explanation for various phenomena. Rather they had to believe in the supernatural on a regular basis. God was responsible for everything because they had no other explanation. But now, it is only religious fanatics, naive people, those who live in undeveloped countries and other indigenous groups that still have maintain these kinds of fundamentalist beliefs because for the most part, they are either wrong or unnecessary.</p>
<p>At this point, the orthodox Jew, is confronted with two basic options. Either the beliefs of orthodox Judaism that go against modern sensibilities are true and the beliefs that everyone who was not an orthodox Jew, which were nearly identical in substance and identical in form, were not true in the first place, so it is still reasonable to believe and this is an example of the people of the world &#8220;not getting it&#8221;. <em>Or</em>, orthodox Jews and everyone else believed in the same kinds of things a long time ago, the fact that society as a whole has moved on is indicative that the beliefs are flawed and perhaps many of them are untrue.</p>
<p>Again, I am only pointing to the options, and not to the validity of either position. I am merely stating what I believe are the reasonable options available to a modern Jew when considering traditional orthodox Jewish beliefs in our modern times.</p>
<p>To me, this is the underlying, unexpressed issue that lies beneath the surface and causes the most internal angst and frustration with regard to spiritual success. The goals are impossible to achieve. None of my friends from yeshiva have <em>ruach</em> <em>hakodesh</em>. None of my <em>rebbeim</em> from yeshiva perform miracles. The universe of our heroes simply does not exist anymore. None of us has experienced or witnessed the kinds of things that are such an integral part of our lore.</p>
<p>Yet, the majority of what we learn today was borne out of that universe. The kind of relationship <em>they </em>had with the Almighty is not able to be reproduced in a modern society. Whereas, every nook and cranny of life was a connection to something Greater, due to a lack of sophistication or flawed understanding of science or a general mood of superstition, the world in which they lived was a world where God was found in everything at all times. It was so easy. In those days, it was stupid to <em>not s</em>ee God in everything. But in our modern times, where we have answers to many questions, we have reasonable explanations for many things that were mysterious in the past, where we know that superstition is bunk, all that seems so distant, so impossible, and so different from our world.</p>
<p>This causes one of two things to happen. For some people, the ideals become too lofty. &#8220;Oy, I&#8217;ll never find the supernatural in my life.&#8221; If all your life you&#8217;ve been striving for something that simply does not happen anymore, the frustration is going to be overwhelming. The result is apathy toward religion.</p>
<p>But for others, the skeptics among us, it can cause people to throw out the baby with the bathwater. It all goes down the drain. &#8220;If Chazal were wrong about some things, maybe they were wrong about everything.&#8221; If our religion has similar characteristics to ancient pagan cults, to other religions, and to medieval folklore, which parts are &#8220;real&#8221;? These people will by and large either leave orthodoxy, become orthoprax, or live in the agony of what they believe to be two mutually exclusive truths.</p>
<p>If I were asked to point at what I believed to be causing spiritual malaise among Klal Yisrael, I would point to this. The idea that our religion has so many characteristics that are similar to clearly false beliefs and that the world of our religious heroes is a world that for the most part, no longer exists.</p>
<p>So what is the cure?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not simple nor is it something that I see happening anytime soon. But I think that R&#8217; Soleveitchik was on the right path in this regard. A new, modern understanding of Judaism and our culture needs to be cultivated. We cannot base our theology on ancient Greek methodologies, or Muslim and Christian approaches from the Middle Ages. If we are confident that we have the truth, and I believe we do, we must believe that it is can be reconciled with modernity with absolute fealty to the words of Chazal which are binding and the halacha that flows from those words. I am not advocating that we abandon halachic Judaism, <em>chas v&#8217;shalom</em>. I am advocating for a new approach to Torah that uses modern ideas <em>much in the same way Chazal used ideas from their time </em>and all the great Jewish thinkers over the last 2000 years up until recently.</p>
<p>It can start with our education system and approach to the non-orthodox and to the non-Jews in our world. We have transplanted a model from a time of blood libels, of pogroms, and of Jew hatred, that led to the Holocaust in Europe and are trying to implement it in a free, safe, and friendly United States of America. It&#8217;s just more of the same. We can&#8217;t expect those models to work anymore. It&#8217;s a brave new world. It&#8217;s a <em>different </em>world. And just as we can&#8217;t expect that style of <em>chinuch </em>(education) to work on these shores, we can&#8217;t expect that what inspired and fascinated a water carrier or a farmer in Europe circa 1730 would inspire and fascinate an accountant or an attorney today.</p>
<p>On an individual level, I strongly recommend that people trying to find their place in orthodox Judaism by finding the things that they like. Exploit them. Enjoy them. Focus on what makes you feel good religiously and what inspires you. All the while, maintaining strict adherence to <em>halacha</em> and conforming to the standards of one&#8217;s community. But don&#8217;t expect the kinds of returns that our great-great-grandparents had. It was a different world with different challenges. What you should expect is that you can have a <em>2012 type of relationship with God and Judaism.</em> Set that kind of realistic goal and a lot of disappointment and apathy can be avoided.</p>
<p>I really believe that this is not only possible, but necessary. I think we can do it and that we must do it. Each era of Judaism had its challenges and configured a form of orthodox, <em>halachic</em> Judaism to meet those challenges all while remaining strictly adherent to the <em>daled amos shel halacha</em>. We can do the same for the future of our Judaism. We can move past the model of early modern history based on the romanticization of European pre-war shtetl life and forge our own beautiful, successful, passionate orthodox Judaism of the future.</p>
<p>To answer the third question, this method is not proved to work. It is a suggestion that I am confident has some merit. I hope that we can make the adjustments that we need to ensure that our children and grandchildren feel a similar, yet different passion, as our parents and grandparents did before us. I think we can.</p>

The conversation was mostly about the Jewish court system that we have in place today. R&#8217; Schachter expressed deep reservations about the Beis Din system.</p>
<p>He exposed corruption and wrongdoing within the system. He didn&#8217;t pull punches and he spoke with the authority of a true Torah giant with a lifetime of personal experience. The article was a bit of a sensation. His opening salvo: &#8220;<em>The present system is terrible.&#8221;</em> From there, R&#8217; Schachter spoke from personal experience about the flaws, inadequacies, and corruption in the system.</p>
<p>Here a few choice quotes:<span id="more-5404"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Q:</strong> Are you saying there is a problem with the dayanim? </em><br />
<em><strong>A:</strong> Of course. Do you think that all of the dayanim are honest? Many are acting like toanim; many of the toanim are acting like criminals. They make up their minds in advance that their side has to win,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Q: </strong>Could there be a watchdog group, with rabbanim getting together to examine how the batei din are behaving? </em><br />
<em><strong>A:</strong> It’s a safek sakana [possible danger] for the watchdog group; they’re going to be killed.</em></p>
<p>Are all batei din corrupt? Probably not. So how are the good batei din supposed to separate their courts? How will people know which courts are honest? Is there a way to become more transparent?</p>
<p>I think this is the motivation behind a journal that found its way to my mailbox this week. The Journal of the Beth Din of America is a new publication that I believe was created to set itself apart from the the negative stereotypes illustrated by R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p>From the introduction to the first edition:</p>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Yet despite a well earned reputation for adjudicating cases fairly, efficiently and competently, the public lacks a full understanding and appreciation for much of the work of the Beth Din of America. This is because, like all batei din, the Beth Din is committed to confidentiality for the individuals, families and firms that utilize its services. Unlike secular court decisions which are published and accessible, beit din arbitration awards are provided only to parties and their legal counsel.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The publication of The Journal of the Beth Din of America is an attempt to change this situation, and educate the public about Jewish law as applied in a beit din, with particular attention to the outlook and practices of the Beth Din of America. The journal will primarily feature articles by dayanim of the Beth Din of America and other contributors. In each issue, we also hope to publish decisions actually rendered by the Beth Din of America (appropriately anonymized and approved for publication by the parties).</em></p>
<p>I think this is great. The journal features several types of articles. The articles are great for their content. Even if there was no side benefit other than to increase Torah study and wisdom, the journal is great. Most importantly, decisions of the Beth Din of America will be published after being anonymized. This will increase the Beth Din of America&#8217;s credibility as their decisions will be transparent and available for all to see. Further, it will either expose other Batei Din as closed walls with less accountability and hopefully it will incentivize them to clean up their acts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small step, but an important step in the right direction. Kudos to the Beth Din of America.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/western_religious_symbols.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5278" title="western_religious_symbols" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/western_religious_symbols.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="167" /></a>Remember Tapps? Tapps is the governing body of Texas parochial schools including Beren Academy. A few weeks ago they became a household name after they refused to adjust their tournament schedule out of deference to Beren&#8217;s observance of Shabbos. Everyone from CNN, the NY Times, ESPN, and others reported the story and eventually Tapps acquiesced. Beren played Friday afternoon and won. They moved on to the championship on Saturday night and lost in the final game.</p>
<p>At the time, some people accused Tapps of anti-Semitism. I didn&#8217;t feel like it was anti-Semitism as much as it was myopia and insensitivity to others. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/28/beren-academy-forfeits-tournament-game-because-of-shabbos-and-the-world-reacts/">Beren Academy Forfeits Tournament Game Because of Shabbos and the World Reacts</a>).</p>
<p>The NY Times decided to do a little digging and has made some interesting discoveries. While Tapps may not be anti-Semitic on its face, some new information forces us to reconsider.<span id="more-5277"></span></p>
<p>It seems that not only did Tapps make life difficult for a Jewish school, Beren, but they have made it impossible, if not extremely degrading, for Muslim schools to join Tapps. While their decisions with regard to the Jewish school were ambiguous, their actions toward the Muslim schools can only be described as bigoted.</p>
<p>One school was given the opportunity to be considered for acceptance in Tapps and was asked to fill out a questionnaire. No  non-Muslim schools were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The queries on the questionnaire were also quite offensive. Here are some of the nuggets discovered by NY Times:</p>
<p><em>Historically, there is nothing in the Koran that fully embraces Christianity or Judaism in the way a Christian and/or a Jew understands his religion. Why, then, are you interested in joining an association whose basic beliefs your religion condemns?”</em></p>
<p><em>It is our understanding that the Koran tells you not to mix with (and even eliminate) the infidels. Christians and Jews fall into that category. Why do you wish to join an organization whose membership is in disagreement with your religious beliefs?</em></p>
<p><em>How does your school address certain Christian concepts? (i.e. celebrating Christmas)</em></p>
<p><em>When was the Bible allegedly polluted? Does the Koran actually state that the Bible is polluted?</em></p>
<p><em>What is your attitude about the spread of Islam in America? What are the goals of your school in this regard?</em></p>
<p>The school answered the questionnaire and was still not accepted into Tapps.</p>
<p>Tapps also sent a survey to the other schools asking questions like &#8220;would you leave the association if Muslim schools were included?&#8221;and &#8220;Is it in the best interest of Tapps to accept Islamic schools for membership?&#8221;. The results may be even more disturbing. 67% of respondents felt Muslim schools should not be allowed in Tapps.</p>
<p>There are multiple levels to this. First, Tapps is clearly not a friendly place for non-Christians. They are fervent in their beliefs and the beliefs of others not acceptable to them. They don&#8217;t play on their Sabbath, but refused to acknowledge the Jewish Sabbath. They believe that Muslims and Jews are doomed because they do not accept Jesus. (Generally, Christians really believe this, it says so in the <a href="http://www.openbible.info/topics/non_believers" target="_blank">Bible</a>, just many Christians don&#8217;t act on these beliefs in the public sphere.) But they challenge those same beliefs in others. These beliefs are abhorrent and are not acceptable in 2012. One can, <em>no, one must,</em> be fervently religious without being hateful toward other religions.</p>
<p>I am sure there are some of you who think that the questions asked of Muslims are legitimate. I have a few things to say to you. First of all, this is sports league, not a religious debate league. It should not matter one bit what the beliefs of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are with regard to anything other than the scheduling and executing of the league schedule. The idea that the Muslim schools need to be &#8220;vetted&#8221; just so that they could play in the same league is extremely xenophobic.</p>
<p>Second, a questionnaire is not appropriate even if the league were a debate of religion league. They betray a deeply held prejudice against non-members of Christianity in general and an even deeper prejudice for Islam. These kids are living in Texas, not Saudi Arabia! Obviously their parents are more comfortable in a free country like America than they would be in a fascist country. Further, they are asking to play basketball, a Western game. They just want to be American kids. The questioning is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Third the particular questions are even more inappropriate. All religions condemn other religions. That&#8217;s a fact of religions. Move on. Accept it. The Christmas question is hilarious. Christians have asked me with incredulity &#8220;You don&#8217;t celebrate Christmas?!&#8221;. That&#8217;s right. Non-Christians don&#8217;t celebrate Christmas. Why is this an issue? The question that gives it all away is the last one. The &#8220;spread of Islam&#8221; is an irrational fear that has become a deeply rooted fundamental belief of non-Muslims. American Muslims who I know and talk to about these issues have no such agenda. Sure, there are insane fundamentalists who live in backwards, oppressed countries who want to convert the entire world to Islam. They have nothing to do with normal American Muslims. But thanks to the tireless efforts of heroes like Pam Geller, the average, bigoted, non-thinking, Christian American actually thinks that his religious beliefs are under siege from normal American Muslims. This is hate. Pure and simple.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t really blame Tapps. They are just buying what their heroes are selling. I blame those who are selling it. The best way that I know of eliminating hate is by getting to know one another. When people who are different on the outside get to know each other, preconceived notions are burst and understanding and appreciating can begin. The unfortunate result of Tapps&#8217; bigotry is that it reinforces itself by discouraging their schools from increased interaction with the Muslim students. No interaction means no opportunities to unlearn their bigotry. But perhaps that is what Tapps wanted all along.</p>
<p>Although I was willing to overlook Tapps&#8217; faux pas with regard to Beren as simple-mindedness, I am now changing my opinion and declaring them general bigots towards anyone not of the same religious beliefs as them. In 2012 this is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for Christians in Texas and it is unacceptable for Jews and Muslims as well. We are all part of a global community now. Deal with each other in a civil way or go away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Religious-Symbols-II1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5190" title="Religious-Symbols-II1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Religious-Symbols-II1-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="300" /></a>Every religion has abhorrent beliefs. An abhorrent belief is a part of one&#8217;s religion that would offend an outsider. All religions have these beliefs. Whether they concern non-members of the religion, women, slavery, genocide or the afterlife, many religious beliefs are upsetting to members of other religions.</p>
<p>Historically, these beliefs were kept within the bounds of the religious group and no one was the wiser. By and large, people didn&#8217;t have access to religious texts and codes of other religions. There was little interaction between people of various religions. Abhorrent beliefs were safe.</p>
<p>But things have changed. The international community has become like a small village. We all know each other&#8217;s business. Television and the Internet have made us all virtual neighbors. Enemies used to be neighbors or neighboring territories. Now enemies can be anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Last week, one abhorrent belief of Mormonism was exposed (again).<span id="more-5188"></span> I don&#8217;t mean to pick on Mormonism, we will get to Judaism soon. And while on the topic of Mormons, let&#8217;s not forget the comment made by a presidential candidate aide dismissing all Mormons as non-Christians. Anyway, the Church of Latter Day Saints has a practice of <a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;sourceId=1ec52f2324d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____" target="_blank">baptizing all sorts of people who are dead</a>. They don&#8217;t deny it. In fact you can read several fascinating article on the LDS website about the practice. They base it on sources in the Old and New <em>(sic)</em> Testament and in their eyes it is a beautiful honor to the deceased. When it was discovered (again) that they were posthumously baptizing Holocaust victims, outrage ensued. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/elie-wiesel-calls-on-mitt-romney-to-make-mormon-church-stop-proxy-baptisms-of-jews/2012/02/14/gIQAZK6bER_story.html" target="_blank">Elie Wiesel and the Wiesenthal Center demanded that they stop and that they apologize.</a> Somehow Mitt Romney was being asked to apologize as well.</p>
<p>I found myself conflicted. On one hand I have always had a distaste for baptism for the dead. It is the reason I won&#8217;t use a site like Ancestry.com which is owned by the Mormon Church and the data is mined for baptism purposes. I find the practice abhorrent. It really is a little twisted to think about baptizing people who were killed simply because they were Jews! On the other hand I also find it silly and meaningless. Why should it bother me if they say some magic words that in my opinion accomplish absolutely nothing? It&#8217;s a tough call. It&#8217;s certainly not as bad as Elie Wiesel thinks.</p>
<p>Either way, the issue is really what should the Mormon Church do about its abhorrent belief that they should baptize dead non-Mormons? They think they are doing a good and moral act. To outsiders it is offensive. What to do?</p>
<p>Closer to home, Judaism has its fair share of abhorrent beliefs. Most of them no longer apply. Most of them have either been reinterpreted or require circumstances that are not currently at play. Some people want to accelerate those circumstances and create the environment that would allow and require those abhorrent beliefs be put into practice.</p>
<p>Sometimes religious people have abhorrent beliefs or ideas that are not essential to their religion. They may think that these are religious rules, but they are not. These are social conventions that are more likely the result of years of persecution, insularity, and fear as opposed to drawn from religious texts. But the lines are rarely so clear. More recent texts are likely to mix the two and then provide sources for new abhorrent beliefs that are not intrinsic to the religion.</p>
<p>What does the orthodox Jew do about these beliefs?</p>
<p>There are two approaches that I know. The first is based on a famous thought experiment called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma" target="_blank">Euthyphro Dilemma</a>. In short, the idea is that if God commands something it is intrinsically moral. Thus, the social conventions that may make a belief seem abhorrent are really false and true morality only exists in God&#8217;s commandments. This has appeal but it is a tough pill to swallow. Are we really comfortable with Divinely commanded genocide? I&#8217;d rather not have to make that choice. It also seems incongruous that God would create humans who would develop over time into beings whose sense of morality is at odds with God&#8217;s word.</p>
<p>The second approach is to interpret abhorrent beliefs in a way that makes them less abhorrent. This doesn&#8217;t always work, and could rankle the feathers of the more traditionalist among us, but when it works, it works well. For example, there is a commandment to hate (and kill) Amalek. This seems at odds with human perception of fairness and compassion. Over on Hirhurim, R&#8217; Norman Lamm is quoted and I direct your attention there (<a href="http://torahmusings.com/2012/02/when-hatred-is-a-mitzvah/" target="_blank">Hirhurim</a>) as his answer is not relevant to this discussion.</p>
<p>Which all leads to the most fascinating question of all: When these abhorrent beliefs are exposed or shared with outsiders and they make us look bad or old-fashioned, or immoral, or bigoted in the eyes of those outsiders is that a desecration of God&#8217;s Name?</p>
<p>Maimonides codifies several examples of kiddush and chillul Hashem in Chapter 5 of Yesodei HaTorah. None of them really concern the opinions of outsiders about our beliefs. They all concern how we act. There are times we must die for the sake of God&#8217;s commandments and there are other instances where our status as Jews or scholars requires us to act in a refined manner. Failure to do so is a chillul Hashem. The principle of chillul Hashem as it relates to how others think of our beliefs does not enter the conversation.</p>
<p>I think we can safely say that exposing what the Torah says cannot be considered a chillul Hashem.</p>
<p>However, this does not account for social conventions, prejudices, and anti-social ideas that emanate from insularity or superstition that are confused with religious fervor or beliefs. I think it is fair to say that exposing a non-essential abhorrent belief might be a chillul Hashem. That is unfortunately the inevitable result of the new global community. So what is the appropriate response when these secrets are revealed (as they were in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/20/unorthodox-book-review-and-analysis/">Unorthodox</a>)?</p>
<p>The solution is not to cry chillul Hashem and force the issue back into the dark hole from where it came. The solution is to eradicate non-essential abhorrent beliefs. There is little we can do about our essential beliefs that don&#8217;t jive with modern sensibilities. We have to hope that others recognize that every religion and even many non-religions have abhorrent beliefs and so long as they don&#8217;t cause any harm, they can be ignored. Much in the same way as I can ignore baptism of the dead. But if there are non-essential abhorrent beliefs in our community that can be changed or removed, I think it is wise and prudent to do all that we can to eliminate these items from our community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5179" title="41QYpzLBEwL" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/41QYpzLBEwL-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1439187002" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. It is unorthodox. It is a rejection. But I did not find it scandalous. Not at all.</p>
<p>There is so much about this book that needs to be discussed. Let&#8217;s get a bit of insignificant criticism out of the way. For starters, I found the writing decent. Not excellent. It got better as the book progressed, but the early chapters were tedious in my opinion. The writing is over-descriptive to a fault. Too many sentences have too many adjectives and adverbs. The book doesn&#8217;t allow the reader any imagination. There&#8217;s no room for the reader to breath. It&#8217;s sensory overload. It&#8217;s almost like the author is trying too hard to prove herself as a good writer. Personally, I found it quite annoying.</p>
<p>The story is unremarkable. Shorter version of the book: Girl raised by her grandparents because her mother is a lesbian who left the community and her father is mentally ill has high anxiety and feels constrained by the limiting lifestyle of her community eventually leaves the community. It&#8217;s not a story we haven&#8217;t heard before nor is it a story we will not hear again.</p>
<p>The truth is that anyone with high anxiety will not have an easy time in any tight-knit, insular community. It&#8217;s not really that chasidic Judaism didn&#8217;t work for Deborah. It&#8217;s that her difficult childhood and personality didn&#8217;t work well in the high pressure society of chasidic Judaism. She probably would have been fine in a more moderate form of orthodox Judaism. Unfortunately for her, she was born into extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Honestly, there was nothing &#8220;scandalous&#8221; in the book. (I will address the one scandal that has been manufactured at the end of this post).<span id="more-5177"></span> In other words, the book, fairly accurately describes the life of a chasidic girl in Williamsburg. It is insular. Education is placed at a minimum. Marriage is the goal of childhood, motherhood is the goal of adulthood. This is no scandalous. This is fact.</p>
<p>There are in fact, renegade renegade mikva attendants. There are libido charged teenage boys who are inappropriate toward girls (and other boys). There are stories of talking fish. People did burn their wigs. Secular books are frowned upon. Superstitions are rampant. People gossip. Especially about young married couples. There is abuse and it is covered up. There is prejudice against members of other chasidic sects and certainly against non-chasidic Jews, especially modern orthodox Jews and Sephardic Jews. Strange tales like eating pig will make you vomit are told. These are just the expected social conventions of the insular chasidic community. Nothing to see here.</p>
<p>But are these items an indictment of the entire chasidic community? Certainly not. Bad people and dumb ideas exist everywhere. The biggest gripe I have is simply the imaginary principle that there are no bad people or dumb ideas in the community. There are and knowing there are goes a long way to fixing those people and ideas.</p>
<p>The book brought me to tears twice. For a sap like me, that is not a good showing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> made me cry a ton of times. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen: The Hidden Lives of Hasidic Rebels</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0807036277&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> moved me to tears a bunch of times. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> was not an emotional book. The only moments for me were the birth of her child and the when she and her son come to grips with the fact that the unhappy, broken, marriage is over. That&#8217;s it. The rest felt a bit detached and unremarkable.</p>
<p>But I like to find social commentary and universal lessons in this kind of book and I think there are some important issues the book raises.</p>
<p>Deborah&#8217;s personality is to question and to learn. In her community this is a dangerous trait. Her first step off the path was learning Talmud. That&#8217;s an innocent curiosity in most orthodox communities, even for a girl. But Deborah had to hide it. She couldn&#8217;t ask questions about what she had learned. With this her rebellion began.</p>
<p>Although Deborah relates to her grandmother as a rebel. I don&#8217;t think she realized how special her grandfather was. At least, what is recorded in the book paints Zaidy as a good guy. He avoids the Satmar politics. He is willing to read a newspaper after 9/11. He doesn&#8217;t believe in superstition and stories like the talking fish in New Square. He is also a bit of a rebel. In my eyes, Zaidy is a reasonable guy throughout most of the book. What&#8217;s unfortunate is one negative portrayal made its way onto the book jacket. But other than that incident, he seems to be a good guy. I think that his independence of allegiance and thought are worthy of praise and if more of his neighbors were like him, I think many issues in the insular community would be mitigated.</p>
<p>Her shortlived marriage leaves many unanswered questions. I would have liked more details. She says they fight. About what? The book doesn&#8217;t elaborate. She talks about their neighbors in Airmont. I am from Monsey, I know those people. I would have liked more about that period of her life. The life of what has become known as a &#8220;Tuna Beigel&#8221;. They dress somewhat chasidic but are much more liberated. Why didn&#8217;t that lifestyle work for Deborah? These are areas of the book that feel rushed and unfinished.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the book was the twist of fate that began with a visit to a Kabbalist. He told Deborah that her number was &#8220;nine&#8221;. On 9/9/9 just after midnight, Deborah had a life-changing motor vehicle accident. She says that the Kabbalist was right. Her number was nine. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think that is what the Kabbalist had in mind. But it&#8217;s poetic justice that his words were used by Deborah to rationalize her departure from the community.</p>
<p>The overall &#8220;lesson&#8221; of the book, if there is one, is that her whole life, as a good Chasidic girl, Deborah was taught to trust her intellect over her impulse. She was supposed to use her knowledge of Jewish law and thought to guide her and not allow her emotions and passions. Her freedom came when she put her impulse ahead of her intellect. Judaism is really all about placing one&#8217;s intellect above their impulse. Everyone from Maimonides to Luzzato talks about this. The trick is to channel one&#8217;s impulse into positive, creative, useful activity. One is not required to suppress everything about one&#8217;s self. Rather, one is supposed to use the intellect to guide one&#8217;s passions and creativity. The goal is to use one&#8217;s personality to improve the world.</p>
<p>More balanced, moderate forms of orthodox Judaism provide a better framework for avoiding this damaging problem. Most careers and opportunities are available to orthodox Jews. There are a few exceptions. Perhaps it would be useful for the more moderate versions of orthodox Judaism to focus on this aspect of Judaism. Even better, if the more insular versions of orthodox Judaism like the chasidic sects mentioned in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> or the new insular communities in the non-chasidic world would allow these doors to be opened for their communities.</p>
<p>There is somewhat of a happy ending to the book, even for religious, orthodox Jews. Feldman says that she is still proud to be a Jew. In a different sense than before, but still, she is not a &#8220;self hating Jew&#8221; as some have claimed. This is a positive development in light of her difficulties with her community,</p>
<p>To close, allow me to address what has become the biggest controversy over this book: The murder cover-up.</p>
<p>Feldman tells the story of her brother-in-law calling their home and telling them that a heinous murder had just occurred in Kiryas Joel. He was personally there as a Hatzalah member and he claimed that there was a cover-up of the murder.</p>
<p>In the book, the story is told as a rumor. The book makes no claim as to whether or not there was a murder. The only claim being made is that this is what she was told. The point of the story is to illustrate that no one would have a hard time believing that a murder was covered up. As a reader, I am deeply troubled that a rumor like this is even possible. But I did not ever think that Feldman was reporting on something with facts to back it up. This was a record of a conversation that she recalled. The issues that remain are not whether or not there was a murder. It is a much more basic issue. Whether or not a murder could or would be covered up. I don&#8217;t think anyone would find this impossible, what with all the cover-ups of sex abuse, domestic abuse, fraud and corruption. That is the real issue. Whether or not she should have investigated and looked at police reports is irrelevant in my opinion. I don&#8217;t think Feldman thought that including this anecdote in the book would be as scandalous as it has become. I would have preferred if the she had made it clearer that the episode was rumor. But that is how I took it.</p>
<p>In my opinion, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> is a good book. Some are calling it a chillul Hashem. I find this ironic. Here is a woman who left the community. She tells her story. The story seems entirely plausible. But because she left it is chillul Hashem. Yet, when people who stay in the communirty commit crimes, acts of violence, are unseemly for other reasons, that is not a chillul Hashem. Quite the double standard if you ask me. All communities have what I call &#8220;abhorrent beliefs&#8221;. Is it a chillul Hashem when our abhorrent beliefs or practices are exposed truthfully? That&#8217;s a hard question to answer.  More important is the challenge of dealing with them in a modern world. This will be addressed in a future post. Maybe even tomorrow.<em> (Update: Posted - <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/21/what-to-do-about-abhorrent-beliefs-in-religions/">What to Do About Abhorrent Beliefs in Religions?</a>).</em></p>
<p>Should you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a>? It&#8217;s interesting enough. Deborah&#8217;s story is unique enough to hold your interest. The inside information about the insular communities of Williamsburg and beyond is worth your time. If you are looking for high drama and massive scandals look elsewhere. It&#8217;s &#8220;good reading&#8221;. Not &#8220;can&#8217;t miss reading&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5100" title="51CKG07JF5L._SS500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/51CKG07JF5L._SS500_-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Menachem Kellner is a scholar par excellence. I enjoy his books, and other writings very much. One book that I particularly enjoyed was the provocatively titled: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a></p>
<p>The book is not really about what the title implies. Instead, the book is an analysis of required beliefs in Judaism. It is an excellent book and a joy to read. I heartily recommend the book to anyone interested in the evolution of fundamental beliefs in Judaism.</p>
<p>One important issue that is thoroughly discussed is the importance the Sages of the Mishna and Talmud placed on actions while placing less importance on faith or beliefs. This is true. But the significance of this fact is debatable. That is because faith or belief in a deity was a basic assumption of life in the era in which the Sages lived. One had to be insane to be an atheist 2000 years ago. How would one even begin to explain the world in which they lived. However, today one can certainly be sane and deny the existence of God. In fact, some might argue that the tables have turned and belief in God is the less sane position. After all, there is no scientific proof of an all-knowing, all-powerful Creator. So, while I enjoyed the discussion in the book about actions having more meaning than beliefs in the eyes of the Sages, how well that transfers to modern times is another discussion entirely.</p>
<p>Another core point of the book is that in adopting the 13 Fundamental Beliefs of Maimonides there is an odd irony.<span id="more-5099"></span> On the one hand, Maimonides the Rationalist lost. By this I mean that Judaism today is mostly not the Judaism of Maimonides. Today&#8217;s Judaism is dominated by metaphysics, mysticism, and Zohar-centric Kabbalah. The Judaism of Maimonides functioned without  these elements. (For a thorough analysis and discussion of this point see Kellner&#8217;s book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158">Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation with Mysticism</a>.) So Maimonides lost. He tried to establish a Judaism free from these non-essential elements but he failed. The public rejected his approach.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the public embraced the revolutionary suggestion of Maimonides that there are 13 fundamental beliefs and what those beliefs actually entail. There were other fundamental belief systems proposed by others and Judaism may have got along just fine without a formal expression of fundamental beliefs.</p>
<p>Yet, here we are today. The public has rejected rationalism and embraced fundamental beliefs. Isn&#8217;t it ironic?</p>
<p>The final part of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a> is a polemic. Kellner argues that it should be okay to relegate the 13 Fundamental Beliefs for the sake of Jewish Unity. His proposal is based on the assumption that Orthodox Jewish rabbis and non-rabbis avoid working with non-orthodox rabbis and non-rabbis. There is no conversation or joint agenda in which orthodox and non-orthodox Jews  participate. Further, Kellner assumes that this plain fact is because of the halachic prohibition that proscribes a believer from engaging with a heretic. The logic follows that since by the lights of the 13 Fundamental Principles there is a presumption that non-orthodox Jews are technically heretics. Hence, it is forbidden to engage them. This, according to Kellner is the reason there is no communication between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. Kellner then argues that for the sake of unity, continuity, and peace we should discard with a highly literal usage of Maimonides fundamental beliefs and open the lines of communication with non-orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>One might suspect that I would agree with Kellner on this matter. In principle I do. I wrote about it here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/">There is No Tent</a>. I think we should increase communication and interaction with all Jews. But I don&#8217;t agree with Kellner&#8217;s logic here. Not at all.</p>
<p>The reason there is little interaction between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews has very little to do with halacha. It has a lot to do with social concerns. The orthodox establishment is more concerned with their children and keeping their children orthodox than the nitty-gritty of whether or not it is permissible to engage with the non-orthodox. In other words, the real reason there is little interaction between the groups is because the orthodox are concerned about the influence that non-orthodox will have over their children or even themselves. It is a matter of insulation and isolation, not a matter of halacha.</p>
<p>And so, it makes little difference to the orthodox Jew that fundamentals of faith are a novel introduction by Maimonides or that there are other codes of faith that could be acceptable. What does matter is that access to a world of Judaism that does not follow the chain of halacha that is followed by orthodox Jews could &#8220;corrupt&#8221; orthodox Jews and they may jump ship. It is merely circling the wagons. It is not a halachic decision.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kellner&#8217;s ambitious and admirable suggestion is a non-starter. Unless the orthodox Jewish community can foster a confidence in its principles and ideals to the point that interaction is not considered a spiritual danger, I don&#8217;t foresee a change in approach. As a pure academic exercise, the recommendation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a> is bold and exciting to me. But in a practical sense, it is lacking.</p>
<p>The only way intra-Jewish relations will change significantly is if our leadership suggests that it has value and that value trumps overzealous concerns over assimilation. I hope it does change.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a> and thinking about its many fascinating points for discussion. If you have read it let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/01/02/yossi-sarid-shows-us-the-ugly-side-of-secular-extremism/" target="_blank">Yesterday, I wrote about Yossi Sarid&#8217;s disgraceful article of vile hatred for halachic Judaism</a>. I expressed my discomfort in writing a point by point response because when first started to write a point by point rebuttal, it came off as sounded apologetic and disingenuous. I was not able to articulate how and why Sarid was wrong in every one of his examples. I tried. But I was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yair Hoffman also tried. His article is a lot like the one I was writing. It explains a few of the statements that Sarid misquoted or misinterpreted. More importantly it provides quite a few important sources that indicate reverence, respect and admiration for women in the Talmud. Clearly, Sarid ignores as many, if not more, sources than he barbarically wields in his unscrupulous attack on halacha.</p>
<p>This is great work by Rabbi Hoffman. But in the end all he has done is presented another side to the story. He has shown that the Talmud has statements that are praiseworthy or women and there are also statements that portray women negatively. This is because he does not refute the majority of Sarid&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>I decided to analyze the debate systematically.<span id="more-5004"></span></p>
<p>Saird mentions 16 negative sources in his article. Rabbi Hoffman addresses FOUR of them. Of the TWELVE he ignores, some of them are the most difficult to explain.</p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman uses a variety of methods to refute the four sources he actually addresses.</p>
<p>Sarid says: <em>&#8220;She is unfit for any public position with authority. &#8220;Thou shalt appoint a king over thee&#8221; &#8211; a king and not a queen.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman employs the &#8220;it is literal but it&#8217;s not so bad&#8221; argument. Meaning, yes it is true, but many other cultures and countries have had similar laws. Okay. Fair enough.</p>
<p>Sarid says: <em>&#8221; words of Torah should be burned rather than being given to women.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman correctly declares that this is out of context. It is true that the Talmud says this in the name of one rabbi, but since the Talmud actually addresses the question the woman asked that prompted the statement, clearly the rabbis felt that the question was a good question and this is really praise of a woman. While all of this is true, the statement remains in the text unchallenged. This is still offensive. Advantage Sarid.</p>
<p>Sarid mentions the prohibition against one who <em>&#8221; looks even at a woman&#8217;s little finger&#8221;.</em></p>
<p><em></em> Rabbi Hoffman explains that this is actually a preferred approach to women. In effect in &#8216;deobjectifies&#8217; women because it ensures that women will not be looked at as pure objects of desire. In fact it ensures that women will not be looked at, at all. Not a great job by Rabbi Hoffman, he could have added that the translation of Sarid is not perfect. It would be more accurate to state that the prohibition is against &#8220;gazing&#8221; at a women with lust.</p>
<p>One of Sarid&#8217;s last complaints is the statement in the Talmud that &#8220;calls women&#8221;, and I quote, <em>&#8220;a sack full of excrement&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman is absolutely correct here. Sarid willfully distorts this source. The Talmud is saying that EVEN if a woman was a  &#8220;a sack full of excrement&#8221; a man would desire her physically. This is a statement about the strength of physical attraction. It is not a referendum on women. Sarid loses this one badly.</p>
<p>So in the four points of attack, Rabbi Hoffman argues valiantly. In some places he is better than others. But he does a good job.</p>
<p>The problem is that there are TWELVE more sources that go unaddressed. Among them, the most difficult to reconcile. Rabbi Hoffman does not address the law that prohibits women from testifying in court or becoming a judge, nor does he address the statement criticizing those who teach their daughters Torah. He ignores the obligation to save a drowning man before a drowning woman, he ignores the Talmud&#8217;s statement that allows men to divorce without his wife&#8217;s consent and the requirement that women be at her husband&#8217;s disposal when he desires her.</p>
<p>Some of these statements can be explained. Others really cannot. In some ways Sarid is right. The world does not look upon many of these laws and statements favorably.</p>
<p>In none of his explanations does Rabbi Hoffman invoke the argument that things may have changed since the time of the Talmud. In no place does he say that the statements in the Talmud are reflective of an ancient society and that we have evolved from that society into a more contemporary version of Rabbinic Judaism. Rabbi Hoffman is not willing to say, in any case, that these any of sources are actually offensive and have fallen into disuse or reinterpreted because they are offensive.</p>
<p>In my opinion, that might be the only way to answer some of the questions raised by Sarid. But for some, saying this amounts to kefira or at least knocks one out of orthodox Judaism. But isn&#8217;t it true? Have we not adapted and evolved since the times of the Talmud? I think we have. I think it is also futile to deny it. I would really love to see a bona fide, contemporary Torah authority legitimize this approach. I can dream, can&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>This approach will not answer all the questions either. It will not fix some of the built-in disadvantages that women encounter in halachic Judaism. But I think it is more honest and gives us a chance to continue to adapt and evolve if necessary <em>and if our rabbinic leadership allows it</em>. But freezing us in time as Rabbi Hoffman has done will not win every argument. In this case it only won four out of sixteen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/220px-Yossi_Sarid.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4998" title="220px-Yossi_Sarid" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/220px-Yossi_Sarid-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" /></a>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>I read the recent op-ed written by Yossi Sarid and published in Haaretz. I found the article highly offensive, despicable and ugly. I thought I would &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking" target="_blank">fisk</a>&#8221; the article and counter each and every one of Sarid&#8217;s twisted, angry points. I got through about half of Sarid&#8217;s ugly diatribe and I was forced to quit. I could not win. I was unable to refute every one of his points without twisting myself, Chazal and halacha into a stale pretzel.</p>
<p>So I gave up.</p>
<p>Instead, I offer two independant points in this blog post inspired by Sarid&#8217;s disgraceful article.</p>
<p>Sarid&#8217;s main point is that the extremists in Israel are only applying the lessons that are taught in our holy tradition. He proceeds to quote several sources that demonstrate his view of the way Judaism treats women. A few of his sources are misquoted. A few others are opinions of one rabbi and not every rabbi. But by and large, one can build a solid case against orthodox Judaism&#8217;s approach to women using Sarid&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>By pointing to these sources, Sarid proposes that the extremists are just following the logical conclusions of halacha and traditional Judaism. Therefore the problem is not the extremists, the problem is all Jews who adhere to halacha. All forms of Judaism that believe in the veracity of Torah are to blamed. This is akin to one of Hitchens&#8217; more well-known arguments against religion. If extremists can follow the text of a religion and be bad people there is a flaw in the religion. Sarid lumps all Jews who follow halacha together. The extremists are extremists but only because they follow the same texts as I do, they just do it better.</p>
<p>Sarid is wrong. Dead Wrong.<span id="more-4997"></span> He is wrong because the extremists may be following the texts that he cites. But halachic Judaism does not follow those texts today. Yes. Believe it or not, even the most charedi of Jews do not have the same beliefs about women that some of our great rabbis had throughout our history. He claims that halacha prohibits teaching women Torah. This is obviously very easy to refute. Every orthodox Jewish woman studies Torah. This is an evolution of Judaism to conform to modernity. Some things are up for negotiation. Some things are not. But to represent orthodox Judaism as a whole by quoting a few obscure (and few less obscure) texts is ugly.</p>
<p>It is ugly because in practice, 99% of orthodox Jews don&#8217;t agree with the texts he quoted. The 1% who do are the extremists. Thus, is it disingenuous and provocative to lump all orthodox Jews together with regard to the way women are treated in orthodox Judaism. For this I am fuming with anger at Yossi Sarid. How dare he take a few quotes and a few crazies and paint the entire spectrum of orthodox Judaism with that brush? It is inexcusable. I hope he can find his way and retract his article. An apology would be appropriate as well.</p>
<p>The second point is that these texts do exist. They do need to be dealt with in a mature way. I am not qualified to dismiss these texts and I would not dare make a unilateral statement about these texts. But it would be wise for our rabbinic leadership (and by <em>our</em> rabbinic leadership, I mean the orthodox Jewish leadership from across the spectrum) to formulate responses and interpretations or dismissals of these texts. We need to have an approach that codifies the modern approaches that we have taken towards women over the last few centuries. The offensive texts cannot remain the only authoratative views on women.</p>
<p>It is clear and without a doubt that attitudes have changed towards women over the last 2500 years. This is not a Jewish phenomenon. Women have only had the right to vote and own land for a relatively short amount of time in the secular world. Jewish law has adapted as well. Women work outside the home. Women learn Torah. Women are expected to be treated with as much respect as one would like to be treated by others.</p>
<p>The problem is that the most authoratative sources that remain are those that are no longer followed by the majority of orthodox Jews. We need to educate ourselves and hateful people like Yossi Sarid that neither those texts, nor the extremists represent mainstream halachic Judaism.</p>
<p>I suggest you read Sarid&#8217;s diatribe. If only so that you should know what kind of perception one can have if one cherry picks from the traditional sources and to try to figure a way to explain these texts without becoming overly apologetic and without rejecting the sanctity of our tradition.</p>
<p>As much as I hate what the religious extremists are doing to pervert Torah Judaism, I hate what Yossi Sarid has written even more.</p>

I saw it just after I wrote about the modern day exorcist here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/28/demons-dybbuks-devils-and-exorcism/" target="_blank">Demons, Dybbuks, Devils and Exorcism</a>. Buying this book was a smart decision. I read the book a little while back and neglected to do a review but I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you all about this book since I read it.</p>
<p>The author, J.H Chajes, is a professor at University of Haifa. He is a distant relative of the great Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> is very scholarly and well researched. Yet, it reads like a novel, well almost like a novel, and it kept me engrossed in its content from start to finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> chronicles the rise of recorded incidents of dybbuks and exorcism in the era of mystical writings of the Arizal&#8217;s students. Most of the book takes place in the 16th and 17th centuries. The book traces the relationship between Christian, Muslim and Jewish exorcism legends and practice as well. An appendix has full accounts of exorcisms found in rabbinic literature from that era.</p>
<p>As a skeptic, I found the restraint of Chajes astounding. It is almost as if he is winking the entire time that he is writing about demonic / disembodied soul possession. You just know that he can&#8217;t believe what he is writing as fact is even possible. But he writes as an objective 3rd party about rabbis and others performing exorcisms with a straight face.</p>
<p>There are a few points that I took away from the book that are worth sharing.<span id="more-4968"></span> First of all, the book mentions some disputes between rabbis. They were vicious disagreements. Accusations of philandering, abject immorality and horrible insults are hurled the way of one particular rabbi. I can only imagine what our rabbinic disputes will look like to historians some time in the future. Fascinating to read and fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>Second, the book supports the theory that &#8220;the more knowledge becomes accessible, the more some religious leaders will try to &#8216;esotericize&#8217; their religion to maintain a level of separation between the masses and the public&#8221;. I know, that theory is a mouthful. With regard to exorcism it works as follows. The masses were becoming more literate throughout the world. Exorcism was an art reserved for spiritual leaders and scholars. It was not available to the masses no matter how learned they became. Thus, the existence of demons and dybbuks reinforced the need for leadership. It is similar to today&#8217;s maximalist position of Daas Torah. In a time that more orthodox Jews can study the sources and responsa on a given subject, the religious leaders have reserved a segment of inaccessible knowledge under the maximalist position of Daas Torah. I&#8217;m not saying this is wrong or intentional, rather it is a pattern and it happens.</p>
<p>My third point for this review is the nature of the relationship between Jewish scholars and their Christian and Muslim counterparts. It seems that there was much interaction between them and they worked together, at least for the sake of exorcism. It was nice to see cooperation instead of the stereotypical debates and polemics against one another. If they could do it, so could we.</p>
<p>If you have ANY interest in dybbuks or demons or exorcism or 16th century mysticism, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a>.</p>
