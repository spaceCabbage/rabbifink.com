				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6895" alt="clip_image002" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/clip_image002-300x248.gif" width="300" height="248" />Professor Jack Wertheimer of the Jewish Theological Seminary (Conservative &#8211; not the Commentary Magazine kind, the Jewish kind) published a lengthy, <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-outreach-revolution/" target="_blank">thorough article on kiruv in the orthodox Jewish community</a>. It comes on the heels of two consecutive Klal Perspectives Journal issues on kiruv. He even quotes one article from KP.</p>
<p>First of all, Wertheimer gets kiruv and he gets the issues it creates. I commend him for writing an article as outsider while somehow grasping many of the nuances of kiruv in the orthodox Jewish world. It was very well done. I was impressed. That being said, he does make a few points that don&#8217;t pass the smell test.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the good observations. First, the article combines Chabad outreach and &#8220;everyone else&#8221;. I am not sure that makes sense. Chabad mostly functions independently of the rest of orthodox Judaism, especially in kiruv. Wertheimer comments that Chabad is sometimes viewed disparagingly by the non-Chabad orthodox Jews and even by the non-kiruv Chabad community. So while the numbers of of kiruv workers are staggering if one includes Chabad, it&#8217;s not so clear that they should be included in the same category as everyone else. Aside from the differences in perspective and allegiances, Chabad outreach is not always outreach, Wertheimer notes. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a service. Is a public service the same as kiruv? Maybe. But many non-Chabad people would say it is not.</p>
<p>The article proposes that the large number of kiruv workers is partially a result of more orthodox Jews who need jobs. This is true. For some people, kiruv is a paycheck. This might explain some of the diminished returns. The numbers in the 1990&#8242;s were higher than they are now. When it was a &#8220;calling&#8221; one could expect more success. Now it is just a job for a lot of people. That might make a difference.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about the article for me was that Wertheimer claims that in confidence non-Chabad kiruv workers told him that they consider it a success even if a prospect does not become orthodox.</p>
<p><span id="more-6894"></span></p>
<p>It is a success even if the prospect is more likely to attend a conservative or reform service. This surprised me. It does not reflect my experience. But while I concede that kiruv workers may be satisfied with that kind of return, their donors are not. Wertheimer notes that donors expect a greater return on their investment. &#8220;<em>Donors are increasingly linking their largesse to quotas: One funder insists that each campus outreach worker must reel in at least seven college students annually. Not surprisingly, these pressures have resulted in creative bookkeeping — and demoralization when unrealistic goals cannot be met.&#8221; </em> I alluded to this in my kiruv article as well. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/28/a-different-kiruv-paradigm/">A Different Kiruv Paradigm</a>)</p>
<p>Werheimer&#8217;s estimated numbers are staggering. He estimates that the &#8220;<em>collective impact of Orthodox outreach may touch between a half million and 700,000 Jews each year, rivaling the impact of the Conservative and Reform movements, and in the majority of cases complementing and enhancing the work of those important movements. </em>To think that we have that kind of influence among the other denominations is incredible.</p>
<p>He goes through some of the tension between orthodox kiruv workers and non-orthodox rabbis as well. One thing I had not thought of was the free Bar Mitzvah lessons and free admission to services on the High Holidays severely cutting into the bottom line of conservative and reform congregations. This is an area that needs to be addressed. We cannot cannibalize non-orthodox institutions.</p>
<p>Also mentioned is the questionable practices of using chicanery or smooth-talking to bait kiruv prospects. It&#8217;s deplorable and he could have spent even more time on it.</p>
<p>Further, the article notes that kiruv is not really a great match for today&#8217;s insular frum communities. He quotes the excellent article by Rabbi Ilan Feldman in Klal Perspectives. <em>“To effectively inspire people to become observant, the effort must be done in isolation from the established Orthodox community,” Rabbi Ilan Feldman laments. “Frum communities as cultures are simply not conducive to outreach.”</em> This is lamentable, but true. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/20/one-excellent-article-from-the-new-klal-perspectives-kiruv-issue/">One Excellent Article From Klal Perspectives Fall 2012 on Kiruv</a>)</p>
<p>The article concludes on a hopeful note. Wertheimer hopes that the ad hoc collaboration of kiruv with non-orthodox institutions can bolster American Jewry. <em>&#8220;The American Jewish community can rely upon a new resource to complement existing religious movements, synagogues, and educational institutions in their collective mission to inspire Jews of all ages to draw closer to their religious tradition.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>One thing that seemed improbable to me was the assertion that most kiruv success stories are formerly conservative Jews. My experience has been the complete opposite. That is, the <em>less </em>one knows about Judaism, the more likely one is to become frum. Conservative Jews are pretty educated and usually are passionate about their traditions. These are the people that are least likely to jump ship and go the orthodox route. Yet, for some reason Wertheimer asserts that they are the most likely. The entire article is devoid of footnotes. This is one area that the omission of footnotes is especially glaring. Perhaps Werhteimer&#8217;s conservative roots are coloring his perspective here.</p>
<p>But the most glaring issue to me was Wertheimer&#8217;s assumption that this is considered &#8220;working together&#8221;. He paints this whole thing as orthodox rabbis working <em>with </em>theconservative and reform movement. As if it&#8217;s some kind of partnership. I don&#8217;t agree. A partnership is where two groups work together. Kiruv can at best be viewed as supplementary. I think that calling it a partnership is a bit disingenuous at this point.</p>
<p>What are we to make of this article?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s remarkable that kiruv is such a huge industry that it is being written up in somewhat glowing terms by a conservative Jewish professor. The assumption has always been that kiruv is viewed as the enemy by non-orthodox Jews. It certainly did not feel that way reading Wertheimer&#8217;s article.</p>
<p>More importantly, an outsider who understands kiruv has some great advice. I think his criticisms must be considered.</p>
<p>But above all, I think we need to rethink the entire paradigm. We, as orthodox Jews, should be able to figure out a way to work together with the non-orthodox for real. Not just as supplements and not just as a safety net. We should be permitted and we should be able to partner in events and programs in which we share common goals. We should seek out such events and make them a priority. Wertheimer insinuates that orthodox Jews no longer view non-orthodox Jews as an enemy. This is only slightly true in some less insular quarters. But we can make it true for all orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, the war is over. No one is really deciding between orthodox Judaism and conservative or reform Judaism. Now the battle is all the denominations vs. secularism and apathy. We are on the same team now. It&#8217;s time to take kiruv to the next level and integrate with non-orthodox Jews for the sake of friendship and brotherhood. It can&#8217;t just be for the sake of kiruv. Those days are gone. Now it is time for real kiruv &#8211; closeness. A closeness for the pure sake of being close.</p>
<p>I think this article tells us that we can do just that. Now let&#8217;s do it.</p>
